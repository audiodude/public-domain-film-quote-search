00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:19,181
[horn honks]

2
00:00:21,404 --> 00:00:24,323
- [horn honks]
- [vehicle approaches]

3
00:01:40,616 --> 00:01:41,908
[woman screams]

4
00:01:41,937 --> 00:01:44,355
[gunshots]

5
00:03:53,613 --> 00:03:56,740
When you get to the next intersection,
why don't you turn south?

6
00:03:56,825 --> 00:04:00,453
Chocolate Mountains are east. Well, they
were the last time we headed that way.

7
00:04:00,537 --> 00:04:03,664
Who needs the mountains?
Why don't we go to San Felipe?

8
00:04:03,748 --> 00:04:06,208
Nothing to do in San Felipe but fish.

9
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:08,127
Well...

10
00:04:08,211 --> 00:04:10,546
that was the idea, wasn't it?

11
00:04:11,423 --> 00:04:12,673
Yeah, I guess so.

12
00:04:14,551 --> 00:04:16,969
We might just pick up a drink in Mexicali.

13
00:04:18,472 --> 00:04:20,890
Remember Floribel at the Alhambra Club?

14
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:23,225
Yeah.

15
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,312
She's probably dead by now.
That was a long time ago.

16
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:30,232
Yeah. Poor old Floribel.

17
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:32,818
Well, there's no harm
in drinking a toast to her.

18
00:04:32,903 --> 00:04:34,111
Okay.

19
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,492
You know, except for the war,
this is the first time

20
00:04:39,576 --> 00:04:41,702
I've been away from Maudie and the kids.

21
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:43,829
- You wanna turn back?
- No, no, no.

22
00:04:43,914 --> 00:04:45,414
We've come this far.

23
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,543
[sighs] Mexicali's
beginning to sound good.

24
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,179
Just maybes.

25
00:05:00,263 --> 00:05:02,681
[horns honking]

26
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:06,060
I remember that joint.

27
00:05:10,774 --> 00:05:13,192
[muttering] The Alhambra...

28
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,988
It's right down the block.

29
00:05:36,091 --> 00:05:39,468
[man speaking Spanish]

30
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:41,762
This is the place, señor, come right in.

31
00:05:41,846 --> 00:05:45,516
Juanita's just starting
her famous fan dance. You're just in time.

32
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,769
Ah, might as well take a look.
Hey, Gil! Gil?

33
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:52,022
- [groans]
- Mmm.

34
00:05:52,107 --> 00:05:54,275
Sorry, friend, no sale.

35
00:06:01,741 --> 00:06:05,244
Oh, well. San Felipe, here we come.

36
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:25,764
- Out of gas?
- Yeah.

37
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:27,391
Hop in.

38
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:38,986
We're going to San Felipe. You can pick up
some gas there and hitch a ride back.

39
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,157
- Waiting out there long?
- Yeah.

40
00:06:47,037 --> 00:06:49,163
Gil, light me a cigarette.

41
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:54,835
Smoke?

42
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,004
No.

43
00:06:58,965 --> 00:07:00,299
What are you doing, rolling 'em?

44
00:07:03,428 --> 00:07:04,845
Face front!

45
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,515
And keep driving.

46
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:12,603
Sure, I'm Emmett Myers.

47
00:07:14,272 --> 00:07:16,523
Do what I tell you,
and don't make no fast moves.

48
00:07:16,608 --> 00:07:19,610
There are a lot of dead heroes
back there got nervous.

49
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:24,948
From now on while you're driving,

50
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:26,433
keep both hands high on that wheel.

51
00:07:26,493 --> 00:07:29,328
And you, keep one hand
along the top of this seat...

52
00:07:30,413 --> 00:07:32,748
the other hand, high on that window.

53
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:39,004
All right. Now turn off
the next side road we come to.

54
00:07:50,225 --> 00:07:51,684
Pull up.

55
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,565
Open the glove compartment.

56
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:06,240
What's the box?

57
00:08:06,324 --> 00:08:08,909
- [Gilbert] Cartridges, .22s.
- [Myers] Give 'em to me.

58
00:08:14,374 --> 00:08:15,874
Close it.

59
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:23,048
Now this is how we get out after this.

60
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:25,050
First, give me the keys.

61
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,806
Now we all get out the side, this one.

62
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,058
I get out first, then you.

63
00:08:33,143 --> 00:08:36,145
Stand away from the car. And then you.

64
00:08:37,105 --> 00:08:38,230
Let's go.

65
00:08:45,822 --> 00:08:47,906
Drop your jackets around your elbows.

66
00:08:57,584 --> 00:08:59,501
Turn around.

67
00:09:02,338 --> 00:09:05,174
We're gonna open the trunk. Move.

68
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,183
Pull your jackets up.

69
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,979
You, open the trunk.

70
00:09:19,063 --> 00:09:20,663
Both of you, keep your hands on the lid.

71
00:09:25,195 --> 00:09:26,445
Throw me the keys.

72
00:09:27,989 --> 00:09:29,531
Now get the blankets.

73
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,117
[Emmett] You'd never make it!

74
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:35,496
Get the groceries, you.

75
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:41,752
- Whose gun is that?
- Mine.

76
00:09:41,836 --> 00:09:43,879
- You like to shoot?
- Yeah.

77
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:46,632
So do I.

78
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:49,009
So I'm warning you,
don't try anything smart with me.

79
00:09:49,844 --> 00:09:51,178
Move!

80
00:10:17,914 --> 00:10:20,624
[Emmett fiddling with gun]

81
00:10:35,682 --> 00:10:37,724
I told you my name. What's yours?

82
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:39,226
Mine's Gilbert Bowen.

83
00:10:40,895 --> 00:10:42,604
He's Roy Collins.

84
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:44,773
What do you do for a living?

85
00:10:44,858 --> 00:10:48,443
I'm a draftsman. He runs a garage.

86
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:50,654
That makes you smarter.

87
00:10:50,738 --> 00:10:52,823
Or does it?

88
00:10:52,907 --> 00:10:54,867
[trigger clicks]

89
00:10:54,951 --> 00:10:56,971
You oughta be all over that windshield.
You got lucky.

90
00:10:56,995 --> 00:11:00,622
It hit an empty chamber.
I had to use it a while back.

91
00:11:00,707 --> 00:11:04,251
Now don't make any more fast moves! I told
you, the last guy made that mistake.

92
00:11:34,365 --> 00:11:35,908
When are you due back?

93
00:11:36,743 --> 00:11:38,035
No particular time.

94
00:11:40,163 --> 00:11:43,040
Yeah, we told our wives
to expect us home when we got there.

95
00:11:43,124 --> 00:11:44,625
You got wives, huh?

96
00:11:45,543 --> 00:11:46,835
Any kids?

97
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,128
I have.

98
00:11:48,212 --> 00:11:51,173
Just keep thinking how nice
it'll be to see 'em again.

99
00:11:56,471 --> 00:11:58,472
There's the checkpoint. Slow down.

100
00:11:58,556 --> 00:11:59,973
No talking.

101
00:12:00,058 --> 00:12:01,808
If I give you the word, step on it.

102
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,133
This car rides pretty good.

103
00:12:35,218 --> 00:12:38,011
When I get where I'm going,
I think I'll sell it.

104
00:12:38,096 --> 00:12:39,471
Where are we going?

105
00:12:42,141 --> 00:12:45,268
Pull in to the next pump.
We'll fill up with gas and get a road map.

106
00:12:46,521 --> 00:12:48,647
I got an idea.

107
00:12:48,731 --> 00:12:50,649
A pretty good one.

108
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:12,129
[both speaking Spanish]

109
00:13:12,213 --> 00:13:13,691
- [Emmett] Speak English, you.
- I told you,

110
00:13:13,715 --> 00:13:14,965
he doesn't understand English.

111
00:13:15,049 --> 00:13:16,466
And I don't understand Mexican.

112
00:13:16,551 --> 00:13:18,802
Never mind the change,
let's get out of here.

113
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,183
Loco.

114
00:13:28,971 --> 00:13:30,221
Gimme the map.

115
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:47,280
Take the first side road we come to.

116
00:14:07,468 --> 00:14:08,760
Pull up.

117
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:14,182
Keys.

118
00:14:15,476 --> 00:14:17,769
All right, now get out like I told you.

119
00:14:23,734 --> 00:14:26,486
Here, you're the smart guy.
Spread the map out on the hood.

120
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:34,202
Get your hands up on the car.

121
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:36,329
Look for a town called Santa Rosalía.

122
00:14:40,376 --> 00:14:42,627
How far is it?

123
00:14:42,711 --> 00:14:45,171
- It's about 500 miles.
- Is it on the Gulf of California?

124
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:46,255
Yeah.

125
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,549
Say anything in there
about a ferry across the Gulf?

126
00:14:50,094 --> 00:14:51,135
Friday.

127
00:14:52,346 --> 00:14:53,513
Not bad.

128
00:14:55,224 --> 00:14:57,558
We're loaded with time.

129
00:14:57,643 --> 00:14:59,477
We can make that, easy.

130
00:15:04,316 --> 00:15:06,734
After that,
I won't be needing you guys anymore.

131
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:08,861
[gun blasts]

132
00:15:10,948 --> 00:15:12,990
Well, I guess we won't be having
rabbit for dinner.

133
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:15,702
I wasn't trying.

134
00:15:23,502 --> 00:15:26,796
Collins, put the can
out on that rock there.

135
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,885
Gimme the map.

136
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,984
Not that one! The other one.

137
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,571
That's it.

138
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,074
[Emmett laughs]

139
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,368
All right, Collins.
Put the can back on the rock.

140
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,127
Don't forget, this is loaded too.

141
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,505
Let's see you try. See how good you are.

142
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,180
Go ahead.

143
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,101
[fires rifle]

144
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,229
Not bad.

145
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,524
Collins!

146
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,151
Pick up the can.

147
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,656
Take it out on that point there.

148
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,992
If you don't, I'll let Bowen have it.

149
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,828
Out on the point, that's right.

150
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,289
Further!

151
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,379
Now hold it up.

152
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,174
You won't get hurt,
your buddy's good with guns.

153
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,593
You're crazy. I won't do it.

154
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:55,013
It's just a game. Go ahead.

155
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,057
Collins, hold it closer to you.

156
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,394
What's the matter, you scared?

157
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,605
Hold it closer.

158
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,941
You want me to try it again?
I might miss this time.

159
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,781
Shoot.

160
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,186
Come on, Gil, get going.

161
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:46,982
[fires rifle]

162
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,487
Nervous? Relax.

163
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,157
All right, Collins, come on in.

164
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,368
Fun's over.

165
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,623
You guys worked up quite a sweat.

166
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:29,941

in Florida, Detroit and Seattle

although most of these tips have been
discounted by police authorities.

At the top of the news tonight
is the report

198
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,542
that the hitchhike murderer,
Emmett Myers, is still at large.

199
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,585
Yesterday, the devil thumbed another ride

200
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,130
and William Johnson of Portland
asked him to hop in.

201

Now, William Johnson is dead.

00:20:17,318 --> 00:20:18,985
In an all-out effort to apprehend Myers,

the police have set up roadblocks

We'll camp here tonight.

220
00:21:53,767 --> 00:21:55,392
I know what you're thinking, Collins.

221
00:21:56,603 --> 00:21:58,395
You haven't got a chance.

You guys are gonna die, that's all.

No Mexican. I'm talking to you.

you pay. Is that clear?

Now one other thing.

He says their prices
are about the same as in Tijuana.

- Some beans and stuff.

And tomato soup.
I like that. Get four cans.

248

He wants four can of beans, four cans of
tomato soup, three cans of chili.

It's no use.

Well, you're not talking Mexican.

251

Take the cans off the shelves,
give them to Collins.

327
00:32:06,012 --> 00:32:09,306
They got everybody and his brother looking
for you in them mountains.

328
00:32:22,673 --> 00:32:25,466
- I told you, turn the radio on.
- I did.

329
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:28,058
It takes time to warm up.

330
00:32:30,144 --> 00:32:32,104

332

- Stop it. Stop it!
- I can't.

333
00:32:37,318 --> 00:32:38,819
I gotta pull up and disconnect it.

334
00:32:38,903 --> 00:32:39,945
Then pull up!

335
00:32:41,656 --> 00:32:43,657
[horn continues]

336
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:55,836
Go on, raise the hood.
And keep your hands on it.

337
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,297
[horn continues]

338
00:32:59,382 --> 00:33:00,799
All right, Collins, get to work.

339
00:33:01,801 --> 00:33:03,635
Get the right one the first time.

340
00:33:06,013 --> 00:33:07,973
Don't pull the radio wire!

341
00:33:08,057 --> 00:33:10,058
[horn continues]

342
00:33:16,315 --> 00:33:18,525
Faster, faster!
I thought you were a mechanic!

343
00:33:18,609 --> 00:33:21,361
I'm going as fast as I can.
The threads are frozen.

344
00:33:21,446 --> 00:33:23,238
[horn continues]

347
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,728
Come on.

348
00:33:58,775 --> 00:34:00,484
Throw the tools in the back.

349
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:18,919
The radio, remember? Make it work.

350
00:34:23,132 --> 00:34:24,716
I can't.

351
00:34:26,886 --> 00:34:28,553
Pull up.

352
00:34:30,348 --> 00:34:32,474
So you did bust it, Collins.

353
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,063
Cut it out! He didn't do it.
It's the static in the hills.

354
00:34:38,147 --> 00:34:40,148
The stations aren't strong enough
in the daytime.

355
00:34:40,233 --> 00:34:42,859
- Tonight, it'll work.
- Tonight, it better.

356
00:34:42,944 --> 00:34:44,611
Take the wheel.

357
00:34:46,906 --> 00:34:49,991
Now, in Punta Prieta,

358
00:34:50,076 --> 00:34:53,537
in August the 7th,
three Americans stopped for provisions

359
00:34:53,621 --> 00:34:56,748
at a store owned by José Andrade.

360
00:34:56,833 --> 00:35:01,127
Andrade gave an accurate description of
Myers as being one of them.

361
00:35:01,212 --> 00:35:04,714
Another witness stated
that three men came out of the store

362
00:35:04,799 --> 00:35:08,760
and drove away in a green sedan
bearing the same plate.

363
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:12,430
This confirms our theory
that Collins and Bowen are with him.

364
00:35:12,515 --> 00:35:14,683
He seems to be heading south, all right,

365
00:35:14,767 --> 00:35:16,560
staying clear of all main highways.

366
00:35:16,644 --> 00:35:20,063
Exactly. Now to the west,
this is more or less barren

367
00:35:20,147 --> 00:35:22,482
and would afford no means of escape.

368
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:27,320
His most logical move
would be Santa Rosalía.

369
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:31,032
Then Guaymas.

370
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,954
Make sure that fire's out.
Pour the coffee on it.

371
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:40,250
Get down!

372
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:52,846
I've gotta get a closer look at that car.
On your feet.

373
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,058
Through there.
At the other end, lie flat. Get going!

374
00:36:32,511 --> 00:36:33,887
Get a move on!

375
00:36:33,971 --> 00:36:35,805
What are you trying to do, wreck it?

376
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:38,058

- What did I tell you?
- Shut up!

381
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:07,733
Get that spare tire out,
and go to work. Move!

382
00:37:27,504 --> 00:37:30,131
You keep working.
Keep your traps shut, no matter what.

383
00:37:30,215 --> 00:37:31,465
I'll be watching.

00:37:47,858 --> 00:37:49,150
Do you need any help?

[both speaking Spanish]

387
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:02,913
The search for Gilbert Bowen
and Roy Collins,

388
00:38:02,998 --> 00:38:06,709
now believed to have been
last seen with Emmett Myers, mass killer,

389
00:38:06,793 --> 00:38:08,836
is being stepped up by the hour.

390
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,922
Helicopters are working in shifts,
scouring the entire area

391
00:38:12,007 --> 00:38:14,884
from El Centro south
to the Gulf of California.

392
00:38:14,968 --> 00:38:17,720
The planes are maintaining
close liaison with the ground,

393
00:38:17,804 --> 00:38:20,264
reporting isolated cars and campers.

394
00:38:20,348 --> 00:38:24,769
The Mexican police have now joined
this strange race against death.

Now, as you will notice,
when interrogated at the roadblock,

413
00:42:31,474 --> 00:42:33,934
the man and his wife
were very definite in their statement

414
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:35,936
that they only saw two men.

415
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:37,980
This was below El Arco.

416
00:42:38,064 --> 00:42:41,150
There is a point, however,
which we feel is of importance.

417
00:42:41,234 --> 00:42:44,778
The couple stated that
the behavior of the men seemed strange.

418
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,822
That they refused to talk to them.

419
00:42:46,906 --> 00:42:48,449
Of course, there's a possibility

420
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:50,743
that Myers concealed nearby,
covering the two men,

421
00:42:50,827 --> 00:42:52,411
which would account for their behavior.

422
00:42:52,495 --> 00:42:54,663
We are following through
on that possibility.

423
00:42:54,748 --> 00:42:58,417
Now, on the assumption
that Myers is listening to the car radio,

424
00:42:58,501 --> 00:43:00,627
we're issuing these broadcasts
in the States,

containing false information
as to his whereabouts

426
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:05,215
and not connecting the two men with him.

427

We'd appreciate your cooperation
in following the same procedure.

- It isn't.

- Looks like an abandoned airstrip.

Well, it's okay for tonight.

No, Roy, you're wrong, you're wrong.

It's no use, your trying
to talk me out of it.

Let's get going.

487
00:51:54,282 --> 00:51:55,908
Maybe we'll have to leave you here.

488
00:51:57,244 --> 00:51:58,244
Too bad.

489
00:52:02,999 --> 00:52:04,416
Come on, Roy, try.

490
00:53:04,561 --> 00:53:08,314
Here we are! Here we are!

491
00:53:08,398 --> 00:53:10,399
Can't you see us?

492
00:53:11,735 --> 00:53:15,070
Look! Here we are! Down here!

493
00:53:16,364 --> 00:53:19,700
Oh, please, God! Hear me!

494
00:53:19,784 --> 00:53:21,243
Hear me!

495
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:25,831
Come back! Come back. [sobs]

496
00:53:34,466 --> 00:53:37,051
Leave him alone.
Can't you see he's praying?

497
00:54:46,121 --> 00:54:48,122
[Emmett] Get under the bridge, quick!

498
00:54:55,713 --> 00:54:58,048
[car crossing bridge]

499
00:55:10,353 --> 00:55:12,104
Relax.

500
00:55:33,793 --> 00:55:35,711
Go ahead if you can stand
the filthy stuff.

501
00:55:52,395 --> 00:55:55,564
You know, Collins,
you're just about my size.

502
00:55:56,608 --> 00:55:58,859
Put you in a black shirt and dark pants...

503
00:56:00,278 --> 00:56:01,612
with a leatherjacket...

504
00:56:03,615 --> 00:56:06,450
you'd look just like Emmett Myers

505
00:56:06,534 --> 00:56:08,660
to anyone who never saw him.

506
00:56:09,829 --> 00:56:12,748
Ain't nobody in Santa Rosalía
ever saw him.

507
00:56:14,959 --> 00:56:16,835
Let's change.

508
00:56:19,672 --> 00:56:20,923
[cocks gun]

509
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:24,676
Get up on the bank,
and take your clothes off.

510
00:56:45,031 --> 00:56:46,907
Come on, get up!

511
00:57:24,779 --> 00:57:27,030
[shouting in Spanish]

512
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,774
- Looks great, doesn't it?
- You won't be there long.

513
00:58:04,858 --> 00:58:07,151
Collins! There are cops down there.

514
00:58:07,235 --> 00:58:09,654
In those clothes, they might shoot you.

515
00:58:09,738 --> 00:58:12,573
That'd solve all your problems,
wouldn't it?

516
00:58:12,658 --> 00:58:15,910
Not if they found they'd made a mistake,
it wouldn't.

517
00:58:15,994 --> 00:58:18,245
We'll hit some little joint
on the outskirts.

518
00:58:19,164 --> 00:58:21,415
I might even buy you boys a beer.

519
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,042
Get moving.

520
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:32,968
[speaking Spanish]

521
00:58:33,053 --> 00:58:34,261
Give us three beers.

522
00:58:35,263 --> 00:58:37,223
[speaks Spanish]

523
00:58:38,767 --> 00:58:40,518
He doesn't speak English.

524
00:58:40,602 --> 00:58:43,312
[both speak Spanish]

525
00:58:43,397 --> 00:58:46,357
When I want you to talk Mex,
I'll tell you.

526
00:58:46,441 --> 00:58:49,193
Sit down, Collins. Rest your sore foot.

527
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:56,826
You can talk it now.
Ask him about the ferry to Guaymas.

528
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:58,661
I'll be watching his face.

529
00:58:58,745 --> 00:59:01,372
If he starts looks frightened,
I start shootin'.

530
00:59:03,125 --> 00:59:09,839
[both speaking Spanish]

531
00:59:09,923 --> 00:59:12,925
[Gilbert] Friday, that's today,
and Tuesday, at 9:00.

532
00:59:13,009 --> 00:59:16,095
- Ask him where we catch it.
- [Gilbert speaks Spanish]

534
00:59:24,896 --> 00:59:26,814
You're out of luck.

535
00:59:26,898 --> 00:59:29,442
The ferry burned up.
It's being repaired in Guaymas.

536
00:59:31,111 --> 00:59:33,279
[Emmett] You're lying.

537
00:59:33,363 --> 00:59:35,531
Ask if he knows anyone speaks English.

538

[speaking Spanish]

540
00:59:46,334 --> 00:59:48,919
He says he has
a cousin who speaks English, follow him.

541
00:59:49,004 --> 00:59:50,296
Up.

542
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:54,091
José! [speaks Spanish]

543
00:59:56,178 --> 00:59:58,262
José, José. [speaks Spanish]

544
00:59:58,346 --> 01:00:01,223
[both speaking Spanish]

[speaking Spanish]

546
01:00:12,027 --> 01:00:14,445
What can I do for you?

547
01:00:14,529 --> 01:00:16,822
We wanna find out
about the ferry to Guaymas.

548
01:00:16,907 --> 01:00:18,532
You wanna go fishing?

549
01:00:19,868 --> 01:00:23,662
Too bad. No ferry anymore
for the next two months, maybe.

550
01:00:23,747 --> 01:00:26,081
- She burned up.
- Thank you.

551
01:00:26,166 --> 01:00:31,378
Fishing is pretty good here. Not as good
as Guaymas or La Paz, but okay.

552
01:00:31,463 --> 01:00:34,757
- [José] You have motorboat?
- [Emmett] You know someone who has a boat?

553
01:00:34,841 --> 01:00:40,012
Sure, sure. My friend Jaime, he have one.
Motor runs good.

554
01:00:40,096 --> 01:00:42,973
- How do we get to this Jaime?
- [José] In the mine, where he works.

555
01:00:43,058 --> 01:00:45,851
- Let's go.
- He's not finished until 6:00.

556
01:00:45,936 --> 01:00:49,021
- I'll fix it for you tomorrow morning.
- I wanna go now.

557
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:51,982
At 6:00, then.

558
01:00:52,067 --> 01:00:54,360
By the time my friend gets the boat ready,

559
01:00:54,444 --> 01:00:56,237
there is no sun.

560
01:00:58,031 --> 01:01:01,242
My friend does not like
using too much boat at night.

561
01:01:03,245 --> 01:01:06,664
He... He sees his wife and kids

562
01:01:06,748 --> 01:01:08,874
- only at night.
- [Emmett] Give him some more.

563
01:01:09,793 --> 01:01:11,460
- For me?
- Yeah.

564
01:01:11,545 --> 01:01:13,754
- You pay my friend too?
- Yeah.

565
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:18,342
You be at pier at 8:30.
The name of the boat is Estrella.

566
01:01:20,929 --> 01:01:22,805
A thousand thanks, señor.

567
01:01:25,016 --> 01:01:26,350
Good.

568
01:01:28,061 --> 01:01:31,105
We'll go 'round to town
and wait by the water till it gets dark.

569
01:01:31,189 --> 01:01:32,690
Let's go.

570
01:02:09,542 --> 01:02:11,794
Hold it a minute, will you?

571
01:02:11,878 --> 01:02:13,128
Hang on.

572
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:43,367
Better go fishing
while you've got a chance.

573
01:02:43,451 --> 01:02:45,786
That's what you
came down here for, wasn't it?

574
01:02:48,373 --> 01:02:50,624
You guys are really fools.

575
01:02:52,293 --> 01:02:54,461
If you weren't, one of you
would have got away.

576
01:02:56,047 --> 01:02:59,675
But you kept thinking about each other.
So you missed some chances.

577
01:03:01,136 --> 01:03:04,638
You got tired. You slowed down.

578
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:07,599
Now it's pretty late.

579
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:11,437
Yeah, tomorrow I'll be in Guaymas.

580
01:03:12,731 --> 01:03:15,858
Too bad you're not making
the whole trip with me.

581
01:03:15,942 --> 01:03:18,402
[laughs]
That'd be kinda silly, wouldn't it?

582
01:03:24,993 --> 01:03:27,536
You stink, Myers!

583
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:30,956
You smell. Just like your clothes.

584
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:33,542
Sure, you'll make it to Guaymas,

585
01:03:33,626 --> 01:03:38,213
but they'll catch up with you
and put you out of your misery.

586
01:03:38,298 --> 01:03:42,801
You haven't got a chance.
You haven't got a thing except that gun.

587
01:03:42,886 --> 01:03:44,636
You'd better hang on to it,

588
01:03:44,721 --> 01:03:47,056
because without it, you're nothing.

589
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:49,641
- You're finished!
- Shut up!

590
01:03:53,521 --> 01:03:55,564
Gracias, Carlos.

591

All right, Collins.

598
01:05:08,556 --> 01:05:11,641
Now you get to take
a nice little walk all by yourself.

599
01:05:11,726 --> 01:05:15,353
Down the alley and out on the dock.
Me and Bowen will follow.

600
01:05:15,438 --> 01:05:18,273
If you try to tip anyone off,
I'll let Bowen have it.

601
01:05:18,357 --> 01:05:21,818
You wouldn't want that
to happen, would you? Get going.

All the way out. Keep under the lights.
