Is Tommy taking you to the school prom?

He hasn't asked me yet.

He will.

someone as nice as Tommy.

# It's never happened #

89
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:10,559
# To me #

90
00:05:12,314 --> 00:05:14,921
# Then one day #

91
00:05:14,922 --> 00:05:19,922
# All of a sudden #

92
00:05:20,193 --> 00:05:22,577
# My true love #

93
00:05:22,578 --> 00:05:27,578

94
00:05:27,674 --> 00:05:32,668

95
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:37,669
# Was here to stay #

96
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:46,899

# He came along #

100
00:05:57,956 --> 00:06:01,649
# My life's a song #

101
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,753

103
00:06:07,853 --> 00:06:12,146

Well, that's how I feel.

109
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,905
Oh, I wish I was in love.

110
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:49,489
I mean, I wish someone
was in love with me.

111
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:53,840
Anyway, you better keep an eye on Tommy.

112
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:56,067
That new girl, Gloria, asked me who he was

113
00:06:56,068 --> 00:06:59,176
when he said hello to me in
the school corridor today,

114
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:02,089
and she's a girl who when
she makes up here mind

115
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,898
to get something...

116
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:05,316
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

117
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:07,749
- Hi.
- Hi, Tommy.

118
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,892
Well, I have to go.

119
00:07:10,893 --> 00:07:14,361
I have to take care of my kid sister.

120
00:07:14,362 --> 00:07:18,029
Remember what I told
you about you know who.

121
00:07:21,238 --> 00:07:23,388
The school paper's got
these announcements today.

122
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:24,972
Have you seen them?

123
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,100
Are you going to enter it?

124
00:07:33,101 --> 00:07:35,172
Why don't you enter, too?

125
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:36,840
Oh, I'd never win.

126
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:38,978
I think you would.

127
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:40,622
Hello, Dori.

128
00:07:40,623 --> 00:07:41,956
Hello, Gloria.

129
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,189
Oh, Gloria, this is Tommy.

130
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,492
Tommy, Gloria.

131
00:07:52,493 --> 00:07:53,587
Hi, Gloria.

132
00:07:53,588 --> 00:07:55,226
Hello, Tommy.

133
00:07:55,227 --> 00:07:56,727
Ah, see you later.

134
00:08:01,578 --> 00:08:03,038
Who's she?

135
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,244
Her name's Gloria Barker.

136
00:08:05,245 --> 00:08:06,745
She's new in town.

137
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:11,236
Well, I have to go now.

138
00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:14,194
Aren't you going to walk me home?

139
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:15,112
Oh, sure.

140
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:20,396
Say, I almost forget to tell ya.

141
00:08:20,397 --> 00:08:22,179
Be sure and watch Alan
Freed's television program

142
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,242
tomorrow night.

143
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:24,554
I never miss it.

144
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:26,315
What's going to be on tomorrow night?

145
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:27,827
A surprise.

146
00:08:27,828 --> 00:08:29,672
What kind of a surprise?

147
00:08:29,673 --> 00:08:30,995
Just watch it and see.

148
00:08:30,996 --> 00:08:33,229
I'll ask Arabella to come over my house.

149
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,063
We'll see it together.

150
00:08:35,953 --> 00:08:37,172
Hello, Gloria.

151
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:39,384
God, what a day I've had.

152
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,738
I went to the dress shop this morning

153
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:43,922
to order a new evening
dress for the dance.

154
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,622
You're going to wear an
evening dress to the dance?

155
00:08:46,623 --> 00:08:49,540
Strapless, blue, strapless, blue.

156
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:54,919
A friend of yours told
me it his favorite color.

157
00:08:56,397 --> 00:08:57,564
Well, so long.

158
00:09:01,762 --> 00:09:04,595
Gosh, if she's going to get one,

159
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:08,113
I'm going to get one, too.

160
00:09:09,193 --> 00:09:11,409
I think you oughta have one.

161
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,989
I think you oughta have all
the things your heart needs,

162
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,343
and I wish I could give them to ya.

163
00:09:18,344 --> 00:09:21,761
(atmospheric rock music)

164
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:34,306
# I can't give ya diamonds #

165
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:38,112
# And I can't give ya pearls #

166
00:09:38,113 --> 00:09:40,902
# I can't give ya palaces #

167
00:09:40,903 --> 00:09:43,663
# With princes, dukes and earls #

168
00:09:43,664 --> 00:09:48,664
# But when it comes to love #

169
00:09:49,312 --> 00:09:54,312
# You'll have the things
your heart needs #

170
00:09:56,068 --> 00:10:01,043
# You'll lips who kiss you sweetly #

171
00:10:01,044 --> 00:10:04,841

# Each morning, noon and night #

174
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:15,590
# For when it comes to love #

175
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:21,067
# You'll have the things you heart needs #

176
00:10:23,325 --> 00:10:26,609
# Ooh, I can't give you #

177
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,615
# Satins or sables #

178
00:10:30,616 --> 00:10:35,616
# Or things that you may
have been dreaming of #

179
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:41,215
# But baby what good are those satins #

180
00:10:41,216 --> 00:10:43,900
# And those sables #

181
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:46,291
# Unless #

182
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:51,292

00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:58,745
# A love that's just for you #

185

# Tenderness and kindness #

186
00:11:01,576 --> 00:11:04,599

00:11:12,874 --> 00:11:14,834
# You'll have the things #

190
00:11:14,835 --> 00:11:17,752
# Your heart needs #

191
00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:26,405
(birds chirping)

192
00:11:29,727 --> 00:11:32,727
(telephone ringing)

193
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:42,334
Hello?

194
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:44,201
It's for me.

195
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:46,837
Hello, Arabella.

196
00:11:48,215 --> 00:11:50,904
What are you doing this
beautiful Saturday afternoon?

197
00:11:50,905 --> 00:11:52,312
My mother's going shopping,

198
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:55,351
and I have to take care
of my little sister,

199
00:11:55,352 --> 00:11:57,176
so I'm taking her to the movies.

200
00:11:57,177 --> 00:11:58,487
You wanna go?

201
00:11:58,488 --> 00:12:00,872
Gosh, I'd like to, but

202
00:12:00,873 --> 00:12:04,767
I haven't got any M-O-N-E-Y.

203
00:12:04,768 --> 00:12:06,001
[Arabella] What?

204
00:12:06,002 --> 00:12:08,778
I used up my allowance for this week.

205
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:13,494
Oh, and I only have enough
for me and the B-R-A-T.

206
00:12:13,495 --> 00:12:14,328
Mm, ow.

207
00:12:15,954 --> 00:12:17,562
I tell ya what,

208
00:12:17,563 --> 00:12:18,974
I'll meet you on the terrace

209
00:12:18,975 --> 00:12:21,041
at the country club in half an hour.

210
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:22,959
I have a plan, goodbye.

211
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:30,073
Father, give me a dollar, quick.

212
00:12:30,074 --> 00:12:31,348
I have to go somewhere.

213
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:33,786
Okay, where do you have to go?

214
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,780
- To the movies.
- Oh.

215
00:12:35,781 --> 00:12:38,440
Just a minute, young lady.

216
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:40,447
Stay right there.

217
00:12:40,448 --> 00:12:41,635
You mean to say you haven't

218
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,822
any money left from your allowance?

219
00:12:43,823 --> 00:12:45,837
I didn't mean to tell you.

220
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:47,430
I just found out anyway.

221
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:49,560
I thought you were gonna keep a budget?

222
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:52,714
I did, but it didn't stay kept.

223
00:12:52,715 --> 00:12:53,965
May I see it?

224
00:12:58,726 --> 00:13:00,976
Uh-huh, ice cream, candy,

225
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,626
magazines, jukebox, forty cents,

226
00:13:07,942 --> 00:13:09,442
E.P., sixty cents.

227
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,206
E.P., what's that?

228
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:13,956
Elvis Presley.

229
00:13:13,957 --> 00:13:16,368
I still say, what's that?

230
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:18,202
Father, you're sweet

231
00:13:19,455 --> 00:13:20,622
but so square.

232
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,846
I played Elvis Presley
records on the jukebox.

233
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,322
You already have an item down here

234
00:13:26,323 --> 00:13:27,447
for playing the jukebox.

235
00:13:27,448 --> 00:13:29,138
Why don't you put 'em both together?

236
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:31,436
Oh, it would look like
I spent too much money

237
00:13:31,437 --> 00:13:33,020
for just one thing.

238
00:13:33,888 --> 00:13:35,857
That is dishonest.

239
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:40,349
Why, why in business, that's
like keeping two sets of books.

240
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,529
Is that bad?

241
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,572
Bad, it's illegal.

242
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:45,142
They put men in jail for that.

243
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:48,726
Oh, well, I have to
go meet Arabella now.

244
00:13:49,978 --> 00:13:51,164
Thanks for the movie money.

245
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:52,903
Ah, you're welcome.

246
00:13:52,904 --> 00:13:53,744
Now wait a minute.

247
00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:56,327
Wait a minute, I didn't give...

248
00:13:57,287 --> 00:13:58,120
Louise?

249
00:13:59,324 --> 00:14:00,157
Louise?

250
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,017
What's the matter?

251
00:14:06,018 --> 00:14:07,841
It's that daughter of yours.

252
00:14:07,842 --> 00:14:10,199
Louise, there hasn't been one week

253
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,655
that she hasn't run out of her allowance.

254
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:16,385
She has no idea of the value of money.

255
00:14:16,386 --> 00:14:18,469
Look at this, look, wait.

256
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:22,822
Look, bills, bills, nothing but bills.

257
00:14:22,823 --> 00:14:24,770
Bills for clothes, bills for hats,

258
00:14:24,771 --> 00:14:27,173
bills for all sorts of things.

259
00:14:27,174 --> 00:14:29,020
Louise, we've gotta teach that girl

260
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:32,047
that money doesn't grow on fathers.

261
00:14:32,048 --> 00:14:34,623
Now, first thing Monday morning,

262
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,054
I'm gonna go right down,

263
00:14:36,055 --> 00:14:40,434
and cancel everyone of
our charge accounts.

264
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:43,353
But supposing she
needs some new clothes?

265
00:14:43,354 --> 00:14:46,937
Nope, Dori's not
gonna get one new thing.

266
00:14:49,015 --> 00:14:51,765
(birds chirping)

267
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:57,048
- Hi.
- Hi, Dori.

268
00:14:57,049 --> 00:14:57,882
Hi, baby.

269
00:14:57,883 --> 00:14:58,888
Hello.

270
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:00,071
Where you waiting long?

271
00:15:00,072 --> 00:15:01,598
Just a few minutes.

272
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:02,979
Ready to go?

273
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,897
I am, but this one...

274
00:15:05,765 --> 00:15:07,477
Don't you wanna go to the movies?

275
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:08,534
No.

276
00:15:08,535 --> 00:15:09,659
You wanna a little doll?

277
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,493
- No.
- Don't you want

278
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:11,773
a storybook?
No.

279
00:15:11,774 --> 00:15:13,429
- Do you want blocks?
- No.

280
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,733
Well then, what do you want?

281
00:15:15,734 --> 00:15:18,693
I know what she wants, come on.

282
00:15:18,694 --> 00:15:21,694
(upbeat rock music)

283
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,123
# Don't want a dolly #

284
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,310
# A storybook or blocks #

285
00:15:26,311 --> 00:15:29,410
# Baby's only happy #

286
00:15:29,411 --> 00:15:32,494
# Oh, when she rocks #

287
00:15:33,761 --> 00:15:35,575
# Baby wants to rock #
# Rock #

288
00:15:35,576 --> 00:15:37,457

# Roll #

289
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,702
# Baby wants to tap #

290
00:15:38,703 --> 00:15:40,922
# Well bless my soul #

291
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:42,803
# Baby wants to dance #
# Dance #

292
00:15:42,804 --> 00:15:44,743
# Dance from head to toe #
# Go #

293
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:48,185
# Baby wants to rock #
# And go, go, go #

294
00:15:48,186 --> 00:15:50,068

Alan Freed's Rock'n Roll Party.

And here he is in person, Alan Freed.

330

(crowd applauding)

331
00:17:34,996 --> 00:17:36,317

00:28:25,202 --> 00:28:27,699
# Would I #

491
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:32,700
# Be crying #

492
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:38,299
# If I were lying #

493
00:28:39,649 --> 00:28:41,910
# To #

494
00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:46,142
# You #
# Ooh #

495
00:28:46,143 --> 00:28:49,143
(audience cheering)

496
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:53,963
Now, nail down the roof, gang

497
00:28:53,964 --> 00:28:57,042
because here's a new act
that can blow it right off.

498
00:28:57,043 --> 00:28:59,483
The sensational Jimmy
Cavallo and his House Rockers

499
00:28:59,484 --> 00:29:01,588
and The Big Beat.

500
00:29:01,589 --> 00:29:04,589
(upbeat rock music)

501
00:29:15,935 --> 00:29:18,394
# They used to dance to
the two-step and tango #

502
00:29:18,395 --> 00:29:20,798
# And hopty-hopped to the Dixieland #

503
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,864
# Now they dance to rock'n roll #

504
00:29:22,865 --> 00:29:25,544
# To big, big beat of a rockin' band #

505
00:29:25,545 --> 00:29:27,703
# Everybody dancin' to the big beat #

506
00:29:27,704 --> 00:29:30,144
# Everybody dancin' to the big beat #

507
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:32,404
# All across the nation
from coast to coast #

508
00:29:32,405 --> 00:29:34,802
# In true syncopation
and here's how it goes #

509
00:29:34,803 --> 00:29:37,308
# Rock, roll, go #

510
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:39,560
# Everybody dance to the big beat #

511
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:41,827
# They used to sing to wide open spaces #

512
00:29:41,828 --> 00:29:44,364
# They used to groove so soft and sweet #

513
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,771
# But now to be real up to date #

514
00:29:46,772 --> 00:29:49,136
# You shout it out with a big, big, beat #

515
00:29:49,137 --> 00:29:51,809
# Everybody's singin' to the big beat #

516
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,890
# Everybody's singing' to the big beat #

517
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:56,263
# All across the nation
from coast to coast #

518
00:29:56,264 --> 00:29:58,618
# In true syncopation
and here's how it goes #

519
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:01,641
# Rock, roll, go, blow #

520
00:30:01,642 --> 00:30:04,392
(saxophone solo)

521
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:33,602
# They use to try to put
jazz on the trumpet #

522
00:30:33,603 --> 00:30:36,073
# A fine brunette would sing them songs #

523
00:30:36,074 --> 00:30:38,423
# Now they shout for the tenor sax #

524
00:30:38,424 --> 00:30:40,821
# They all give up with go man go #

525
00:30:40,822 --> 00:30:43,187
# Everybody's shoutin' for the big beat #

526
00:30:43,188 --> 00:30:45,493
# Everybody's shoutin' for the big beat #

527
00:30:45,494 --> 00:30:47,807
# All across the nation
from coast to coast #

528
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:50,163
# In true syncopation
and here's how it goes #

529
00:30:50,164 --> 00:30:52,758
# Rock, roll, go #

530
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:55,066
# Everybody's shoutin',
Everybody's singin' #

531
00:30:55,067 --> 00:30:56,030
# Everybody's dancin' #

532
00:30:56,031 --> 00:31:00,548
# To the big, big, big, beat #

533
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:03,549
(audience cheering)

534
00:31:12,219 --> 00:31:14,325
And now, here's that crucial moment

535
00:31:14,326 --> 00:31:16,916
that we wait for every week.

536
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:21,372
The winner of our Rock'n Roll
Talent Contest for this week.

537
00:31:21,373 --> 00:31:23,872
A wonderful young man
who sings a great song,

538
00:31:23,873 --> 00:31:25,674
and you'll be hearing plenty about him.

539
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,258
Tommy Rogers and Thanks To You.

540
00:31:31,227 --> 00:31:33,041
# Thanks #

541
00:31:33,042 --> 00:31:37,792
# To you #
# Doo, doo, doo #

542
00:31:38,825 --> 00:31:41,908
# I've begun to live #

543
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:50,071
# Thanks to you #
# Doo, doo, doo #

544
00:31:50,292 --> 00:31:55,292
# Now it's fun to live #

545
00:31:55,856 --> 00:32:00,476
# I never knew that life #

546
00:32:00,477 --> 00:32:05,477
# Could be such a glorious story #

547
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:11,702
# Until you came my way #

548
00:32:11,703 --> 00:32:14,849
# And put the glow #

549
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,100
# In glory #

550
00:32:18,156 --> 00:32:23,156
# What a thrill #
# Doo, doo, doo #

551
00:32:24,024 --> 00:32:29,024
# Sharing love with you #
# Doo, doo, doo #

552
00:32:30,518 --> 00:32:35,518
# Now I know #
# Doo, doo, doo #

553
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:40,662
# What true love can do #

554
00:32:41,258 --> 00:32:46,258
# My life was once a wilderness #

555
00:32:46,387 --> 00:32:51,387
# The way I was lonely and blue #

556
00:32:53,293 --> 00:32:58,293
# Now I found true happiness #

557
00:32:59,443 --> 00:33:04,310
# Thanks to you #

558
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:09,311
# My life was once a wilderness #

559
00:33:09,522 --> 00:33:14,522
# The way I was lonely and blue #

560
00:33:15,762 --> 00:33:20,762
# But I found true happiness #

561
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:25,278
# Thanks to you #

562
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:31,541
(audience cheering)

563
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,251
I bet I know what you're thinking.

564
00:33:35,252 --> 00:33:38,609
Hmm, now that he's won the contest...

565
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:42,066
That Gloria will want
him more than ever.

566
00:33:42,067 --> 00:33:45,557
And she's going to wear an
evening dress to the dance.

567
00:33:45,558 --> 00:33:47,475
A blue evening dress.

568
00:33:48,332 --> 00:33:50,474
And strapless.

569
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:52,485
There's just one thing to do.

570
00:33:52,486 --> 00:33:57,403
I'll go down to the dress
shop tomorrow and get one, too.

571
00:34:04,532 --> 00:34:06,279
But please, Miss Silky.

572
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,657
Now girls, you'll just have to wait,

573
00:34:07,658 --> 00:34:09,585
and I'll take care of you one at a time.

574
00:34:09,586 --> 00:34:11,717
I have a customer in the
fitting room right now,

575
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:15,179
and I'll be out as soon
as I'm finished with her.

576
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,097
Come along.

577
00:34:17,293 --> 00:34:18,747
You're next, aren't you?

578
00:34:18,748 --> 00:34:20,081
[Dori] Uh-huh.

579
00:34:22,784 --> 00:34:24,857
It seems like everybody
wants an evening dress

580
00:34:24,858 --> 00:34:28,284
since they know that Gloria
was going to get one.

581
00:34:28,285 --> 00:34:31,769
Ah, I wish I had someone to
wear an evening dress for.

582
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,889
Oh, you'll meet him someday.

583
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:36,587
Just like that, you'll see.

584
00:34:36,588 --> 00:34:38,304
I don't know.

585
00:34:38,305 --> 00:34:41,472
Sometimes I think I'll never meet him.

586
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:56,071
Pardon me, could you tell
me where the proprietress is?

587
00:34:56,072 --> 00:34:58,322
Miss Silky's in the back.

588
00:35:01,503 --> 00:35:02,985
That's him.

589
00:35:02,986 --> 00:35:04,468
I know that's him.

590
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:05,672
Who?

591
00:35:05,673 --> 00:35:07,454
My dream man.

592
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:09,305
His name is Melville.

593
00:35:09,306 --> 00:35:10,646
Melville.

594
00:35:10,647 --> 00:35:12,377
He's in my French class.

595
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:14,306
- He is?
- Uh-huh.

596
00:35:14,307 --> 00:35:16,640
And I had to take Spanish.

597
00:35:20,855 --> 00:35:23,450
Oh, Melville, I'd like
you to meet Arabella.

598
00:35:23,451 --> 00:35:25,289
Arabella, Melville.

599
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,123
Pleased to meet you.

600
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,516
Why didn't you say something?

601
00:35:31,517 --> 00:35:32,934
He's beautiful.

602
00:35:34,342 --> 00:35:36,440
Now Dori, what can I do for you?

603
00:35:36,441 --> 00:35:38,107
I'd like to get an evening dress.

604
00:35:38,108 --> 00:35:40,509
There's a nice one in
the window for $30.00.

605
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,473
The blue one.

606
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:43,457
And are you going to pay for it now?

607
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:47,972
Why, no, I'm going to
charge it like I always do.

608
00:35:47,973 --> 00:35:49,728
And haven't you heard?

609
00:35:49,729 --> 00:35:50,630
What?

610
00:35:50,631 --> 00:35:53,379
Your father closed your
charge account this morning.

611
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,721
He did?

612
00:35:54,722 --> 00:35:55,722
I'm sorry.

613
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,153
Gosh.

614
00:36:10,643 --> 00:36:11,937
Are the dishes done already?

615
00:36:11,938 --> 00:36:13,438
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

616
00:36:16,948 --> 00:36:18,946
Dori helped me.

617
00:36:18,947 --> 00:36:20,603
Dori did?

618
00:36:20,604 --> 00:36:22,051
That's strange.

619
00:36:22,052 --> 00:36:24,357
I thought so, too.

620
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:26,221
She's taking an awfully long time.

621
00:36:26,222 --> 00:36:28,722
I hope she's doing them right.

622
00:36:30,068 --> 00:36:32,068
Dori doing the dishes?

623
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:49,916
Comfy?

624
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:51,793
Oh, sure.

625
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,641
Dori?

626
00:36:57,642 --> 00:36:59,114
Yes, Father?

627
00:36:59,115 --> 00:37:01,843
Is there something on your mind?

628
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:04,511
As a matter of fact, there is.

629
00:37:06,262 --> 00:37:09,713
You see, Father, I went
to the dress shop today,

630
00:37:09,714 --> 00:37:11,502
and Miss Silky told me that we didn't have

631
00:37:11,503 --> 00:37:14,420
a charge account there anymore and,

632
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:20,221
well I've just have to get an
evening dress for the prom.

633
00:37:20,222 --> 00:37:22,453
An evening dress, huh?

634
00:37:22,454 --> 00:37:26,287
I saw a beautiful one
there for only $30.00.

635
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:28,525
Only $30.00?

636
00:37:29,722 --> 00:37:31,401
Do you realize, young lady,

637
00:37:31,402 --> 00:37:34,962
how difficult it is to earn $30.00?

638
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:38,380
I know, but I need this dress so badly.

639
00:37:40,238 --> 00:37:43,556
Well, when is this dance of yours?

640
00:37:43,557 --> 00:37:45,643
Two weeks from Saturday.

641
00:37:45,644 --> 00:37:48,201
When's the latest you
can order the dress?

642
00:37:48,202 --> 00:37:51,952
Oh, about three days
before the dance, why?

643
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:56,395
Well, I'll tell ya what
I'm gonna do with ya.

644
00:37:56,396 --> 00:37:58,710
Now the dress is $30.00, huh?

645
00:37:58,711 --> 00:38:00,878
Alright, I'll give $15.00,

646
00:38:02,972 --> 00:38:05,257
if you earn the other 15.

647
00:38:05,258 --> 00:38:06,501
Oh.

648
00:38:06,502 --> 00:38:09,850
Maybe when you find out how
difficult it is to earn money,

649
00:38:09,851 --> 00:38:13,672
then you'll spend it a little less freely.

650
00:38:13,673 --> 00:38:16,423
Where am I going to get $15.00?

651
00:38:19,158 --> 00:38:21,908
(birds chirping)

652
00:38:29,822 --> 00:38:32,325
Well, Dori Graham, how are you?

653
00:38:32,326 --> 00:38:34,434
Very well, thank you, Mr. Bimble.

654
00:38:34,435 --> 00:38:35,685
Ah, sit down.

655
00:38:37,391 --> 00:38:39,986
Well now Dori, how can I help you?

656
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:41,654
I'd like to borrow some money.

657
00:38:41,655 --> 00:38:42,814
What?

658
00:38:42,815 --> 00:38:44,731
Well, isn't that what banks are for?

659
00:38:44,732 --> 00:38:47,482
Well, yes, true, but we don't lend money

660
00:38:47,483 --> 00:38:50,724
without business references, collateral.

661
00:38:50,725 --> 00:38:52,882
What's collateral?

662
00:38:52,883 --> 00:38:55,955
Collateral, well that's
something that people pledge

663
00:38:55,956 --> 00:38:58,846
that's worth as much as the
amount of money we lend them.

664
00:38:58,847 --> 00:39:00,954
When someone puts money in your bank,

665
00:39:00,955 --> 00:39:02,665
what do you do with it?

666
00:39:02,666 --> 00:39:05,434
Well, I don't really know.

667
00:39:05,435 --> 00:39:07,692
You mean to tell me, Mr. Bimble,

668
00:39:07,693 --> 00:39:09,521
that you take people's money

669
00:39:09,522 --> 00:39:11,128
and don't know what you do with it?

670
00:39:11,129 --> 00:39:12,947
Well, of course I
know what we do with it.

671
00:39:12,948 --> 00:39:15,187
What I mean there is that I don't know

672
00:39:15,188 --> 00:39:18,784
where any particular deposit goes.

673
00:39:18,785 --> 00:39:20,602
You mean, the deposits are all mixed up?

674
00:39:20,603 --> 00:39:22,097
No, no, no.

675
00:39:22,098 --> 00:39:23,831
They're kept in order by bookkeeping.

676
00:39:23,832 --> 00:39:25,574
Double-entry bookkeeping.

677
00:39:25,575 --> 00:39:28,150
You keep two sets of books?

678
00:39:28,151 --> 00:39:30,651
I do not keep two sets, I...

679
00:39:31,993 --> 00:39:33,244
Oh, Dori Graham, let...

680
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:35,784
When depositors put money in your bank,

681
00:39:35,785 --> 00:39:38,523
where do you get the
money to pay in interest?

682
00:39:38,524 --> 00:39:40,221
Well, ah, the bank makes its money

683
00:39:40,222 --> 00:39:45,055
by giving loans to responsible
people who have collateral,

684
00:39:46,225 --> 00:39:49,330
and charging interest on the loans.

685
00:39:49,331 --> 00:39:51,294
How much interest do you charge?

686
00:39:51,295 --> 00:39:52,128
6%.

687
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:56,060
That's awfully high, isn't it?

688
00:39:58,445 --> 00:40:01,028
6% interest is standard.

689
00:40:02,225 --> 00:40:03,392
- It is?
- Yes.

690
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,550
Seems awfully high to me.

691
00:40:09,043 --> 00:40:12,300
Suppose some person came along,

692
00:40:12,301 --> 00:40:15,468
and charged less interest than you do.

693
00:40:16,605 --> 00:40:18,011
Well, I'd bet pretty soon,

694
00:40:18,012 --> 00:40:22,444
they'd take all your business
away from you, wouldn't he?

695
00:40:22,445 --> 00:40:25,663
Mr. Bimble, you've given me something

696
00:40:25,664 --> 00:40:28,164
more valuable than money.

697
00:40:28,165 --> 00:40:30,276
You've given me knowledge.

698
00:40:30,277 --> 00:40:32,110
Thank you, Mr. Bimble.

699
00:40:36,379 --> 00:40:39,129
(birds chirping)

700
00:40:47,897 --> 00:40:51,814
Arabella, how would you
like to be wallowing...

701
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:57,433
Arabella, how would you like
to be wallowing in money?

702
00:40:57,434 --> 00:40:58,543
Huh?

703
00:40:58,544 --> 00:41:00,378
I just thought of the most wonderful way

704
00:41:00,379 --> 00:41:02,674
to make money to pay for my evening dress.

705
00:41:02,675 --> 00:41:04,522
I'm going to be a banker.

706
00:41:04,523 --> 00:41:05,356
You?

707
00:41:05,357 --> 00:41:09,081
Sure, I'm going to lend
money and get interest on it.

708
00:41:09,082 --> 00:41:10,435
Where will you get the money?

709
00:41:10,436 --> 00:41:12,593
That's where you can help me.

710
00:41:12,594 --> 00:41:15,485
All I've got in the world is $15.00,

711
00:41:15,486 --> 00:41:17,147
and that's in Mr. Bimble's bank.

712
00:41:17,148 --> 00:41:19,265
Oh, but that's terrible.

713
00:41:19,266 --> 00:41:21,631
You'll have to get it out right away.

714
00:41:21,632 --> 00:41:23,132
They're dishonest.

715
00:41:24,797 --> 00:41:26,528
How do ya know?

716
00:41:26,529 --> 00:41:29,190
They keep two sets of books

717
00:41:29,191 --> 00:41:31,499
and that's a government offense.

718
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,513
My father told me so.

719
00:41:33,514 --> 00:41:35,214
Why they can close the bank any minute,

720
00:41:35,215 --> 00:41:37,910
and take them all off to jail.

721
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:41,457
Gosh, I'd better get my money out.

722
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,328
Then you can put it in my bank.

723
00:41:43,329 --> 00:41:45,837
Oh, it will earn scads of interest.

724
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:47,464
Now, you go down and get your money

725
00:41:47,465 --> 00:41:50,034
out of Mr. Bimble's bank right away.

726
00:41:50,035 --> 00:41:51,953
But I have to go to class.

727
00:41:51,954 --> 00:41:55,388
Which would you rather
be, ignorant or bankrupt?

728
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:56,677
That's a good question.

729
00:41:56,678 --> 00:41:57,511
C'mon.

730
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:03,810
(upbeat rock music)

731
00:42:19,922 --> 00:42:21,511
What's the matter?

732
00:42:21,512 --> 00:42:23,146
Oh, it's nothing.

733
00:42:23,147 --> 00:42:25,340
I saw Melville again.

734
00:42:25,341 --> 00:42:26,533
He spoke to me.

735
00:42:26,534 --> 00:42:27,788
And?

736
00:42:27,789 --> 00:42:31,399
I couldn't think of
anything to say back.

737
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,132
Well if he spoke to you,
he must be interested.

738
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:38,081
Maybe next time you'll
think of something to say.

739
00:42:38,082 --> 00:42:39,499
I sure hope so.

740
00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:43,574
Hey, kids, listen to me.

741
00:42:43,575 --> 00:42:44,977
Knock it off.

742
00:42:44,978 --> 00:42:47,061
Phil, go get the jukebox.

743
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:55,018
I got great news for ya.

744
00:42:55,019 --> 00:42:56,162
After the television show,

745
00:42:56,163 --> 00:42:59,385
I asked Alan Freed if he'd
come down to our prom.

746
00:42:59,386 --> 00:43:00,736
I just talked to Alan on the phone,

747
00:43:00,737 --> 00:43:02,603
he's comin' and he's bring a whole show.

748
00:43:02,604 --> 00:43:05,354
(crowd cheering)

749
00:43:06,689 --> 00:43:09,106
So, we're gonna rock tonight.

750
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:15,420
# Gonna rock #

751
00:43:15,421 --> 00:43:16,753
# Gonna rock #

752
00:43:16,754 --> 00:43:19,488
# Gonna rock, rock, rock, rock, rock #

753
00:43:19,489 --> 00:43:22,242
# Gonna call for my baby

754
00:43:22,243 --> 00:43:24,736
# And be there on time
'cause it never starts late #

755
00:43:24,737 --> 00:43:29,737
# Oh, me and my baby say

756
00:43:30,157 --> 00:43:32,847
# Gonna rock with my doll

757
00:43:32,848 --> 00:43:35,431
# 'Cause nobody else

758
00:43:35,432 --> 00:43:40,432
# Oh, me and my baby say

759
00:43:40,815 --> 00:43:42,132
# Gonna rock #

760
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:43,477

# Gonna rock, rock,

762
00:43:46,217 --> 00:43:49,203
# Gonna keep on rockin'
'til a quarter to 10 #

763
00:43:49,204 --> 00:43:51,539
# Come up for air and go rockin' again #

764
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:56,540
# Oh, me and my baby say
we're gonna rock tonight #

765
00:43:56,889 --> 00:43:59,627
# Gonna keep on rockin'
'til a quarter to 11 #

766
00:43:59,628 --> 00:44:02,327
# And rock along up half ways to heaven #

767
00:44:02,328 --> 00:44:07,328
# 'Cause me and my baby say
we're gonna rock tonight #

768
00:44:07,618 --> 00:44:08,941
# Gonna rock #

769
00:44:08,942 --> 00:44:10,325
# Gonna rock #

# Gonna rock, rock,

# Gonna go on rockin'
'til a quarter to 12 #

772
00:44:16,034 --> 00:44:18,398
# Havin' a ball enjoying ourselves #

773
00:44:18,399 --> 00:44:23,399
# 'Cause me and my baby,
we're gonna rock tonight #

774
00:44:23,746 --> 00:44:26,778
# Gonna get to the door
about a quarter to one #

775
00:44:26,779 --> 00:44:29,153
# Kiss for awhile, what a barrel of fun #

776
00:44:29,154 --> 00:44:34,154
# 'Cause me and my baby say

777
00:44:34,478 --> 00:44:35,786

781
00:44:42,614 --> 00:44:45,240

782
00:44:45,241 --> 00:44:46,953

783
00:44:46,954 --> 00:44:50,537
# We're gonna rock tonight #

784
00:44:55,798 --> 00:44:58,636
(crowd cheering)

785
00:44:58,637 --> 00:45:01,387
(birds chirping)

786
00:45:02,945 --> 00:45:05,303
[Gloria] Hello, Dori.

787
00:45:05,304 --> 00:45:06,971
Oh, hello, Gloria.

788
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:12,857
I've just picked up
my new evening dress.

789
00:45:12,858 --> 00:45:13,895
Oh.

790
00:45:13,896 --> 00:45:16,255
Have you gotten yours yet?

791
00:45:16,256 --> 00:45:19,712
Well, I haven't had time yet but I will.

792
00:45:19,713 --> 00:45:22,663
By the way, Gloria, do you need money?

793
00:45:22,664 --> 00:45:24,692
I always need money.

794
00:45:24,693 --> 00:45:26,371
Then I'm the one who can lend it to you.

795
00:45:26,372 --> 00:45:28,356
I've just gone into the banking business.

796
00:45:28,357 --> 00:45:29,626
What?

797
00:45:29,627 --> 00:45:31,040
I'm lending money.

798
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:35,063
$1.00 until next allowance
day to anyone who needs it.

799
00:45:35,064 --> 00:45:36,984
What's your rate of interest?

800
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:39,676
Well, the bank charges as high as 6%,

801
00:45:39,677 --> 00:45:41,606
but I'm only charging one.

802
00:45:41,607 --> 00:45:43,628
Just 1%?

803
00:45:43,629 --> 00:45:45,179
If I lend you a dollar,

804
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:48,653
you pay it back to me plus
another dollar interest.

805
00:45:48,654 --> 00:45:50,961
Another dollar interest?

806
00:45:50,962 --> 00:45:52,028
It's a bargain when you think

807
00:45:52,029 --> 00:45:55,021
the banks are charging as much as 6%.

808
00:45:55,022 --> 00:45:58,932
Are you sure you're charging
$1.00 interest on the dollar?

809
00:45:58,933 --> 00:46:02,639
1% of a dollar is a dollar, isn't it?

810
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,057
Oh, sure, sure.

811
00:46:05,211 --> 00:46:08,878
Tell me, Dori, have you
lent much money yet?

812
00:46:09,741 --> 00:46:12,084
You're the first person I've asked.

813
00:46:12,085 --> 00:46:14,879
Mm-hmm, where'd you
get the money to lend?

814
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,056
From Arabella.

815
00:46:16,057 --> 00:46:17,305
She's my depositor.

816
00:46:17,306 --> 00:46:19,583
How much did she deposit?

817
00:46:19,584 --> 00:46:20,417
$15.00.

818
00:46:21,484 --> 00:46:24,376
Dori, instead of trying to find a lot

819
00:46:24,377 --> 00:46:26,445
of little $1.00 customers,

820
00:46:26,446 --> 00:46:31,446
how would you like to lend the
whole 15 to just one person?

821
00:46:31,572 --> 00:46:32,955
Who?

822
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,420
Me, with $15.00 more,

823
00:46:35,421 --> 00:46:37,489
I could take this tacky ole evening dress

824
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:39,044
back to the dress shop.

825
00:46:39,045 --> 00:46:42,446
I saw a much smarter one there for $45.00.

826
00:46:42,447 --> 00:46:44,011
It just came in.

827
00:46:44,012 --> 00:46:47,028
If you lend me the 15 to
buy it, I'll pay ya back

828
00:46:47,029 --> 00:46:49,288
plus another 15 for interest.

829
00:46:49,289 --> 00:46:51,289
You'll make $15.00 fast.

830
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:56,018
When will you pay it back?

831
00:46:56,019 --> 00:46:58,393
My birthday's next week.

832
00:46:58,394 --> 00:47:00,322
I'm expecting a couple of checks.

833
00:47:00,323 --> 00:47:02,726
I'll pay ya back then.

834
00:47:02,727 --> 00:47:04,635
Will you give me collateral?

835
00:47:04,636 --> 00:47:07,190
What kind of collateral?

836
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:08,317
Oh, I don't know.

837
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:11,354
It has to be something
worth at least $30.00.

838
00:47:11,355 --> 00:47:13,365
Tell you what, I'll pledge my new dress.

839
00:47:13,366 --> 00:47:15,173
The one I'm going to get.

840
00:47:15,174 --> 00:47:17,264
Alright, you write me a note saying,

841
00:47:17,265 --> 00:47:20,872
that if you don't pay me
back, I can have the dress.

842
00:47:20,873 --> 00:47:22,474
Then I'll lend you the $15.00.

843
00:47:22,475 --> 00:47:23,642
It's a deal.

844
00:47:27,421 --> 00:47:30,650
Tommy, can I ask you something?

845
00:47:30,651 --> 00:47:32,234
- Sure.
- Come here.

846
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:39,007
Tommy, what do you think the school

847
00:47:39,008 --> 00:47:41,513
would think of a girl who took advantage

848
00:47:41,514 --> 00:47:44,027
of one of her own classmates?

849
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,398
Well, I guess they
wouldn't like here very much.

850
00:47:46,399 --> 00:47:49,052
Suppose this girl learned
that one of her classmates

851
00:47:49,053 --> 00:47:50,903
needed money very badly,

852
00:47:50,904 --> 00:47:52,681
and she lent it to her?

853
00:47:52,682 --> 00:47:54,328
Well that's not taking advantage.

854
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,742
That's pretty nice.

855
00:47:55,743 --> 00:47:57,369
But what if she lent it to her

856
00:47:57,370 --> 00:48:01,352
on condition that she pay it back double?

857
00:48:01,353 --> 00:48:02,977
Double?

858
00:48:02,978 --> 00:48:05,132
Who'd do a thing like that?

859
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:06,541
Dori.

860
00:48:06,542 --> 00:48:07,559
Dori?

861
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,205
(chuckling) I don't believe it.

862
00:48:09,206 --> 00:48:10,706
You can ask her.

863
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:12,637
But why?

864
00:48:12,638 --> 00:48:16,353
She was just trying to
make some money for herself.

865
00:48:16,354 --> 00:48:18,171
Who told you all this?

866
00:48:18,172 --> 00:48:21,619
I'm the one she lent the money to.

867
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:23,482
That's terrible.

868
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,721
Would be even more terrible

869
00:48:24,722 --> 00:48:28,223
if the whole school found out about it.

870
00:48:28,224 --> 00:48:33,224
Of course, I might be persuaded
not to tell anyone about it.

871
00:48:34,004 --> 00:48:34,948
What do you mean?

872
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:38,890
Well, if you took me to
the prom instead of Dori,

873
00:48:38,891 --> 00:48:42,641
I might just possibly
forget the whole thing.

874
00:48:43,493 --> 00:48:45,100
But I already asked Dori.

875
00:48:45,101 --> 00:48:48,840
You can always say you
forget you'd asked me first.

876
00:48:48,841 --> 00:48:50,334
I can't do that.

877
00:48:50,335 --> 00:48:51,702
Would you rather the whole school

878
00:48:51,703 --> 00:48:54,545
knew about what Dori tried to do to me?

879
00:48:54,546 --> 00:48:57,546
Nobody would talk to her for months.

880
00:49:01,906 --> 00:49:04,489
(bell ringing)

881
00:49:07,832 --> 00:49:10,334
Dori, wait a minute.

882
00:49:10,335 --> 00:49:11,796
Dori, I got wonderful news.

883
00:49:11,797 --> 00:49:13,448
- What is it?
- It's Melville.

884
00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:15,213
He's taking me to the prom.

885
00:49:15,214 --> 00:49:18,033
He asked me just five minutes ago.

886
00:49:18,034 --> 00:49:20,386
Oh, that's wonderful.

887
00:49:20,387 --> 00:49:22,050
This is my big chance.

888
00:49:22,051 --> 00:49:24,856
That's why I need the $15.00 I gave you.

889
00:49:24,857 --> 00:49:26,270
Oh, no.

890
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,544
I've got to get a permed, a manicure,

891
00:49:28,545 --> 00:49:31,508
and maybe even a facial,
so give me back the money.

892
00:49:31,509 --> 00:49:33,501
I've already loaned it out.

893
00:49:33,502 --> 00:49:35,059
Then get it back.

894
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:37,125
A depositor has the right
to get her money back

895
00:49:37,126 --> 00:49:38,910
when she wants it, doesn't she?

896
00:49:38,911 --> 00:49:39,744
Well, yes, but...

897
00:49:39,745 --> 00:49:42,062
[Arabella] Well this is an emergency.

898
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:44,751
Arabella, I just can't.

899
00:49:44,752 --> 00:49:48,208
Dori Graham, if you
don't give me back my money

900
00:49:48,209 --> 00:49:53,004
by tomorrow, I'll, I'll
never speak to you again.

901
00:49:53,005 --> 00:49:53,922
Arabella?

902
00:50:06,582 --> 00:50:08,082
Gloria, come here.

903
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,517
Gloria, I wanna talk to you.

904
00:50:11,518 --> 00:50:13,093
Well?

905
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:15,712
It's about that money you borrowed.

906
00:50:15,713 --> 00:50:17,226
Your birthday was last week,

907
00:50:17,227 --> 00:50:19,647
and you still haven't paid it back to me.

908
00:50:19,648 --> 00:50:21,281
Oh, that, you really didn't think

909
00:50:21,282 --> 00:50:23,613
I was going to pay it back, did you?

910
00:50:23,614 --> 00:50:26,459
Besides, my birthday isn't
until five months from now.

911
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,738
But you told me that...

912
00:50:27,739 --> 00:50:30,417
And you told me you
wanted $1.00 interest

913
00:50:30,418 --> 00:50:32,332
on every dollar you lent me.

914
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:37,333
For your information, that's
not 1% interest, that's 100%.

915
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,799
It is?

916
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,437
If you knew any arithmetic,

917
00:50:40,438 --> 00:50:44,514
you'd know that 1% of a
dollar is .01 not $1.00.

918
00:50:44,515 --> 00:50:47,679
Why I could send you
to jail for extortion.

919
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,215
Well, what about the $15.00?

920
00:50:50,216 --> 00:50:52,269
You'll return that to me, won't you?

921
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:53,903
In my own good time.

922
00:50:53,904 --> 00:50:55,720
Maybe a dollar a week.

923
00:50:55,721 --> 00:50:57,440
But I need the money now.

924
00:50:57,441 --> 00:50:59,524
Oh, isn't that too bad.

925
00:51:00,422 --> 00:51:03,147
Well, I've gotta study for my next class,

926
00:51:03,148 --> 00:51:07,707
and, uh, you'd better brush
up on your arithmetic.

927
00:51:07,708 --> 00:51:10,875
(students chattering)

928
00:51:27,571 --> 00:51:28,404
Dori?

929
00:51:29,746 --> 00:51:30,579
Oh.

930
00:51:32,397 --> 00:51:33,480
Hello, Tommy.

931
00:51:34,618 --> 00:51:36,915
What's the matter?

932
00:51:36,916 --> 00:51:38,083
Oh, nothing.

933
00:51:39,007 --> 00:51:42,566
Have you been talking to Gloria?

934
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:43,984
Did she tell you?

935
00:51:44,821 --> 00:51:46,071
Tell me what?

936
00:51:47,658 --> 00:51:50,908
That's she going to the prom with me.

937
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:52,808
What?

938
00:51:53,946 --> 00:51:55,026
I asked her weeks ago,

939
00:51:55,027 --> 00:51:58,444
and I'd thought she'd forgotten about it.

940
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:02,017
Gloria

941
00:52:05,904 --> 00:52:06,737
and you?

942
00:52:12,152 --> 00:52:15,152
Oh, Tommy. (crying)

943
00:52:20,162 --> 00:52:22,829
(bird chirping)

944
00:52:27,429 --> 00:52:29,108
Poor little bird.

945
00:52:29,109 --> 00:52:31,192
I know just how you feel.

946
00:52:33,549 --> 00:52:38,232
(atmospheric orchestral music)

947
00:52:38,233 --> 00:52:42,674
# Little blue wren #

948
00:52:42,675 --> 00:52:45,721
# I know why #

949
00:52:45,722 --> 00:52:48,891
# Little blue wren #

950
00:52:48,892 --> 00:52:52,213
# Why you cry #

951
00:52:52,214 --> 00:52:55,556
# Nobody knows #

952
00:52:55,557 --> 00:52:58,962
# Nobody cares #

953
00:52:58,963 --> 00:53:03,963
# That your love has flown away #

954
00:53:05,331 --> 00:53:08,715
# Little blue wren #

955
00:53:08,716 --> 00:53:12,011
# In the sky #

956
00:53:12,012 --> 00:53:15,472
# Little blue wren #

957
00:53:15,473 --> 00:53:18,704
# Way up high #

958
00:53:18,705 --> 00:53:22,205
# Love didn't stay #

959
00:53:22,206 --> 00:53:25,423
# It flew away #

960
00:53:25,424 --> 00:53:27,581
# Now your heart's #

961
00:53:27,582 --> 00:53:32,222
# No longer gay #

962
00:53:32,223 --> 00:53:34,249
# With your head #

963
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:39,060
# Upon your shoulder #

964
00:53:39,061 --> 00:53:41,718
# You just cry #

965
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:45,935
# And hope that he #

966
00:53:45,936 --> 00:53:48,407
# Will return #

967
00:53:48,408 --> 00:53:52,765
# Before you're older #

968
00:53:52,766 --> 00:53:57,766
# And I know 'cause it happened to me #

969
00:53:58,836 --> 00:54:02,970
# So little blue wren #

970
00:54:02,971 --> 00:54:05,908
# In a tree #

971
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:09,542
# Little blue wren #

972
00:54:09,543 --> 00:54:12,768
# Wait and see #

973
00:54:12,769 --> 00:54:16,461
# Some day he'll know #

974
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:19,595
# You love him so #

975
00:54:19,596 --> 00:54:21,705
# And then he'll #

976
00:54:21,706 --> 00:54:26,706
# Come back again #

977
00:54:29,138 --> 00:54:30,948
# And you'll #

978
00:54:30,949 --> 00:54:34,604
# No more be #

979
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:39,490
# A little #

980
00:54:39,491 --> 00:54:41,284
# Blue #

981
00:54:41,285 --> 00:54:43,202
# Wren #

982
00:54:54,385 --> 00:54:56,968
(Dori sighing)

983
00:54:59,762 --> 00:55:02,345
(Dori sighing)

984
00:55:06,472 --> 00:55:09,797
Well, what's the matter now?

985
00:55:09,798 --> 00:55:10,965
Oh, nothing.

986
00:55:15,379 --> 00:55:18,811
Father, if a person lends
another person money,

987
00:55:18,812 --> 00:55:21,411
and the other person refuses to pay,

988
00:55:21,412 --> 00:55:24,725
can that person do anything
to the other person?

989
00:55:24,726 --> 00:55:26,274
Well, that depends.

990
00:55:26,275 --> 00:55:28,371
Did the other person give the person

991
00:55:28,372 --> 00:55:30,729
any collateral for the loan?

992
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:32,317
Yeah, she did.

993
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:34,632
Well, then the person can foreclose.

994
00:55:34,633 --> 00:55:35,466
Foreclose?

995
00:55:35,467 --> 00:55:38,512
Uh-huh, assume ownership
of the collateral

996
00:55:38,513 --> 00:55:40,763
in lieu of the unpaid loan.

997
00:55:42,271 --> 00:55:44,521
Assume ownership, really?

998
00:55:45,564 --> 00:55:46,814
It's the law.

999
00:55:49,167 --> 00:55:51,304
Hey, where are you going,
it's almost dinner time?

1000
00:55:51,305 --> 00:55:55,138
Tell Mother not to
wait, I'll be back later.

1001
00:56:03,882 --> 00:56:06,151
But it's very simple, Miss Silky.

1002
00:56:06,152 --> 00:56:09,150
I just wanna foreclose
on a collateral dress.

1003
00:56:09,151 --> 00:56:10,379
But I don't understand?

1004
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,022
Is this some kind of joke?

1005
00:56:12,023 --> 00:56:14,769
It's absolutely serious.

1006
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:18,020
Would you mind waiting just a minute?

1007
00:56:30,893 --> 00:56:33,913
Miss Silky, is my dress almost ready?

1008
00:56:33,914 --> 00:56:36,331
[Miss Silky] Just a minute.

1009
00:56:38,445 --> 00:56:39,362
Here it is.

1010
00:56:41,025 --> 00:56:41,858
Oh.

1011
00:56:43,814 --> 00:56:46,846
It's so beautiful.
(door bell ringing)

1012
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:49,329
I can't wait to see what
it looks like on me.

1013
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:50,163
Dori?

1014
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,510
Thank you for calling me, Miss Silky.

1015
00:56:53,511 --> 00:56:56,553
Father, what are you doing here?

1016
00:56:56,554 --> 00:56:58,673
This is a ladies shop.

1017
00:56:58,674 --> 00:56:59,689
Miss Silky called me,

1018
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:00,719
and told me she'd keep you here

1019
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,150
until I could get here.
(door bell ringing)

1020
00:57:02,151 --> 00:57:04,318
Now what's this all about?

1021
00:57:06,439 --> 00:57:09,480
Yeah, that's what I wanna know.

1022
00:57:09,481 --> 00:57:11,522
I tried to tell you on
the phone, Mr. Barker.

1023
00:57:11,523 --> 00:57:13,262
Dori says your daughter
borrowed some money from her

1024
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,140
and refused to pay it back,

1025
00:57:15,141 --> 00:57:17,622
and now she's claiming this dress.

1026
00:57:17,623 --> 00:57:20,173
I'm just foreclosing on the collateral.

1027
00:57:20,174 --> 00:57:21,859
You mean, Gloria gave you this dress

1028
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,613
as collateral for a loan?

1029
00:57:23,614 --> 00:57:25,856
Why did you have to borrow money?

1030
00:57:25,857 --> 00:57:29,637
Well, I didn't really like
the $30.00 dress you bought me,

1031
00:57:29,638 --> 00:57:34,006
and I happened to see this
beautiful dress for $45.00,

1032
00:57:34,007 --> 00:57:36,657
and I knew you wouldn't
give me anymore money, so...

1033
00:57:36,658 --> 00:57:39,184
So you borrowed it from my daughter,

1034
00:57:39,185 --> 00:57:41,234
but where did Dori get it to lend?

1035
00:57:41,235 --> 00:57:43,036
She borrowed it form Arabella.

1036
00:57:43,037 --> 00:57:44,442
No, I didn't.

1037
00:57:44,443 --> 00:57:46,572
Arabella was my depositor.

1038
00:57:46,573 --> 00:57:48,646
But I don't have to pay the money back

1039
00:57:48,647 --> 00:57:51,653
because Dori charged me 100% interest

1040
00:57:51,654 --> 00:57:53,255
when she gave me the money,

1041
00:57:53,256 --> 00:57:55,410
and that's against the law.

1042
00:57:55,411 --> 00:57:57,161
100% interest?

1043
00:57:58,291 --> 00:57:59,124
Dori.

1044
00:58:00,056 --> 00:58:02,169
I made a mistake, Father.

1045
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:05,318
I thought I was charging 1%.

1046
00:58:05,319 --> 00:58:08,047
Never was very good at arithmetic

1047
00:58:08,048 --> 00:58:10,723
but she knew it, and she didn't tell me.

1048
00:58:10,724 --> 00:58:11,786
Besides, you said the dress

1049
00:58:11,787 --> 00:58:14,232
belonged to me as collateral.

1050
00:58:14,233 --> 00:58:16,650
Well, yes, it does legally.

1051
00:58:17,557 --> 00:58:20,209
Now wait just a minute.

1052
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:22,958
I paid $30.00 for that dress.

1053
00:58:22,959 --> 00:58:25,829
And I paid another $15.00.

1054
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:27,146
I'm not going to let you take

1055
00:58:27,147 --> 00:58:29,897
a $45.00 dress for a $15.00 loan.

1056
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:33,504
Well, there's only
one other thing to do.

1057
00:58:33,505 --> 00:58:36,130
Pay Dori the money that
Gloria borrowed from her,

1058
00:58:36,131 --> 00:58:38,714
and forget the whole the thing.

1059
00:58:40,153 --> 00:58:43,568
I'm not going to pay Gloria's debt.

1060
00:58:43,569 --> 00:58:45,270
Well, I admit, you got me stumped.

1061
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:47,685
Do you have any other suggestions?

1062
00:58:47,686 --> 00:58:49,341
- No.
- Do you?

1063
00:58:49,342 --> 00:58:50,708
No.

1064
00:58:50,709 --> 00:58:52,542
I have a suggestion.

1065
00:58:53,569 --> 00:58:56,043
Mr. Barker just wants his $30.00.

1066
00:58:56,044 --> 00:58:56,877
Right.

1067
00:58:58,139 --> 00:59:01,744
Father, here's a chance for
you to make a real bargain.

1068
00:59:01,745 --> 00:59:05,190
All you have to do is give
Mr. Barker his $30.00,

1069
00:59:05,191 --> 00:59:09,822
and you get a $45.00 dollar
dress for only $30.00.

1070
00:59:09,823 --> 00:59:11,490
Yeah, sounds good.

1071
00:59:13,695 --> 00:59:15,360
Now, wait a minute, young lady.

1072
00:59:15,361 --> 00:59:18,038
Our agreement was that I pay $15.00,

1073
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:20,569
and you earn the other 15.

1074
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:24,946
Yes, but I'm saving you $15.00
at the price of the dress.

1075
00:59:24,947 --> 00:59:28,759
Now that's the same as if
I earned $15.00, isn't it?

1076
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,824
Now, just do as I say.

1077
00:59:30,825 --> 00:59:34,408
First, give Gloria's
father his money back.

1078
00:59:37,547 --> 00:59:39,464
Now, the dress is mine.

1079
00:59:40,895 --> 00:59:45,701
But you still have to
give Arabella her $15.00.

1080
00:59:45,702 --> 00:59:48,799
How do you think you'll get around that?

1081
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,358
Oh, that's simple.

1082
00:59:50,359 --> 00:59:53,789
Here, Miss Silky, I'd like
to turn this $45.00 dress in

1083
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:57,267
for the $30.00 dress and a $15.00 refund.

1084
00:59:57,268 --> 00:59:58,716
Now you can get the dress for me.

1085
00:59:58,717 --> 01:00:01,062
It's only $15.00 more.

1086
01:00:01,063 --> 01:00:03,225
After all the trouble you've caused?

1087
01:00:03,226 --> 01:00:05,122
Trying to take advantage of Dori?

1088
01:00:05,123 --> 01:00:09,046
Sneaking behind my back to
buy a dress that costs more?

1089
01:00:09,047 --> 01:00:10,537
Nothing doing, Gloria.

1090
01:00:10,538 --> 01:00:12,799
I don't buy any dress for you.

1091
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:15,182
Not even a $30.00 one?

1092
01:00:15,183 --> 01:00:17,972
Sorry, this is the last one left.

1093
01:00:17,973 --> 01:00:20,056
A blue strapless dress.

1094
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:23,101
Tommy's favorite color.

1095
01:00:23,962 --> 01:00:25,962
She's taking my dress.

1096
01:00:27,221 --> 01:00:29,468
Come on, we're going home.

1097
01:00:29,469 --> 01:00:30,302
Oh.

1098
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:33,277
Now let me see.

1099
01:00:34,234 --> 01:00:35,984
Dori saved me $15.00,

1100
01:00:37,469 --> 01:00:40,982
so that's the same as earning $15.00.

1101
01:00:40,983 --> 01:00:43,241
Then she took the dress,

1102
01:00:43,242 --> 01:00:47,133
she exchanged the $45.00
dress for the $30.00 dress...

1103
01:00:47,134 --> 01:00:48,732
Here's your refund, Dori.

1104
01:00:48,733 --> 01:00:50,750
Come in in the morning,
and we'll fit the dress.

1105
01:00:50,751 --> 01:00:53,358
Thank you, Miss Silky.

1106
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:55,024
We'd better go home, Father.

1107
01:00:55,025 --> 01:00:57,854
Dinner's probably still waiting.

1108
01:00:57,855 --> 01:00:59,855
Father, are you alright?

1109
01:01:01,428 --> 01:01:03,345
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

1110
01:01:06,215 --> 01:01:08,382
Oh, goodnight, Miss Silky.

1111
01:01:15,042 --> 01:01:18,042
(crickets chirping)

1112
01:01:20,623 --> 01:01:22,956
(drum roll)

1113
01:01:27,021 --> 01:01:28,215
Everybody quiet.

1114
01:01:28,216 --> 01:01:30,049
Alright, let's get this prom rocking

1115
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:32,243
with Jimmy Cavallo and the House Rockers

1116
01:01:32,244 --> 01:01:33,994
and Rock, Rock, Rock.

1117
01:01:34,978 --> 01:01:36,256
# Grab your partner #

1118
01:01:36,257 --> 01:01:37,318
# Grab your gal #

1119
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:38,152
# And rock #

1120
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:39,928
(upbeat rock music)

1121
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:42,109
# Rock, rock, rock, rock everybody #

1122
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:44,309
# Rock, rock, rock, rock everybody #

1123
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:46,451
# Rock, rock, rock, rock everybody #

1124
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:48,826
# Ya rockin' and ya rockin'
and ya rockin' around #

1125
01:01:48,827 --> 01:01:51,048
# Roll, roll, roll, roll everybody #

1126
01:01:51,049 --> 01:01:53,350
# Roll, roll, roll, roll everybody #

1127
01:01:53,351 --> 01:01:55,488
# Roll, roll, roll, roll everybody #

1128
01:01:55,489 --> 01:01:57,828
# Ya rollin' and ya rollin'
and ya rollin' around #

1129
01:01:57,829 --> 01:01:59,981
# Rock, rock, rock everybody #

1130
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:02,262
# Roll, roll, roll everybody #

1131
01:02:02,263 --> 01:02:04,463
# Rock, rock, rock everybody #

1132
01:02:04,464 --> 01:02:06,896
# Ya rockin' and ya rockin'

Rock'n roll is a river of music

1163
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:54,434
which has absorbed many streams.

1164
01:03:54,435 --> 01:03:57,154
Rhythm and blues, jazz, ragtime,

1165

cowboy songs, country songs, folk songs,

1166
01:03:59,403 --> 01:04:02,195
all have contributed
greatly to the big beat,

1167
01:04:02,196 --> 01:04:03,338
and here's a young man who's come out

# Lonesome train, on a lonesome track #

1182
01:05:29,267 --> 01:05:34,267
# My girl don't love
me and that's a fact #

1183

1187
01:05:57,143 --> 01:06:02,143
# Don't want to go on forever traveling #

on a lonesome track #

1189
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:12,660
(crowd cheering)

1190
01:06:16,965 --> 01:06:20,194

01:06:41,735 --> 01:06:46,735
# And I cried over and over again #

1200
01:06:47,672 --> 01:06:52,672
# Why do I listen to all of your lies #

1201
01:06:53,737 --> 01:06:57,851
# I love you, that's why #

1202

# My heart says you will return #

1211
01:07:43,611 --> 01:07:48,611
# And fill these empty heart of mine #

1212
01:07:49,913 --> 01:07:54,913
# I give in over and over again #

1213
01:07:56,217 --> 01:08:01,217
# And you win over and over again #

1214
01:08:02,069 --> 01:08:07,069
# And if you ask me the reason why #

01:08:08,496 --> 01:08:10,470
# I love you #

1216
01:08:10,471 --> 01:08:12,837
# That's #

1217
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:15,091
# Why #

1218

(audience cheering)

1220
01:08:26,557 --> 01:08:29,213

(audience cheering)

1284

I don't know what I can
say about this next act.

1285
01:13:04,819 --> 01:13:07,666
What can you say but sensational?

1286
01:13:07,667 --> 01:13:10,266
All over the world, Frankie Lymon.

1287

(crowd cheering)

1326
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:36,393
# I'm not a juvenile delinquent #

# And life will be so nice,

1334
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:06,090
# I know #

1335
01:16:06,091 --> 01:16:11,091
# Because I'm not a juvenile delinquent #

1336
01:16:13,091 --> 01:16:15,204
# But listen boys and girls #

1337
01:16:15,205 --> 01:16:17,472
# You need not be blue #

1338
01:16:17,473 --> 01:16:19,799
# And life is what you make of it #

1339
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:22,063
# It all depends on you #

1340
01:16:22,064 --> 01:16:24,430

# Because I'm not a juvenile delinquent #

1362
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:46,865
# No, no, no #

1363
01:17:46,866 --> 01:17:49,672
# I'm not a juvenile #

(crowd cheering)

1369
01:18:23,843 --> 01:18:25,260
Want some more?

1370
01:18:39,227 --> 01:18:42,273
Dori, I've gotta talk to you.

1371
01:18:42,274 --> 01:18:44,030
I told you on the phone,

1372
01:18:44,031 --> 01:18:46,302
I have nothing more to say to you.

1373
01:18:46,303 --> 01:18:48,360
Gloria made me take her to the prom.

1374
01:18:48,361 --> 01:18:50,719
How could she make you take her?

1375
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,224
She said she'd tell everyone in school

1376
01:18:52,225 --> 01:18:54,779
about you trying to cheat
her out of some money

1377
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:56,280
unless I took her.

1378
01:18:57,635 --> 01:18:59,220
And you believed her?

1379
01:18:59,221 --> 01:19:01,888
I didn't believe you'd do anything bad,

1380
01:19:01,889 --> 01:19:04,889
but I believed she'd tell everybody.

1381
01:19:06,284 --> 01:19:09,701
And now, here is your own singing star,

1382
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:12,041
Tommy Rogers.

1383
01:19:14,216 --> 01:19:15,049
Go on.

1384
01:19:18,531 --> 01:19:21,281
(crowd cheering)

1385
01:19:30,419 --> 01:19:34,027
This song is for someone very special

1386
01:19:34,028 --> 01:19:35,778
who knows who she is.

1387
01:19:38,704 --> 01:19:42,319
# I was wrong to make you cry #

1388
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:46,233
# I will love you 'til I die #

1389
01:19:46,234 --> 01:19:50,595
# Give one more chance #

1390
01:19:50,596 --> 01:19:55,596
# Won't you give me a chance #

1391
01:19:57,676 --> 01:19:59,361
# To give #

1392
01:19:59,362 --> 01:20:04,362
# My heart to you #

1393
01:20:05,283 --> 01:20:10,283
# Won't give me a chance #

1394
01:20:11,029 --> 01:20:13,256
# To be #

1395
01:20:13,257 --> 01:20:18,257
# A part of you #

1396
01:20:18,523 --> 01:20:21,709
# When I see you holding #

1397
01:20:21,710 --> 01:20:26,389
# Someone in your arms #

1398
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:31,390
# So tenderly #

1399
01:20:31,846 --> 01:20:34,642
# How I wish that someone #

1400
01:20:34,643 --> 01:20:39,428
# Someone, someway, somehow #
# Ooh, someday #

1401
01:20:39,429 --> 01:20:44,003
# It could be me #

1402
01:20:44,004 --> 01:20:47,229
# Won't you give just a glance #

1403
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:50,773
# Please give me a glance #

1404
01:20:50,774 --> 01:20:54,823
# In my direction #

1405
01:20:54,824 --> 01:20:57,148
# In my direction #

1406
01:20:57,149 --> 01:21:00,315
# Won't you give me a chance #

1407
01:21:00,316 --> 01:21:03,637
# Please give me one chance #

1408
01:21:03,638 --> 01:21:06,474
# For your affection #

1409
01:21:06,475 --> 01:21:10,404
# For your affection #

1410
01:21:10,405 --> 01:21:15,123
# I know that you and I #

1411
01:21:15,124 --> 01:21:20,124
# Were made for the perfect romance #

1412
01:21:23,342 --> 01:21:28,342
# And I can prove it to you #

1413
01:21:29,927 --> 01:21:34,927
# If you give me a chance #

1414
01:21:36,010 --> 01:21:37,980
# I know #

1415
01:21:37,981 --> 01:21:41,323
# That you and I #

1416
01:21:41,324 --> 01:21:46,324

(audience cheering)

1423
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:43,970
Tommy, I'm sorry I didn't
give you a chance to explain.

1424
01:22:44,326 --> 01:22:47,094
And I'm sorry I even could have thought

1425
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:48,345
for a minute...

1426
01:22:50,490 --> 01:22:52,173
And now, everybody, let's really rock

1427
01:22:52,174 --> 01:22:56,990

band and Right Now, Right Now.
