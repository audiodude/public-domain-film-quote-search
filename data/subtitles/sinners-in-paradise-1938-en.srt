1
00:01:21,673 --> 00:01:23,593
Anne, this is truly ridiculous.

2
00:01:23,594 --> 00:01:24,986
I'm not going to let you go.

3
00:01:24,987 --> 00:01:26,204
I'm going on that plane.

4
00:01:26,205 --> 00:01:27,946
Of all the mad, insane...

5
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,165
Oh Alex, please.

6
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:30,426
We've been over this so many times.

7
00:01:30,427 --> 00:01:31,819
Let's face it.

8
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,385
We haven't been happy
for the past two years.

9
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:34,387
All right.

10
00:01:34,388 --> 00:01:35,474
It's been my fault. I admit it.

11
00:01:35,475 --> 00:01:36,693
I demand you cancel this trip.

12
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:38,087
Demand?

13
00:01:38,088 --> 00:01:39,478
Don't think you're putting
anything over on me.

14
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,959
China, Red Cross.

15
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:42,395
But I...

16
00:01:42,396 --> 00:01:43,830
There are plenty of
unmarried women for that.

17
00:01:43,831 --> 00:01:45,006
That's not why you're going.

18
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:46,660
Oh please.

19
00:01:46,661 --> 00:01:48,009
You're going to see someone
else who's asked you to come.

20
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,576
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:51,534
But if you refuse to be
reasonable, I'll divorce you.

22
00:01:51,535 --> 00:01:53,449
I'll charge you with desertion.

23
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,755
All right, Alex.

24
00:01:54,756 --> 00:01:56,843
If that's the way
you want it, do that.

25
00:01:56,844 --> 00:01:59,542
Honolulu, Coral,
Island, Guam and the Orient.

26
00:01:59,543 --> 00:02:00,935
Mrs. Alexander Wesson.

27
00:02:00,936 --> 00:02:02,371
All passengers for the Sea Bird,

28
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:05,026
please collect your tickets and go
immediately into the Class Lounge.

29
00:02:05,027 --> 00:02:05,896
My luggage.

30
00:02:05,897 --> 00:02:06,985
Yes, sir.

31
00:02:06,986 --> 00:02:08,725
Now Marshall, is
everything in order?

32
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:10,075
Yes, Ms. Chase.

33
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:11,684
Here are your passports
and health certificate.

34
00:02:11,685 --> 00:02:14,035
I made the reservations in
the name of Doris Bailey.

35
00:02:14,036 --> 00:02:15,384
Well, thank you, Marshall.

36
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,167
I'll cable as soon
as I reach Hong Kong.

37
00:02:16,168 --> 00:02:17,300
Yes, Ms. Chase.

38
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:19,040
Thank you and a pleasant journey.

39
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,912
Say, buddy, who was that?

40
00:02:20,956 --> 00:02:24,394
I... Ms. Doris Bailey.

41
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:27,657
Everything's in order, Ms.
Chase, I mean Ms. Bailey.

42
00:02:27,658 --> 00:02:30,835
You know, we feel a great
responsibility having you on board.

43
00:02:30,836 --> 00:02:32,879
Won't you just wait in
the lounge, Ms. Bailey?

44
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,708
State Senator Cory.

45
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:35,882
Senator Cory, just a moment.

46
00:02:35,883 --> 00:02:36,666
Hold it.

47
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:38,277
Thank you.

48
00:02:38,278 --> 00:02:39,669
Now Senator, give us the old
"Star Spangled Banner" look.

49
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,932
Thank you.

50
00:02:40,933 --> 00:02:42,628
Are you flying to
China, Senator Cory?

51
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,586
Well, I'm not walking.

52
00:02:43,587 --> 00:02:44,980
First trip, Senator?

53
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:48,199
Yes, this will be the first time that
I take wings over the Great Pacific.

54
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,028
Pardon, Senator, is this trip government
business or a private deal in China?

55
00:02:51,029 --> 00:02:52,204
You astonish me.

56
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,031
What kind of a
private deal could I...

57
00:02:54,032 --> 00:02:56,992
Senator, you know they need a lot of
war supplies over there these days.

58
00:02:56,993 --> 00:02:58,470
And with the right man on the job...

59
00:02:58,471 --> 00:02:59,167
Very bright, very clever.
Good day, gentlemen.

60
00:02:59,168 --> 00:03:00,473
But Sentator...

61
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:01,821
- Here you are, Mr. Honeyman.
- Thank you.

62
00:03:01,822 --> 00:03:03,214
Mr. Brand,
calling Mr. Brand.

63
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:04,824
Message for Mr. Brand
at the information desk.

64
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:05,783
Brand?

65
00:03:05,784 --> 00:03:07,436
Is that Mr. Harrison Brand?

66
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,306
Is he a passenger?

67
00:03:08,307 --> 00:03:10,701
Yes sir.

68
00:03:10,702 --> 00:03:12,310
Sydney, Mrs. Franklin Sydney.

69
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:13,790
Do you have your passport
and certificate of health

70
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,139
for your return, Mrs. Sydney?

71
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:15,923
Yes.

72
00:03:15,924 --> 00:03:16,836
May I have them?

73
00:03:16,837 --> 00:03:19,231
Oh yes, here they are.

74
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,449
This is going to be very exciting.

75
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,407
Really?

76
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:22,755
Yes, my son is in Shanghai.

77
00:03:22,756 --> 00:03:23,756
He doesn't know I'm coming.

78
00:03:23,757 --> 00:03:25,597
It's been too long since I...

79
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:27,195
Oh, sorry to be
taking so much time.

80
00:03:27,196 --> 00:03:28,457
Are you one of the passengers?

81
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:32,331
I won't be if you don't step on it.

82
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,854
Iris Compton.

83
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:36,334
Mr. Brand,
calling Mr. Brand.

84
00:03:36,335 --> 00:03:39,251
Message for Mr. Brand
at the information desk.

85
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:40,817
Hello, Curtis?
This is Honeyman.

86
00:03:40,818 --> 00:03:42,514
Say, I thought you said
this deal was undercover.

87
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:43,995
Oh is that so?

88
00:03:43,996 --> 00:03:45,474
Well, do you know
who's on this plane?

89
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,911
Brand.

90
00:03:46,954 --> 00:03:48,913
Brand, of Cold Ammunition.

91
00:03:48,914 --> 00:03:52,524
Sure, there's a fortune at stake
if he doesn't start cutting prices.

92
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:55,005
If he does, I'll cut his
throat, and I'm not kidding.

93
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:56,355
Who?

94
00:03:56,356 --> 00:03:57,355
Senator Corey?

95
00:03:57,356 --> 00:03:58,749
On this plane?

96
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:02,144
Say, if I can get to him
before Brand... right.

97
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:04,146
I'll cable you.

98
00:04:04,147 --> 00:04:06,190
Sea Bird will
leave promptly at 5:00.

99
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:08,149
One more passenger, Robert Malone.

100
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,673
He called from Albuquerque,
be here on time.

101
00:04:10,674 --> 00:04:11,849
Mr. Malone?

102
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,690
Calling Mr. Malone, please
report at once to registration desk.

103
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,130
Say, you fellas weren't
going to leave me.

104
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:35,132
We thought possibly you'd
been delayed, Mr. Malone.

105
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:36,221
Delayed?

106
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:37,178
Now whatever made you think that?

107
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:38,179
All aboard, Mr. Malone.

108
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,267
Happy landings...

109
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:40,268
So long, Jim.

110
00:05:40,078 --> 00:05:41,298
Feeling badly, sir?

111
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,080
Son, if I felt any
better, I'd sing.

112
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:45,082
And then you'd be
sorry you mentioned it.

113
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,519
Sorry I did.

114
00:06:01,534 --> 00:06:04,450
Uh, there seems to
be many hours ahead.

115
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:05,841
Maybe we should get acquainted.

116
00:06:05,842 --> 00:06:07,017
I'm John P. Corey,
formerly state senator.

117
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:08,976
I'm merely Ms. Bailey.

118
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,108
Oh, indeed.

119
00:06:10,109 --> 00:06:11,673
We at the nation's helm have done

120
00:06:11,674 --> 00:06:14,242
a great work for modern transportation,
don't you think?

121
00:06:14,243 --> 00:06:15,851
We've made this ocean a... pond

122
00:06:15,852 --> 00:06:16,983
and the whole world our neighbors.

123
00:06:16,984 --> 00:06:18,594
Can I say more?

124
00:06:19,195 --> 00:06:20,465
I hope not, Senator.

125
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:21,422
It's too funny as it is.

126
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:22,903
Don't spoil it.

127
00:06:31,912 --> 00:06:34,349
Well, Harrison Brand.

128
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,872
This is a coincidence.

129
00:06:35,873 --> 00:06:36,916
Hello, Honeyman.

130
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:37,699
Pleasure trip?

131
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,137
And what a pleasure.

132
00:06:39,138 --> 00:06:41,225
It will be a honeymoon if
I meet the right party.

133
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:42,705
Oh, that's fine.

134
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:45,708
And if you don't meet
the right party, I will.

135
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:47,710
Ah, that's quite a bet.

136
00:06:47,754 --> 00:06:48,885
Hang on to that.

137
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:58,765
It's very beautiful, isn't it?

138
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:00,548
Well, look, my name is Malone.

139
00:07:00,549 --> 00:07:02,464
Does it make you happy?

140
00:07:02,508 --> 00:07:05,685
Honolulu, Hong Kong,
or Shanghai, kid?

141
00:07:05,686 --> 00:07:06,511
Shanghai.

142
00:07:06,512 --> 00:07:07,381
Health?

143
00:07:07,382 --> 00:07:09,994
No, vacation by request.

144
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:12,996
Then you and I better knock off a
few hours without boring each other.

145
00:07:12,997 --> 00:07:14,302
What's your racket?

146
00:07:14,346 --> 00:07:15,347
Besides health.

147
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,565
Me?

148
00:07:16,566 --> 00:07:19,915
I'm a forgotten man, trying to
make myself a little more forgotten.

149
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,353
On the lam?

150
00:07:21,396 --> 00:07:26,010
Don't be seductive, but
I'm not exactly on parade.

151
00:07:26,047 --> 00:07:29,577
Well, I suppose you're one
of our country's enterprising

152
00:07:29,578 --> 00:07:32,276
young men, travelling the
world for new business.

153
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:33,973
Perhaps you'll make
a fourth at bridge.

154
00:07:33,974 --> 00:07:34,974
Cards for money?

155
00:07:34,975 --> 00:07:37,238
Why, that would be gambling.

156
00:07:39,312 --> 00:07:42,112
Say, we seem to be two
of a kind on this deal.

157
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:43,156
Let's keep it that way.

158
00:07:43,157 --> 00:07:44,940
Well, don't get your face red.

159
00:07:44,941 --> 00:07:46,116
This is a long trip.

160
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:48,293
We both have a lot to think about.

161
00:07:48,294 --> 00:07:49,815
Let's hold everything
under control.

162
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:52,427
Sure, that's OK.

163
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:56,083
Say, you seem to be pretty regular.

164
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:58,085
You're regular too.

165
00:07:58,086 --> 00:07:59,564
Radiogram for you, Ms. Bailey.

166
00:07:59,565 --> 00:08:01,045
Excuse me.

167
00:08:12,262 --> 00:08:13,350
No answer.

168
00:08:13,394 --> 00:08:15,309
I bid one club...

169
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,399
Oh.

170
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,315
I'm so sorry.

171
00:08:21,358 --> 00:08:23,273
Oh, let me...

172
00:08:23,317 --> 00:08:25,231
Oh, I'm sorry.

173
00:08:25,275 --> 00:08:27,190
I must be very awkward.

174
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:29,192
Or perhaps the ship is.

175
00:08:29,235 --> 00:08:30,672
It's the ship.

176
00:08:30,673 --> 00:08:32,368
Have you made the trip before?

177
00:08:32,369 --> 00:08:34,805
No, and I think this once
will close the book for me.

178
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:35,676
And you?

179
00:08:35,677 --> 00:08:37,113
My first trip too.

180
00:08:37,114 --> 00:08:39,114
I think women have
more courage than men.

181
00:08:39,115 --> 00:08:41,116
I think you've got
something there, Mother.

182
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:42,596
You can't prove it by me.

183
00:08:42,597 --> 00:08:44,554
I always defend men
when I'm with women.

184
00:08:44,555 --> 00:08:47,470
Men are a strange lot, but
they're useful sometimes.

185
00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:48,471
There are some good ones.

186
00:08:48,472 --> 00:08:49,560
My son is one.

187
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:50,430
Your son is in China?

188
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,562
Yes.

189
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:52,606
I haven't seen him in five years.

190
00:08:52,607 --> 00:08:53,781
He doesn't know I'm coming.

191
00:08:53,782 --> 00:08:55,217
Oh, no wonder you're so excited.

192
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:56,610
It will be a great
surprise for him.

193
00:08:56,611 --> 00:08:58,089
He hasn't written
me in over a year,

194
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:00,440
but I suppose with all
the trouble over there,

195
00:09:00,441 --> 00:09:02,093
he's been very busy
helping settle it.

196
00:09:02,094 --> 00:09:03,534
He must be very clever.

197
00:09:03,574 --> 00:09:05,054
He is.

198
00:09:05,097 --> 00:09:06,882
Oh, I'm sorry.

199
00:09:06,883 --> 00:09:08,099
I may be boring you.

200
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,406
No, not at all.

201
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:10,711
Would you like me
to tell your fortune?

202
00:09:10,712 --> 00:09:11,799
I read the cards, you know.

203
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,148
Oh, I don't believe in that.

204
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:15,498
You may not believe
in it, young woman,

205
00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:18,458
but it's very funny how often the
things we see in cards come true.

206
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:20,417
Cut three times, please.

207
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:23,985
You're married.

208
00:09:23,986 --> 00:09:25,291
What?

209
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:27,772
You're returning to
a dark man in China.

210
00:09:27,773 --> 00:09:29,643
Maybe I didn't cut the cards right.

211
00:09:29,644 --> 00:09:31,036
Oh, yes.

212
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,472
Here's another man, very
much in love with you.

213
00:09:32,473 --> 00:09:33,430
No.

214
00:09:33,431 --> 00:09:34,909
That card is never wrong.

215
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,953
It always spells romance.

216
00:09:35,954 --> 00:09:37,564
There he is again, the same man.

217
00:09:37,565 --> 00:09:38,956
Maybe it's the altitude.

218
00:09:38,957 --> 00:09:41,438
No, I'm sure it's a man.

219
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:42,918
Isn't there always?

220
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,397
That's what's wrong with the world.

221
00:09:44,398 --> 00:09:46,269
No more men in my life.

222
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,749
Oh, steward, aren't we
over the Japanese current?

223
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,229
Why, yes.

224
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,274
You must be an
experienced traveler.

225
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:53,494
Oh, no.

226
00:09:53,495 --> 00:09:55,233
I've never been near
the ocean before.

227
00:09:55,234 --> 00:09:56,800
Well, how did you know then?

228
00:09:56,801 --> 00:09:59,194
One learns a great many
things in 50 years, young man,

229
00:09:59,195 --> 00:10:02,590
some of them very strange.

230
00:10:02,591 --> 00:10:04,634
Do you have to wait
until you're 50?

231
00:10:04,635 --> 00:10:07,072
Oh, look at the clouds.

232
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:10,623
They look like strange worlds
where anything might happen.

233
00:10:31,272 --> 00:10:32,532
I don't believe it.

234
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:33,533
Oh, yes.

235
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:34,984
It's very interesting.

236
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:37,146
This is the sunken...

237
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:38,452
We're over it now.

238
00:10:38,453 --> 00:10:40,453
That's how ancient
America was joined.

239
00:10:40,454 --> 00:10:44,224
Right below us this moment there
was a very high civilization.

240
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,850
I think we must be
off course a little.

241
00:10:46,851 --> 00:10:48,809
Officer aren't we off our course?

242
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,507
Why, no, madam.

243
00:10:50,508 --> 00:10:53,554
That is not more than one or two
degrees, of course nothing serious.

244
00:10:53,555 --> 00:10:55,468
One or two degrees is quite a lot.

245
00:10:55,469 --> 00:10:57,470
I think we're coming into a storm.

246
00:10:57,471 --> 00:10:58,646
Oh, ridiculous.

247
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:02,388
Why, my dear lady,
it's all sunshine.

248
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:06,087
You were right, Mrs. Sydney.

249
00:11:06,088 --> 00:11:07,828
Maybe you can tell us when
we're going to come out of it.

250
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:10,527
We haven't really
gotten into it yet.

251
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:12,486
That's very encouraging.

252
00:11:35,538 --> 00:11:37,858
Sea Bird calling Coral Island.

253
00:11:37,859 --> 00:11:40,339
Pacific Sea Bird
calling Coral Island.

254
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:42,341
16703.

255
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:46,781
Approximate position,
north 22, west 143.

256
00:11:46,824 --> 00:11:50,262
Ceiling closing in fast.

257
00:11:50,306 --> 00:11:53,265
Coral Island calling Sea Bird.

258
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:55,703
Coral Island calling Sea Bird.

259
00:11:59,271 --> 00:12:01,665
Coral Island calling Sea Bird.

260
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:03,667
Coral Island calling Sea Bird.

261
00:12:03,668 --> 00:12:04,711
They can't hear us.

262
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:06,670
I can't get through.

263
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:14,155
Pacific Sea Bird
calling Coral Island.

264
00:12:14,156 --> 00:12:16,536
Pacific Sea Bird
calling Coral Island.

265
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,075
The lights are off.

266
00:12:26,383 --> 00:12:27,603
Come on, everybody.

267
00:12:27,604 --> 00:12:29,563
Now take it easy.

268
00:12:29,564 --> 00:12:31,085
Oh, is there any actual danger?

269
00:12:31,086 --> 00:12:32,739
We're trying to fly
around the storm.

270
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,566
There's no danger.

271
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:36,004
Don't worry.

272
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,047
Don't lose your nerve.

273
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,484
Steward, steward.

274
00:12:38,528 --> 00:12:39,528
Yes sir?

275
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:40,748
What's happening?

276
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:42,009
I demand to know,
why are we falling?

277
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,401
Well, sir, it's like this.

278
00:12:43,402 --> 00:12:44,664
Sometimes we go up,
sometimes we come down.

279
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:46,404
- Are you trying to be funny?
- Yes.

280
00:12:46,405 --> 00:12:47,405
How am I doing?

281
00:12:47,572 --> 00:12:49,712
Don't be frightened,
Mrs. Sydney.

282
00:12:49,713 --> 00:12:50,974
I'm not frightened.

283
00:12:50,975 --> 00:12:52,193
But should we put
on the life vests?

284
00:12:52,194 --> 00:12:53,325
No.

285
00:12:53,326 --> 00:12:55,516
They'll tell us if it's necessary.

286
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,680
We can't waste anything.

287
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:02,159
Keep trying, keep trying.

288
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Where are we?

289
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:05,120
We're 10 degrees off course.

290
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:07,078
Fine navigation.

291
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,501
Hey, hey.

292
00:13:39,545 --> 00:13:43,462
Let me out of here.

293
00:14:09,314 --> 00:14:10,751
We're going to crash.

294
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:29,769
Now stand back, everybody.

295
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,110
I'll shoot the first one
that tries to open that door.

296
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,907
Are you feeling any
better, Mrs. Sydney?

297
00:15:20,908 --> 00:15:21,951
I'm all right, dear.

298
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:23,170
Don't worry too much about me.

299
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:24,607
Take care of yourself.

300
00:15:24,608 --> 00:15:26,042
You'll need your strength.

301
00:15:26,043 --> 00:15:27,261
No sign of life anywhere.

302
00:15:27,262 --> 00:15:28,653
Not a living thing, man or beast.

303
00:15:28,654 --> 00:15:29,612
Where are we?

304
00:15:29,613 --> 00:15:30,612
That's what I want to know.

305
00:15:30,613 --> 00:15:31,961
It's gross mismanagement.

306
00:15:31,962 --> 00:15:35,182
I should insist upon an
investigation immediately I return.

307
00:15:35,183 --> 00:15:35,965
Hm.

308
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:37,663
Good idea, Senator.

309
00:15:37,664 --> 00:15:38,751
When you figure out exactly
how you're going to get back,

310
00:15:38,752 --> 00:15:40,362
will you let us in on it?

311
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:42,668
Boy, boy, where are we anyway?

312
00:15:42,669 --> 00:15:44,669
As far as I can make
out we're nowhere.

313
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,714
Where are the officers?

314
00:15:45,715 --> 00:15:47,150
They went down with the ship.

315
00:15:47,151 --> 00:15:48,848
I guess the door must have stuck.

316
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:50,589
Oh, that's too bad.

317
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,634
I'm very sorry, but here we are
cast on an uninhabited island.

318
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:54,245
It's unprecedented.

319
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:55,463
Oh, is that what it is?

320
00:15:55,464 --> 00:15:57,205
This is pretty funny.

321
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,120
I was trying to run away
from a nervous breakdown.

322
00:16:00,121 --> 00:16:01,164
Now listen, everybody.

323
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:02,600
There's no use getting excited.

324
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:03,776
There might be a town
right around the corner.

325
00:16:03,777 --> 00:16:05,300
Good.

326
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:06,779
The least you can do is to
try to find some shelter.

327
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,010
Lady, I lost my
job a few hours ago.

328
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,260
I'll do my share and no more.

329
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,741
Now, see here...

330
00:16:11,742 --> 00:16:13,568
Make out a report for the
investigating committee,

331
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:14,570
Blubberpus.

332
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:16,223
We're all in the same boat now.

333
00:16:16,224 --> 00:16:17,224
Cheer up everybody.

334
00:16:17,225 --> 00:16:18,573
This is a pretty nice place.

335
00:16:18,574 --> 00:16:20,009
There's nothing to worry about.

336
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:20,967
Yet.

337
00:16:20,968 --> 00:16:23,187
Just one big happy family.

338
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:24,797
Hey, what is that over there?

339
00:16:24,798 --> 00:16:26,234
Isn't that smoke?

340
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,758
Sure it's smoke.

341
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,803
Well, what are we
wasting our time for?

342
00:16:30,804 --> 00:16:32,024
Let's investigate.

343
00:16:37,978 --> 00:16:39,768
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

344
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:40,900
What is it?
What is it?

345
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:41,726
Do you see anybody?

346
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,164
Oh, shut up.

347
00:16:54,044 --> 00:16:56,438
It looks creepy to me.

348
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:57,873
Lay off that gun, will you?

349
00:16:57,874 --> 00:16:59,309
You'll start eating with
it one of these days

350
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,660
and it will blow your head off.

351
00:17:01,661 --> 00:17:02,486
All right, look out.

352
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:04,446
Look out.

353
00:17:28,644 --> 00:17:31,647
Young man, who are you?

354
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,867
Suppose I ask the questions.

355
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:34,736
What is this place?

356
00:17:34,737 --> 00:17:36,260
Where are we?

357
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:39,349
About 1,200 miles off the
nearest ship or air lane.

358
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,308
Enjoy privacy?

359
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,308
You'll like it here.

360
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:42,309
Are you alone here?

361
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,311
I was.

362
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,094
Say pal, what about some food?

363
00:17:45,095 --> 00:17:47,575
We dropped out of the sky
last night in a burning plane.

364
00:17:47,576 --> 00:17:50,274
I guess we're what
you'd call survivors.

365
00:17:50,318 --> 00:17:51,928
Where are the officers?

366
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:53,537
Well, they went down with
the plane, the poor fellas.

367
00:17:53,538 --> 00:17:55,539
We want transportation at
once to the nearest port.

368
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,323
I'm sure you do.

369
00:17:56,324 --> 00:17:57,106
How about a boat?

370
00:17:57,107 --> 00:17:58,108
Sorry.

371
00:17:58,145 --> 00:17:59,935
How far are we from Shanghai?

372
00:17:59,936 --> 00:18:01,285
1,500 miles.

373
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:03,418
Do any boats ever stop here?

374
00:18:03,461 --> 00:18:06,116
No, but I've only been here a year.

375
00:18:06,117 --> 00:18:08,030
We must get away somehow.

376
00:18:08,031 --> 00:18:11,687
Look, there's a boat.

377
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,298
Don't get excited, it's mine.

378
00:18:14,342 --> 00:18:17,040
I thought you said
you didn't have a boat.

379
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,649
I said you didn't have a boat.

380
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,087
Now just a minute.

381
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:22,001
Are we to understand that
you refuse to pilot us?

382
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:23,654
Don't you think a good breakfast

383
00:18:23,655 --> 00:18:25,134
would uh, be about the most
important thing right now?

384
00:18:25,135 --> 00:18:28,137
That's the most sensible
thing that's been said yet.

385
00:18:28,138 --> 00:18:30,227
If you'll excuse me.

386
00:18:45,634 --> 00:18:48,071
Mr. Taylor, sir.

387
00:18:48,072 --> 00:18:49,245
- Any more coconut milk?
- No.

388
00:18:49,246 --> 00:18:50,639
- No thanks.
- No.

389
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,769
- I'm all right.
- Not a bad meal, do you think?

390
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,075
- Oh, lovely.
- Excellent.

391
00:18:53,076 --> 00:18:54,816
It may have served
its purpose, Mr Taylor,

392
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:55,991
but now let's get down to business.

393
00:18:55,992 --> 00:18:57,211
- Business?
- Yes.

394
00:18:57,212 --> 00:18:58,211
You must be reasonable.

395
00:18:58,212 --> 00:18:59,822
- Why?
- Why?

396
00:18:59,823 --> 00:19:01,040
Don't be ridiculous.

397
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,302
Why should any man be reasonable?

398
00:19:02,303 --> 00:19:03,477
I'm sure I don't know.

399
00:19:03,478 --> 00:19:05,044
You seem to resent our coming here.

400
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:06,394
I most certainly do.

401
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,048
Oh, obviously it's not
through our own choice.

402
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:10,441
I imagine not.

403
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:13,530
Why won't you take us to the mainland,
apart from your inconvenience?

404
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:14,749
Let's say that is the reason.

405
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,272
Man alive, can't you understand?

406
00:19:16,273 --> 00:19:17,578
We are people of affairs.

407
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:19,232
We have missions in this world.

408
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:21,974
Now, now, Senator, you're
taking yourself too seriously.

409
00:19:21,975 --> 00:19:24,741
But really, Mr. Taylor,
it's the only decent thing you can do.

410
00:19:24,742 --> 00:19:26,065
- Decent?
- Yes.

411
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:27,284
Decent.

412
00:19:27,285 --> 00:19:28,502
What's to prevent
our taking the boat?

413
00:19:28,503 --> 00:19:30,025
There's a navigator in the club?

414
00:19:30,026 --> 00:19:32,115
I think I can read a compass.

415
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:33,464
I think.

416
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:36,814
Well, if you think you can navigate
1,000 miles of treacherous sea, why...

417
00:19:36,815 --> 00:19:39,992
Is it possible that your man,
Mr. Ping, can sail the boat?

418
00:19:39,993 --> 00:19:41,820
Yes, he can.

419
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:43,251
But he's not going to.

420
00:19:43,672 --> 00:19:47,042
Now look here, let's understand
each other thoroughly.

421
00:19:47,043 --> 00:19:49,740
You want to get to your
destinations for reasons of your own.

422
00:19:49,741 --> 00:19:51,960
I refuse to take you
for reasons of my own.

423
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:54,267
That I have personal
reasons goes without saying

424
00:19:54,268 --> 00:19:55,964
and I don't want any more probing.

425
00:19:55,965 --> 00:19:58,706
I didn't invite you here,
but as long as you are here

426
00:19:58,707 --> 00:20:03,929
I'll do my best to treat you as guests,
only as long as you act as guests.

427
00:20:03,973 --> 00:20:05,192
Is that clear?

428
00:20:05,235 --> 00:20:08,282
Mr. Taylor, time
for news bulletin.

429
00:20:08,283 --> 00:20:09,717
Put it on, Ping.

430
00:20:09,718 --> 00:20:10,893
A radio?

431
00:20:10,936 --> 00:20:13,076
Just an old fashioned battery set.

432
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:18,639
And with talks of the borders,
all central Europe is tense awaiting

433
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,550
the next move of the dictators.

434
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:23,948
We now swing across from central Europe
to somewhere in the Pacific Ocean

435
00:20:23,949 --> 00:20:27,561
where the mystery of the giant
plane Sea Bird is cloaked in silence.

436
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:29,476
Although hope has
not been abandoned,

437
00:20:29,477 --> 00:20:31,608
it is considered almost
certain that the plane

438
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:34,379
and all its occupants
went down into the sea.

439
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,004
We formally broadcast the identity

440
00:20:36,005 --> 00:20:38,746
of those aboard with the
exception of three passengers.

441
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:42,271
They have now been established
through dispatches from San Francisco.

442
00:20:42,272 --> 00:20:44,273
Traveling aboard
the plane incognito

443
00:20:44,274 --> 00:20:48,235
under the name of Doris
Bailey was Ms. Thelma Chase,

444
00:20:48,236 --> 00:20:52,108
heiress to the Chase millions and one
of the richest girls in the world.

445
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:54,544
It is said that she was going
abroad to absent herself

446
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,764
from the growing labor troubles
in one of her factories

447
00:20:56,765 --> 00:20:58,548
which is now closed by strikes.

448
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:01,247
Another on the plane was Robert
Malone, known in the underworld

449
00:21:01,248 --> 00:21:06,992
as the Torpedo, a former member
of the notorious Dot Swanson gang.

450
00:21:06,993 --> 00:21:09,690
Malone was fleeing to the Orient
with $150,000 which he had held

451
00:21:09,691 --> 00:21:11,606
back from some gang operation.

452
00:21:11,607 --> 00:21:14,121
The reason for his hasty
flight was said that

453
00:21:14,122 --> 00:21:17,150
he had been marked for death
by his fellow mobsters.

454
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,220
Also on the plane...

455
00:21:18,221 --> 00:21:19,353
Take it easy.

456
00:21:19,354 --> 00:21:22,268
Was Iris Compton, who was being sought
by the District Attorney's office

457
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:25,184
for questioning regarding her
knowledge of underworld activities.

458
00:21:25,185 --> 00:21:26,881
Newspaper men allege that she was

459
00:21:26,882 --> 00:21:29,492
ordered to leave the city until
the investigation blew over.

460
00:21:29,493 --> 00:21:32,713
Harrison Brand and T.L Honeyman,
whose identity was reported

461
00:21:32,714 --> 00:21:35,214
before, were ammunition
salesmen for two

462
00:21:35,238 --> 00:21:38,676
unnamed competitive firms,
both hastening to the Orient

463
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,790
to close gigantic deals
on the sale of ammunition.

464
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:45,160
And this brings to a close our
news broadcast for this evening.

465
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:47,859
The program comes to you...

466
00:21:47,903 --> 00:21:50,471
That makes at least
three murderers.

467
00:21:50,472 --> 00:21:53,821
Ladies and gentlemen, now we're
really getting acquainted.

468
00:21:53,822 --> 00:21:56,040
It seems to me, Ms. Compton,
that from now on, out

469
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,259
of respect for these ladies...

470
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,696
Senator, you shut up.

471
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,656
I advise you to take
that advice, Senator.

472
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:03,397
You too, Malone.

473
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,270
Mr. Taylor, I'll give you
$100,000 to take me to China.

474
00:22:07,271 --> 00:22:08,357
You mean just you?

475
00:22:08,358 --> 00:22:09,880
I can't speak for the others.

476
00:22:09,881 --> 00:22:13,407
You can put me down for 50 G's
and another $50,000 for Ms. Compton.

477
00:22:13,408 --> 00:22:15,477
Thanks buddy, that's
very thoughtful.

478
00:22:15,478 --> 00:22:17,261
That's splitting the bank
roll with you two to one.

479
00:22:17,262 --> 00:22:19,655
I need the last $50,000
to get started again.

480
00:22:19,656 --> 00:22:21,657
How much Ms. Chase
has offered, Taylor,

481
00:22:21,658 --> 00:22:24,443
but you'll have to wait until
I put over this deal in China.

482
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:26,923
That is if the senator
here lends proper influence.

483
00:22:26,924 --> 00:22:29,709
Well, if it's that kind
of a deal, I'll double it.

484
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,799
Oh, Senator, here's your chance.

485
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,148
These gentlemen are insinuating
that your help can help

486
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:35,454
put over their ammunition deal.

487
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:39,372
Of course the thousands of lives
involved wouldn't matter to you.

488
00:22:39,373 --> 00:22:42,549
Really, gentleman, you, you put
me in a very embarrassing position.

489
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,984
I don't know what
you're talking about.

490
00:22:43,985 --> 00:22:46,814
I don't think you
told me who you are.

491
00:22:46,857 --> 00:22:50,339
I'm a nurse returning to
China for humanitarian reasons.

492
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,514
Of course I realize that
means nothing to you.

493
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:53,820
Are you a graduate nurse?

494
00:22:53,821 --> 00:22:54,648
Yes.

495
00:22:54,649 --> 00:22:55,561
Been in China before?

496
00:22:55,562 --> 00:22:56,954
Yes.

497
00:22:56,955 --> 00:22:58,041
In what hospital?

498
00:22:58,042 --> 00:22:59,913
The Lady of the Lamp in Kuchow.

499
00:22:59,914 --> 00:23:01,350
Why?

500
00:23:01,394 --> 00:23:03,265
Oh, just curious.

501
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:04,091
Well?

502
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:06,573
What about it?

503
00:23:06,574 --> 00:23:09,009
I'm sorry to inconvenience
Mrs. Sydney and Mrs. Wesson,

504
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,576
but I'm not taking any of you.

505
00:23:10,577 --> 00:23:12,316
If you think you're going
to keep us on this island

506
00:23:12,317 --> 00:23:13,840
while there's a boat around
that will sail, you're crazy.

507
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:15,059
Why get excited?

508
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,322
We don't care much where we're going,
as long as it isn't back.

509
00:23:18,323 --> 00:23:20,935
Now there's just one
other little thing.

510
00:23:20,936 --> 00:23:23,023
When I arrived on this
island, the first thing I did

511
00:23:23,024 --> 00:23:26,113
was to build this shack and
then I began scouting for food.

512
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:27,549
If you think you're
going to run this island

513
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,942
and tell me what
you'd like for dinner,

514
00:23:28,943 --> 00:23:31,118
you'd better try and
think up another idea.

515
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,120
I'm not running a rest
camp for nervous patients

516
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:34,904
and I'm a little sick of
answering silly questions.

517
00:23:34,905 --> 00:23:38,735
To live on this island, two things
are necessary, food and shelter.

518
00:23:38,736 --> 00:23:42,042
And from now on if you want either,
you'll have to find your own.

519
00:23:42,043 --> 00:23:43,784
I prefer my own company.

520
00:23:43,827 --> 00:23:47,222
He means we're very welcome, folks.

521
00:24:19,036 --> 00:24:20,342
Dinner's served.

522
00:24:24,418 --> 00:24:27,348
Are we going to let this
man get away with this?

523
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:28,349
We've got a right to eat.

524
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,525
I'll talk to him.

525
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:31,005
Talk?

526
00:24:44,235 --> 00:24:46,455
Oh, did you want something?

527
00:24:46,499 --> 00:24:51,895
Now, look here, Mr. Taylor, we're
perfectly willing to pay for the food.

528
00:24:51,896 --> 00:24:54,723
I'm sorry, Senator, but
your money is no good here.

529
00:24:54,724 --> 00:24:57,945
I'm quite willing to let
you use my fishing tackle.

530
00:24:57,946 --> 00:24:59,467
In fact, I might even
stretch it a bit.

531
00:24:59,468 --> 00:25:00,947
I'll give you some of my fish.

532
00:25:00,948 --> 00:25:02,427
Oh no, not this one.

533
00:25:02,471 --> 00:25:04,125
Oh.

534
00:25:04,126 --> 00:25:06,387
But you'll have to
cook them yourselves.

535
00:25:06,388 --> 00:25:07,693
Oh, I, I don't mind that.

536
00:25:07,694 --> 00:25:09,434
Can anybody cook?

537
00:25:09,435 --> 00:25:12,785
And one other thing, if you
don't clean up afterwards,

538
00:25:12,786 --> 00:25:14,482
you can't use my fireplace again.

539
00:25:14,483 --> 00:25:15,831
I'll see to that too.

540
00:25:15,832 --> 00:25:17,485
And you'll have to
gather your own firewood.

541
00:25:17,486 --> 00:25:18,268
Oh.

542
00:25:18,269 --> 00:25:19,749
They will.

543
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,271
You'll find the fish outside
under the damp leaves.

544
00:25:21,272 --> 00:25:22,272
Whoa.

545
00:25:22,273 --> 00:25:23,187
Take it easy.

546
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,188
Wait a minute.

547
00:25:24,885 --> 00:25:25,885
Take it easy.

548
00:25:39,934 --> 00:25:41,944
What we going to
do, Mr. Taylor?

549
00:25:41,945 --> 00:25:43,599
I don't know.

550
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,861
I'm just as anxious to get
rid of them as they are to go.

551
00:25:45,862 --> 00:25:47,777
We stay, they swim.

552
00:25:47,778 --> 00:25:48,821
You no take chance.

553
00:25:48,822 --> 00:25:51,259
You can't go back.

554
00:25:51,302 --> 00:25:53,217
I know that, Ping.

555
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:55,231
Very well, set it here.

556
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:57,657
We must all cooperate.

557
00:25:57,658 --> 00:25:59,179
Ah, very clever of you girls.

558
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,007
I'm very fond of...

559
00:26:01,008 --> 00:26:03,923
Now, let's go about this in
organized, democratic fashion.

560
00:26:03,924 --> 00:26:04,924
We'll divide up the work.

561
00:26:04,925 --> 00:26:06,099
Mrs. Sydney, can you cook?

562
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,840
I've been frying fish for 30 years.

563
00:26:07,841 --> 00:26:09,190
Fine, fine.

564
00:26:09,191 --> 00:26:10,451
Uh, Jessup, you can
prepare the vegetables.

565
00:26:10,452 --> 00:26:11,931
Malone, uh, you can clean the fish.

566
00:26:11,932 --> 00:26:13,672
Ms. Thelma Chase may serve
the meal, if you will,

567
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:15,630
and Mrs. Wesson, you
can clean up afterwards.

568
00:26:15,631 --> 00:26:17,066
Brand and Honeyman, you
can gather the wood.

569
00:26:17,067 --> 00:26:18,590
There now, that's democratic.

570
00:26:18,591 --> 00:26:20,592
Outside of eating, Senator,
just what do you do?

571
00:26:20,593 --> 00:26:21,593
Why, I'm the organizer.

572
00:26:21,594 --> 00:26:23,378
Well, who elected you?

573
00:26:23,379 --> 00:26:25,503
If this is going to be democratic,
let's have an election.

574
00:26:25,504 --> 00:26:26,101
Here, here.

575
00:26:26,102 --> 00:26:27,208
Yeah.

576
00:26:27,209 --> 00:26:28,425
I nominate the Senator
to clean the fish.

577
00:26:28,426 --> 00:26:30,037
Wait just a minute now...

578
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:31,385
I'll second the motion that
the Senator cleans the fish.

579
00:26:31,386 --> 00:26:32,822
- All in favor?
- Aye.

580
00:26:32,866 --> 00:26:33,997
- Against?
- Aye.

581
00:26:34,824 --> 00:26:35,824
I protest.

582
00:26:35,825 --> 00:26:37,261
Overruled.

583
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,784
This is against all
conceptions of democracy.

584
00:26:38,785 --> 00:26:40,307
It's a virtual, a
virtual dictatorship.

585
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:41,918
On the contrary, Senator.

586
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:42,831
It's perfect democracy.

587
00:26:42,832 --> 00:26:44,224
The voice of the people.

588
00:26:44,225 --> 00:26:46,975
If you don't clean the
fish, you don't eat.

589
00:27:13,471 --> 00:27:15,430
You can't come in here.

590
00:27:15,473 --> 00:27:17,562
Oh, fancy finding you here.

591
00:27:17,563 --> 00:27:18,563
Go away.

592
00:27:18,564 --> 00:27:19,607
I thought this was my boat.

593
00:27:19,608 --> 00:27:20,826
Maybe I'm wrong.
Come on out.

594
00:27:20,827 --> 00:27:21,696
I can't.

595
00:27:21,697 --> 00:27:22,698
No?

596
00:27:22,699 --> 00:27:23,655
Here.

597
00:27:23,656 --> 00:27:25,701
Wrap yourself in this.

598
00:27:32,142 --> 00:27:33,143
Well?

599
00:27:33,144 --> 00:27:34,622
I was swimming and got tired.

600
00:27:34,623 --> 00:27:35,754
I stopped to rest.

601
00:27:35,755 --> 00:27:36,538
Good.

602
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:37,407
I'm glad to see you.

603
00:27:37,408 --> 00:27:38,496
Oh, really?

604
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:40,019
I've been waiting to talk to you.

605
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,542
Conscience been bothering you?

606
00:27:41,543 --> 00:27:42,586
You do have a conscience.

607
00:27:42,587 --> 00:27:43,937
Mm, a little.

608
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,520
Well, that's at least
one human quality.

609
00:27:46,521 --> 00:27:48,636
That was a pretty speech
you made last night.

610
00:27:48,637 --> 00:27:49,724
Wasn't it deserved?

611
00:27:49,725 --> 00:27:52,118
Maybe, but still you can't
expect us to accept it gratefully.

612
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:55,470
After all, our lives do
mean something to us.

613
00:27:55,471 --> 00:27:57,993
You don't think the men are
going to let you get away with it.

614
00:27:57,994 --> 00:27:59,429
Sorry, there's nothing
they can do about it.

615
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,910
Anyhow, I'd rather you
pleaded your own case.

616
00:28:01,911 --> 00:28:04,827
Well, I'd rather not.

617
00:28:04,828 --> 00:28:06,567
But what are you going
to do about Mrs. Sydney?

618
00:28:06,568 --> 00:28:08,613
She can't stand this place.

619
00:28:08,657 --> 00:28:09,919
That's too bad.

620
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,703
Well, it will be too bad for you

621
00:28:11,704 --> 00:28:14,270
if you don't save us because
we'll take the boat ourselves.

622
00:28:14,271 --> 00:28:16,925
Now, look here, young
lady, you're wasting

623
00:28:16,926 --> 00:28:18,361
your time inspecting this boat.

624
00:28:18,362 --> 00:28:21,495
I can tell you and all the others
everything you need to know.

625
00:28:21,496 --> 00:28:23,671
The magnete is hidden on the
island, so is the gasoline.

626
00:28:23,672 --> 00:28:26,456
And I don't think anybody can
handle sails, so I left that.

627
00:28:26,457 --> 00:28:28,764
And all the charts are hidden too.

628
00:28:28,765 --> 00:28:30,896
All right, Mr. Taylor, but if
you think you can keep eight

629
00:28:30,897 --> 00:28:32,811
people on this island when
you have the means of taking

630
00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:35,031
them away, you're crazy.

631
00:28:35,032 --> 00:28:36,659
Well, then,
if we keep on talking like this,

632
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,946
we're both going to get feverish.

633
00:28:37,947 --> 00:28:41,429
Come on, come on, let's go.

634
00:29:00,622 --> 00:29:02,624
What's on your mind, Ping?

635
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:04,407
I've been thinking, Mr. Taylor.

636
00:29:04,408 --> 00:29:06,019
You have?

637
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,760
Well, so have I, Ping, but
it hasn't gotten me anywhere.

638
00:29:08,761 --> 00:29:10,371
Keep Ping somewhere.

639
00:29:10,372 --> 00:29:13,286
Well, I've always said you
were a better thinker than I.

640
00:29:13,287 --> 00:29:14,592
Yes.

641
00:29:14,593 --> 00:29:16,245
Ping, these people
here, it's bad business.

642
00:29:16,246 --> 00:29:18,508
I wish we knew what
we could do about it.

643
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:19,422
They must go.

644
00:29:19,423 --> 00:29:20,555
Yes, but how?

645
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:26,821
I think there's something
in what you said, Ping.

646
00:29:26,822 --> 00:29:30,086
It's pretty risky, even
if we took a chance

647
00:29:30,087 --> 00:29:34,257
and dropped them off in an isolated
spot in the mainland at midnight.

648
00:29:37,572 --> 00:29:39,966
Catch the idea?

649
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:41,141
Thanks, Ping.

650
00:29:41,184 --> 00:29:43,314
That's probably a very good idea.

651
00:29:58,605 --> 00:30:01,725
Ladies and gentlemen, I
have some sad news for you.

652
00:30:01,726 --> 00:30:03,249
I've changed my mind.
You're leaving here.

653
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,860
- What?
- When?

654
00:30:04,861 --> 00:30:07,820
Well, young man, I'm glad you
see the path of decency at last.

655
00:30:07,821 --> 00:30:09,516
My conscience is stricken, Senator.

656
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:11,735
Mr. Honeyman and Mr. Brand
being kept from their noble work

657
00:30:11,736 --> 00:30:13,782
causes me sleepless nights.

658
00:30:13,783 --> 00:30:15,478
I can't stand it any longer.

659
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:19,092
And poor Ms. Chase, 30 millions
and no place to spend it.

660
00:30:19,135 --> 00:30:20,310
That's a tragedy.

661
00:30:21,355 --> 00:30:22,791
Can you pilot us?

662
00:30:22,835 --> 00:30:24,445
I'm not going.

663
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:26,272
My Chinese servant
will be your captain.

664
00:30:26,273 --> 00:30:28,970
However, there's just
one little difficulty.

665
00:30:28,971 --> 00:30:32,235
There are nine of you and
the boat only holds six.

666
00:30:32,236 --> 00:30:34,236
The rest of you will have
to wait about three months.

667
00:30:34,237 --> 00:30:36,151
Oh, well, the time will
soon pass for the others.

668
00:30:36,152 --> 00:30:40,102
Now, about the six, naturally
age comes first, then the ladies...

669
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:44,247
Please, quiet.

670
00:30:44,248 --> 00:30:46,509
There's nothing to be gained
by disorderly conduct.

671
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,598
Now, it's obvious
that the first to go

672
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:51,123
should be those whose objectives
are the most important.

673
00:30:51,124 --> 00:30:52,602
Certainly it's more
fitting that a lady like

674
00:30:52,603 --> 00:30:53,995
Ms. Chase should precede Ms...

675
00:30:53,996 --> 00:30:55,344
One more crack out of
you, Senator, and I'll...

676
00:30:55,345 --> 00:30:56,825
Forget it, will ya?

677
00:30:56,869 --> 00:30:58,000
Take that back.

678
00:30:58,001 --> 00:30:59,827
I'm, I'm sorry, Ms. Compton.

679
00:30:59,828 --> 00:31:01,264
I apologize.

680
00:31:01,265 --> 00:31:03,309
I was going to offer to
stay here, but that's out.

681
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:06,312
Well, if you're all through,
I'll give you my decision.

682
00:31:06,313 --> 00:31:08,444
Number one is Ping,
number two, Mrs. Sydney.

683
00:31:08,445 --> 00:31:10,533
Three and four, Ms.
Compton and Mr. Malone.

684
00:31:10,534 --> 00:31:12,362
Number five, Mrs. Wesson.

685
00:31:12,363 --> 00:31:14,015
But you said there were six.

686
00:31:14,016 --> 00:31:15,713
Yes, that's my difficulty.

687
00:31:15,714 --> 00:31:17,192
Let's see, there are four left.

688
00:31:17,193 --> 00:31:19,064
Well, I suppose we'll
have to toss for it.

689
00:31:19,065 --> 00:31:19,979
It's Jessup.

690
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,457
Well, I don't understand.

691
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:22,806
Why, this is absolutely...
one toss for four

692
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:24,286
people and then you... it's silly.

693
00:31:24,287 --> 00:31:26,854
Senator, I'm sorry, but
that's the way it is.

694
00:31:26,855 --> 00:31:27,899
Too bad, Ms. Chase.

695
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,987
You can't leave me here.

696
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:30,206
You simply can't.

697
00:31:30,207 --> 00:31:32,381
If that $100,000
lets you off with me,

698
00:31:32,382 --> 00:31:36,092
Ms. Chase, perhaps Ms. Compton
would take that for her place.

699
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:37,474
For three months?

700
00:31:37,518 --> 00:31:38,954
Yeah, that's fair.

701
00:31:38,955 --> 00:31:42,043
Now I can have that nervous breakdown
I've been putting off for years.

702
00:31:42,044 --> 00:31:43,828
Boy, will I enjoy it.

703
00:31:43,829 --> 00:31:45,742
Well, look everybody, when
you come right down to it,

704
00:31:45,743 --> 00:31:47,570
there's no particular rush
for me to leave this island.

705
00:31:47,571 --> 00:31:51,141
I mean, after all, what's three
months more or less to me?

706
00:31:51,556 --> 00:31:53,576
That's very fine of you, Malone.

707
00:31:53,577 --> 00:31:55,449
Well, that's settled.

708
00:31:55,492 --> 00:31:59,975
Oh, by the way, you
sail at noon tomorrow.

709
00:31:59,976 --> 00:32:01,845
You can't get away
with this, Taylor.

710
00:32:01,846 --> 00:32:02,759
Take it easy, Brand.

711
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,806
He won't.

712
00:32:04,807 --> 00:32:08,054
Your best course, Ping, will be to
avoid the Sermon group of islands.

713
00:32:08,055 --> 00:32:09,505
You understand the map?

714
00:32:09,506 --> 00:32:10,855
Yes, Mr. Taylor.

715
00:32:10,856 --> 00:32:12,204
It's going to be tough
taking five people.

716
00:32:12,205 --> 00:32:13,510
We make it.

717
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:14,728
Oh, run along now
and check everything.

718
00:32:14,729 --> 00:32:16,165
Yes, Mr. Taylor.

719
00:32:16,209 --> 00:32:19,125
Oh, hello, Mrs. Wesson.

720
00:32:19,168 --> 00:32:22,084
Your bags all packed?

721
00:32:22,085 --> 00:32:24,129
I wanted to thank
you, Mr. Taylor.

722
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,609
I've been doing you a great
injustice these past few days.

723
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,047
Mental murder?

724
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:30,005
Just about.

725
00:32:30,006 --> 00:32:31,571
I'm sorry you're not going with us.

726
00:32:31,572 --> 00:32:33,487
I'm sorry you're not staying.

727
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:36,011
You're a curious person.

728
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:39,536
I suppose all my life I've
been wondering who you are

729
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,409
and why you're on this island.

730
00:32:42,452 --> 00:32:44,411
It will be most irritating.

731
00:32:44,454 --> 00:32:47,631
You'll forget all about
this island the minute

732
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,675
you get back to civilization.

733
00:32:48,676 --> 00:32:50,634
I don't think so.

734
00:32:52,158 --> 00:32:53,594
Good bye.

735
00:32:53,637 --> 00:32:55,074
Good bye.

736
00:32:58,516 --> 00:33:02,036
Now, we don't want to pull
any strong-arm stuff, Taylor,

737
00:33:02,037 --> 00:33:04,952
but right here and now you're
going to listen to reason.

738
00:33:04,953 --> 00:33:05,909
I thought you understood me.

739
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:06,954
Well, that was your mistake.

740
00:33:06,955 --> 00:33:08,608
You're going to understand us.

741
00:33:08,609 --> 00:33:11,350
Listen, Taylor, you can't
set yourself up as a tin god.

742
00:33:11,351 --> 00:33:13,831
You either take us or we take you.

743
00:33:16,356 --> 00:33:17,356
Stop.

744
00:33:21,317 --> 00:33:24,799
Mr. Taylor, are you all right, Mr...

745
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,150
Sorry I couldn't get here earlier.

746
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:18,070
All right, you mugs,
take it on the lam.

747
00:34:18,071 --> 00:34:18,939
Thanks.

748
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,289
It's OK.

749
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,290
Hey, wouldn't it be a
riot if I had to become

750
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:25,338
the cop around this joint?

751
00:34:25,381 --> 00:34:27,427
Fine boys, Honeyman and Brand.

752
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,863
Very.

753
00:34:28,864 --> 00:34:30,994
You should find their company quite
enjoyable these next three months.

754
00:34:30,995 --> 00:34:32,300
Yeah, maybe I'll keep them here.

755
00:34:32,301 --> 00:34:34,085
You know, there's an idea in there.

756
00:34:34,086 --> 00:34:36,261
Quarantine all ammunition makers
and their salesman on an island

757
00:34:36,262 --> 00:34:37,523
and let them shoot it out.

758
00:34:37,524 --> 00:34:38,959
Do you ever do anything
with your ideas?

759
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,439
Oh, I just dream them up.

760
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,094
That's what I thought.

761
00:34:42,095 --> 00:34:43,877
Well, it's about time you
started putting them to work.

762
00:34:43,878 --> 00:34:44,921
Anything you say.

763
00:34:44,922 --> 00:34:46,575
Leave Honeyman and Brand here.

764
00:34:46,576 --> 00:34:50,362
You sail us instead of Ping and then
start kidnapping ammunition makers.

765
00:34:50,363 --> 00:34:51,189
I have a better idea.

766
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,147
Would it work?

767
00:34:52,148 --> 00:34:53,713
Well, that depends on you.

768
00:34:53,714 --> 00:34:55,845
Send Honeyman and Brand
back with Ping and you stay.

769
00:34:55,846 --> 00:34:56,672
Thanks.

770
00:34:56,673 --> 00:34:57,979
Oh seriously, Anne.

771
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,110
Why don't you let
someone else go and you

772
00:34:59,111 --> 00:35:00,415
stay till the boat comes back.

773
00:35:00,416 --> 00:35:01,764
We haven't begun to
know each other yet.

774
00:35:01,765 --> 00:35:03,071
Why should we?

775
00:35:03,072 --> 00:35:04,419
For the best reason in the world.

776
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,682
What's that?

777
00:35:05,726 --> 00:35:07,423
Because we want to.

778
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:09,947
Oh, do we?

779
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:38,150
Put 'em up, fish face.

780
00:35:38,193 --> 00:35:39,193
Don't shoot.

781
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:42,589
He's OK.

782
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,980
It's only his shoulder.

783
00:35:43,981 --> 00:35:44,851
Come on, get going.

784
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:45,809
Get in there.

785
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,020
Cast off that line.

786
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,229
Take that for luck.

787
00:36:15,056 --> 00:36:16,056
And that.

788
00:36:21,018 --> 00:36:23,891
Shut up, shut up.

789
00:36:25,371 --> 00:36:27,242
Mrs. Sydney.

790
00:36:31,203 --> 00:36:32,203
Is she?

791
00:36:32,204 --> 00:36:35,903
Is she hurt badly?

792
00:36:35,904 --> 00:36:37,599
It's nothing
serious, Mrs. Sydney.

793
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,992
We'll take you up to the shack
and fix you up right away.

794
00:36:38,993 --> 00:36:40,299
Give me...

795
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,560
All right, take it easy now, boys.

796
00:36:41,561 --> 00:36:42,343
Be careful.

797
00:36:42,344 --> 00:36:43,344
Be careful.

798
00:36:50,134 --> 00:36:51,614
Oh, shut up.

799
00:36:51,615 --> 00:36:53,093
We'll clean that cut
and fix you like new.

800
00:36:53,094 --> 00:36:55,095
All you got to do is be a good boy.

801
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:56,401
You want to make some
money, don't you?

802
00:36:56,402 --> 00:36:58,055
Yes sir.

803
00:36:58,056 --> 00:36:59,665
You bring us to the mainland,
and we'll give you $5,000.

804
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:01,841
That will make you the
richest Chinaman on the coast.

805
00:37:01,842 --> 00:37:02,798
What do you say?

806
00:37:02,799 --> 00:37:04,671
$5,000, lots of money.

807
00:37:04,672 --> 00:37:05,845
You're a smart boy.

808
00:37:05,846 --> 00:37:07,413
Well, can you beat this?

809
00:37:07,414 --> 00:37:09,805
And to think that guy Taylor
was pulling all that stuff

810
00:37:09,806 --> 00:37:11,459
about leading the
clean, simple life.

811
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,506
"The Shanghai News", get this.
"Convicted doctor escapes.

812
00:37:14,507 --> 00:37:17,466
Dr. James Taylor,
prominent Shanghai surgeon

813
00:37:17,467 --> 00:37:19,337
who was convicted of
murder in the first degree

814
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:22,950
for the slaying of Thomas
Sydney, a young American

815
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:25,081
connected with the underworld
escaped from prison last night

816
00:37:25,082 --> 00:37:26,954
aided by his Chinese servant."

817
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:27,910
That's me.

818
00:37:27,911 --> 00:37:30,957
"Police, however, fell
certain he will be captured

819
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:32,088
within the next 24 hours."

820
00:37:32,089 --> 00:37:33,308
When was that?

821
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:34,527
A year ago.

822
00:37:34,528 --> 00:37:36,354
I guess cops are
alike the world over.

823
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:37,877
Well, hey, you never can tell.

824
00:37:37,878 --> 00:37:39,835
There might be a reward
on that guy's head.

825
00:37:39,836 --> 00:37:42,316
Will find out when we
notify the authorities.

826
00:37:42,317 --> 00:37:45,625
I want to see that guy,
Mr. Dr. Taylor, in Shanghai

827
00:37:45,668 --> 00:37:47,366
when they bring him back.

828
00:37:57,267 --> 00:37:59,377
We'll put her on the bed in here.

829
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:01,815
Take it easy.

830
00:38:01,858 --> 00:38:04,774
Careful, easy, easy, easy.

831
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:08,777
The rest of you
wait outside, please.

832
00:38:08,778 --> 00:38:10,301
Malone, get that hot
water off the fire.

833
00:38:10,302 --> 00:38:12,781
Mrs. Wesson, you'll find
the kit on the table.

834
00:38:12,782 --> 00:38:14,352
The dressings are inside.

835
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:25,534
Mrs. Wesson.

836
00:38:25,535 --> 00:38:27,013
See where Malone
is with that water.

837
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:28,450
Yes, Doctor.

838
00:38:31,283 --> 00:38:34,063
Now, Mrs. Sydney, please
don't say anything.

839
00:38:34,064 --> 00:38:35,805
Thank you.

840
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:39,853
On that plane, remember,
I had a feeling this

841
00:38:39,854 --> 00:38:40,896
was going to be an adventure.

842
00:38:40,897 --> 00:38:41,767
Yes, that's right.

843
00:38:41,768 --> 00:38:42,550
You did.

844
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:43,900
Now please.

845
00:38:57,306 --> 00:38:58,306
I'm ready.

846
00:38:58,307 --> 00:38:59,654
Hold her head, Mrs. Wesson.

847
00:38:59,655 --> 00:39:01,787
Now, Mrs. Sydney,
just grit your teeth.

848
00:39:01,788 --> 00:39:03,978
I'm going to probe that bullet now.

849
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,750
She needs an anaesthetic, Doctor.

850
00:39:08,751 --> 00:39:10,405
We haven't any.

851
00:39:10,406 --> 00:39:12,450
I'm afraid it's too late anyway,
but we'll do what we can.

852
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:14,366
It is too late.

853
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,848
Don't worry about me.

854
00:39:18,892 --> 00:39:27,683
Seems as if I was right about
everything, except seeing my son again.

855
00:39:27,727 --> 00:39:31,165
Anne, will you tell him for me?

856
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:33,123
You find his picture.

857
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:36,083
His name is Thomas Sydney.

858
00:39:36,126 --> 00:39:38,085
Thomas Sydney?

859
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:39,085
Yes.

860
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:41,044
Did you know him?

861
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:45,309
Yes, I knew him.

862
00:39:45,353 --> 00:39:48,443
He's a very fine
boy, Mrs. Sydney.

863
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:49,487
I know.

864
00:39:53,753 --> 00:39:55,668
I know.

865
00:40:00,194 --> 00:40:03,589
Anne, please, please don't cry.

866
00:40:03,632 --> 00:40:05,591
Please.

867
00:40:12,396 --> 00:40:13,956
I'm awfully sorry, Anne.

868
00:40:13,957 --> 00:40:15,175
I'm afraid I've made an
awful mess of everything.

869
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:17,134
You mustn't blame yourself.

870
00:40:17,135 --> 00:40:19,309
Oh yes, I feel responsible
for Mrs. Sydney's death.

871
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,528
But it was an accident.

872
00:40:20,529 --> 00:40:23,313
If I had taken away the first day,
this never would have happened.

873
00:40:23,314 --> 00:40:25,359
Oh, they'd have had to wait for
the second trip just the same.

874
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,796
The only difference is it might
have happened three days ago.

875
00:40:27,797 --> 00:40:29,929
Oh, I wish I could forget it.

876
00:40:29,946 --> 00:40:33,236
I keep thinking of Mrs.
Sydney's son waiting for her.

877
00:40:33,237 --> 00:40:34,586
He won't be.

878
00:40:34,587 --> 00:40:36,283
He was killed a year ago, Anne.

879
00:40:36,284 --> 00:40:37,633
You really knew him?

880
00:40:37,634 --> 00:40:39,242
I thought you were just
trying to comfort her.

881
00:40:39,243 --> 00:40:40,765
He was mixed up in the most
vicious, depraved racket

882
00:40:40,766 --> 00:40:44,944
in the Orient, trying to cause an
innocent woman to commit suicide.

883
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:46,510
The woman's brother killed him.

884
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:49,819
Maybe it's just as well
Mrs. Sydney never got there.

885
00:40:49,862 --> 00:40:52,952
Well, how did you know?

886
00:40:52,996 --> 00:40:56,347
I was that woman's doctor.

887
00:40:56,391 --> 00:41:00,003
That couldn't have anything
to do with your being here?

888
00:41:00,046 --> 00:41:01,744
In a way it has.

889
00:41:01,745 --> 00:41:05,225
Do you really think we'll get
away from here in three months?

890
00:41:05,226 --> 00:41:07,357
As soon as Honeyman and Brand
reach the mainland they'll tell...

891
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:08,838
I don't think so.

892
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:11,056
You don't really think
they'd kill Ping, do you?

893
00:41:11,057 --> 00:41:12,667
If they have, they'll
never get to the mainland.

894
00:41:12,668 --> 00:41:15,284
If the they haven't,
Ping will never take them there,

895
00:41:15,285 --> 00:41:17,498
in which event they
probably will kill him.

896
00:41:17,499 --> 00:41:22,895
Well, the future doesn't
look very bright, does it?

897
00:41:30,338 --> 00:41:32,296
What's the rush?

898
00:41:32,297 --> 00:41:33,949
What's the rush?
Take it easy.

899
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,560
Take it easy.

900
00:41:35,561 --> 00:41:38,301
Now look, I don't like the
way you're washing those pots.

901
00:41:38,302 --> 00:41:40,738
The sweet potatoes we had today
tasted of yesterday's fish.

902
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:42,872
I haven't yet mastered the art.

903
00:41:42,873 --> 00:41:43,742
I'm sorry.

904
00:41:43,743 --> 00:41:44,699
There's no art to it.

905
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,874
It's just elbow grease.

906
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:47,441
If you weren't so lazy, you'd take

907
00:41:47,442 --> 00:41:49,181
those things down to the
beach and rub them with sand.

908
00:41:49,182 --> 00:41:53,056
That cleans them thoroughly
and I've told you that before.

909
00:42:03,702 --> 00:42:06,242
Hello there, Monica,
what's on the menu?

910
00:42:06,243 --> 00:42:07,591
Well, I'm inventing something.

911
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:09,376
It's a combination of
all kinds of things.

912
00:42:09,377 --> 00:42:10,899
You mean all kinds of fish.

913
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,249
Yeah.

914
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,989
What's he going to call it tonight?

915
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:14,947
Ask the chef.

916
00:42:14,948 --> 00:42:16,470
What do you call it again?

917
00:42:16,471 --> 00:42:17,950
It's bouillabaisse.

918
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,256
Oh yeah?

919
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,040
Fish chowder in Brooklyn.

920
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:22,519
Come on, let's get
the table set, honey.

921
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,480
I'll set the table
without the honey.

922
00:42:25,481 --> 00:42:26,436
How about a swim?

923
00:42:26,437 --> 00:42:27,220
I can't.

924
00:42:27,221 --> 00:42:28,220
I've got work to do.

925
00:42:28,221 --> 00:42:30,049
We're not all so lucky.

926
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:33,269
Well, well, who'd have thought three
months ago you would wind up here?

927
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:36,186
There you were, oh dear,
life is so difficult.

928
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:37,621
I don't know whether
to spend the summer

929
00:42:37,622 --> 00:42:41,409
in South Hampton or Bar Harbor,
and the servant problem, my dear.

930
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:43,720
And my stock and
bonds and factories.

931
00:42:43,721 --> 00:42:47,414
Say, I wonder how those poor
guys are getting along in your factory.

932
00:42:47,415 --> 00:42:49,546
You know, the ones that were striking
for shorter hours and better pay?

933
00:42:49,547 --> 00:42:50,809
I bet they miss you.

934
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:51,809
If you don't shut up...

935
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:52,680
What did I say?

936
00:42:52,681 --> 00:42:53,463
What did I do?

937
00:42:53,464 --> 00:42:54,508
You said too much.

938
00:42:54,509 --> 00:42:56,205
Isn't it bad enough around here?

939
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:58,729
Work, work, work from early
morning till late at night.

940
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:00,383
I can't even go for a swim.

941
00:43:00,384 --> 00:43:03,387
And look at you, supply
clerk and housekeeper.

942
00:43:03,388 --> 00:43:05,606
That's because I've had
experience as a stenographer.

943
00:43:05,607 --> 00:43:07,172
In what type of establishment?

944
00:43:07,173 --> 00:43:07,999
Never mind that.

945
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,870
I know my business.

946
00:43:08,871 --> 00:43:10,089
And how.

947
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,176
I'm a white collar worker.

948
00:43:11,177 --> 00:43:12,570
What can you do?

949
00:43:12,571 --> 00:43:14,571
There are plenty of
things I could do.

950
00:43:14,572 --> 00:43:17,400
It so happens that Mr. Taylor
and Mr. Malone won't give

951
00:43:17,401 --> 00:43:19,490
you a tumble and are you bored.

952
00:43:19,534 --> 00:43:21,231
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

953
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:24,059
Yeah, you're just sore because
you're left out in the cold,

954
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,060
not that you have to be.

955
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:27,106
There's always dear Jessup.

956
00:43:29,587 --> 00:43:32,547
See ya later, Polly.

957
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:33,983
Right back, toots.

958
00:43:38,553 --> 00:43:41,469
Bouillabaisse.

959
00:43:41,512 --> 00:43:44,036
We can call them in now.

960
00:43:51,479 --> 00:43:54,917
If I had Taylor here,
I'd, I'd show him...

961
00:43:55,918 --> 00:43:57,833
Hey, hm.

962
00:43:57,876 --> 00:44:00,313
Fish dinner.

963
00:44:16,242 --> 00:44:17,852
I think we've got enough.

964
00:44:17,853 --> 00:44:19,245
I don't think so.

965
00:44:19,246 --> 00:44:20,594
We still have two roofs
and the wall to finish.

966
00:44:20,595 --> 00:44:22,555
We need at least a hundred more.

967
00:44:23,467 --> 00:44:24,467
Dinner.

968
00:44:24,468 --> 00:44:27,819
I think we've got enough.

969
00:44:43,052 --> 00:44:44,052
Hello Thelma.

970
00:44:44,053 --> 00:44:45,009
Hello Donnie.

971
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:47,796
Hello Blubberpus.

972
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,537
Where is everybody?

973
00:44:49,538 --> 00:44:51,929
Swimming, enjoying themselves
as usual while we do the work.

974
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:53,496
Thelma, we're being exploited.

975
00:44:53,497 --> 00:44:54,977
Don't I know it.

976
00:44:54,978 --> 00:44:56,717
The nerve of them assigning
the menial work to us.

977
00:44:56,718 --> 00:44:59,800
Our services could be used to much
better advantage in many respects.

978
00:44:59,801 --> 00:45:01,983
Do you know that I offered to
write a history of our stay

979
00:45:01,984 --> 00:45:04,028
on this island and
what did Taylor say?

980
00:45:04,029 --> 00:45:05,508
All right, what did he say?

981
00:45:05,509 --> 00:45:07,119
Unproductive.

982
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,555
Well, there doesn't seem to
be much we can do about it.

983
00:45:08,556 --> 00:45:10,948
If there were something we could
do about it, would you be interested?

984
00:45:10,949 --> 00:45:11,906
You've been thinking again.

985
00:45:11,907 --> 00:45:12,907
Don't be silly.

986
00:45:12,908 --> 00:45:14,997
Don't be silly.

987
00:45:14,998 --> 00:45:16,867
Did it ever occur to
you that Taylor's reasons

988
00:45:16,868 --> 00:45:20,349
for hiding upon this island must
arise from some criminal past?

989
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:21,829
Are you just catching on?

990
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:23,744
That occurred to me five
minutes after we got here.

991
00:45:23,745 --> 00:45:26,529
All right, than if he's a criminal,
he's probably a liar as well.

992
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:27,530
So are most people.

993
00:45:27,531 --> 00:45:28,531
- What of it?
- What of it?

994
00:45:28,532 --> 00:45:29,576
What of it?

995
00:45:29,577 --> 00:45:30,881
That bird hears everything.

996
00:45:30,882 --> 00:45:34,059
Listen, he told us
that we were hundreds

997
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:37,061
of miles off any ship lane we,
like a pack of fools, believed him.

998
00:45:37,062 --> 00:45:37,845
How do we know?

999
00:45:37,846 --> 00:45:39,500
How do we know?

1000
00:45:39,501 --> 00:45:41,370
It's possible that every day,
just beyond that horizon,

1001
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:42,893
the ships are passing
back and forth.

1002
00:45:42,894 --> 00:45:45,069
And we, like a pack
of fools, sit here.

1003
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:46,244
What do you want to do?

1004
00:45:46,245 --> 00:45:47,594
Swim out there and thumb your way?

1005
00:45:47,595 --> 00:45:51,120
Oh no, but those
ships can be reached.

1006
00:45:51,163 --> 00:45:55,124
Has it occurred to you how I've
spent my time these evenings?

1007
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:57,082
Frankly, Senator, it hasn't.

1008
00:45:57,126 --> 00:46:03,088
Ah, well, the first few weeks were spent
purely in thought, general strategy.

1009
00:46:03,132 --> 00:46:05,613
And then I hit upon a tactic.

1010
00:46:05,656 --> 00:46:06,788
A tactic?

1011
00:46:06,831 --> 00:46:09,399
And I immediately set to work.

1012
00:46:09,442 --> 00:46:10,443
Here they come.

1013
00:46:10,487 --> 00:46:12,576
I'll tell you more after supper.

1014
00:46:12,577 --> 00:46:16,812
We'll be off this island in a week,
but remember there's...

1015
00:46:20,287 --> 00:46:23,107
I wonder what we're
going to have for dinner?

1016
00:46:23,108 --> 00:46:25,109
Well, it's nice to
wonder, isn't it?

1017
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:26,589
You don't suppose it
could be fish, do you?

1018
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:27,851
Let's get that food.

1019
00:46:27,852 --> 00:46:28,852
Come on, Thelma.

1020
00:46:28,853 --> 00:46:30,855
Get... the dinner.

1021
00:46:33,771 --> 00:46:34,990
You hungry?

1022
00:46:34,991 --> 00:46:36,338
Couldn't be hungrier,
I'll tell you.

1023
00:46:36,339 --> 00:46:37,731
You know, when I was
a boy in Chicago,

1024
00:46:37,732 --> 00:46:40,081
I worked in one of the
big packing firms there.

1025
00:46:40,082 --> 00:46:41,996
All I did all day long
was just smoke fish.

1026
00:46:41,997 --> 00:46:43,215
It got so...

1027
00:46:43,216 --> 00:46:44,433
You must have looked awfully sweet.

1028
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:45,911
I got so I thought I could never look

1029
00:46:45,912 --> 00:46:47,828
another fish in the eye,
but it gave me an idea.

1030
00:46:47,829 --> 00:46:49,656
Now, suppose that I
build a smoke oven.

1031
00:46:49,657 --> 00:46:53,138
Then when the stormy season comes along,
we have plenty of smoked fish.

1032
00:46:53,139 --> 00:46:56,184
Not a new idea at all, Mr.
Malone, I can assure you.

1033
00:46:56,185 --> 00:46:58,969
The government's been talking for
years about shortage and drought.

1034
00:46:58,970 --> 00:46:59,840
It's an old story.

1035
00:46:59,841 --> 00:47:01,190
Talking?

1036
00:47:01,191 --> 00:47:03,365
Than if we really do
it, it'll be quite new.

1037
00:47:03,366 --> 00:47:04,192
Hey, what's the idea?

1038
00:47:04,193 --> 00:47:05,411
Is that all I get?

1039
00:47:05,412 --> 00:47:07,108
I'm thinking about
your figure, dear.

1040
00:47:07,109 --> 00:47:09,590
You're getting awfully plump.

1041
00:47:09,762 --> 00:47:11,852
- Has everybody been served?
- Yes.

1042
00:47:11,853 --> 00:47:13,245
- Fine.
- Yes, indeed.

1043
00:47:13,246 --> 00:47:15,029
Well, maybe I can sit
down and have my dinner.

1044
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:16,248
Sure...

1045
00:47:16,249 --> 00:47:17,988
Have you young
ladies had a nice day?

1046
00:47:17,989 --> 00:47:19,861
A perfectly lovely day.

1047
00:47:19,904 --> 00:47:23,386
I paid a social call on Ms.
Thelma Chase of Long Island.

1048
00:47:23,429 --> 00:47:26,824
She gave me a delightful luncheon.

1049
00:47:26,868 --> 00:47:28,718
That was sweet of you, Thelma.

1050
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:31,654
I'm so happy to see you
girls getting on so well.

1051
00:47:31,655 --> 00:47:32,656
Sweet of me?

1052
00:47:32,657 --> 00:47:34,222
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

1053
00:47:34,223 --> 00:47:37,443
There's an unfair distribution
of work around here and I object.

1054
00:47:37,444 --> 00:47:39,314
Some people do practically
nothing and have all the fun.

1055
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:41,229
You're all taking advantage of me.

1056
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,187
Why can't I go swimming
when everyone else does

1057
00:47:43,188 --> 00:47:44,711
and take time off for fun and rest?

1058
00:47:44,712 --> 00:47:46,974
I'm entitled to a fair
share and all the comforts

1059
00:47:46,975 --> 00:47:51,153
and if I don't get it, I'll,
I'll, well, I'll just sit down.

1060
00:47:51,196 --> 00:47:53,155
Sit down.

1061
00:47:53,198 --> 00:47:56,462
Say, you know, If the
workers at the Chase company

1062
00:47:56,463 --> 00:47:58,159
had an eloquent leader
like you to speak for them,

1063
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,682
I'll bet you they
wouldn't have much trouble

1064
00:47:59,683 --> 00:48:01,075
getting what they're after.

1065
00:48:01,076 --> 00:48:02,990
Too bad you're not all
shareholders, isn't it?

1066
00:48:02,991 --> 00:48:05,480
I think Thelma's complaint is justified

1067
00:48:05,481 --> 00:48:08,735
and I nominate Johnny to do
the housework for awhile.

1068
00:48:08,736 --> 00:48:09,692
All in favor?

1069
00:48:09,693 --> 00:48:10,520
Aye.

1070
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:11,999
That's too preposterous.

1071
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,740
Sorry Johnny, but it seems
you're elected.

1072
00:48:13,741 --> 00:48:15,046
Elected.

1073
00:48:15,047 --> 00:48:16,830
You see, as you're
completely unequipped

1074
00:48:16,831 --> 00:48:19,659
for any productive work, you'll
have to remain unskilled labor.

1075
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,269
Join the Navy and learn a trade.

1076
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:22,420
But I, I cannot...

1077
00:48:24,055 --> 00:48:25,796
We'll see about this later.

1078
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,755
Just one big happy family.

1079
00:48:33,804 --> 00:48:35,284
Don't worry, Johnny.

1080
00:48:35,285 --> 00:48:37,328
There are only three meals a day.

1081
00:48:37,329 --> 00:48:38,766
How's he taking it?

1082
00:48:38,809 --> 00:48:39,941
Not very well.

1083
00:48:40,811 --> 00:48:42,073
I doubt it.

1084
00:48:42,074 --> 00:48:43,073
Well, keep him at
it, keep him at it.

1085
00:48:43,074 --> 00:48:44,728
Don't worry, I will.

1086
00:48:44,772 --> 00:48:46,251
Say, where's Iris?

1087
00:48:46,295 --> 00:48:48,253
Probably waiting on the corner.

1088
00:49:03,965 --> 00:49:04,965
Iris?

1089
00:49:09,274 --> 00:49:10,754
Well, what did I do?

1090
00:49:10,755 --> 00:49:12,233
That's just what I'm
going to find out.

1091
00:49:12,234 --> 00:49:14,888
Why don't you ask your questions
first and sock afterwards then?

1092
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:16,759
Because I like it this way better.

1093
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,456
Now come on, what's
going on between you two?

1094
00:49:18,457 --> 00:49:19,763
What two?

1095
00:49:19,764 --> 00:49:21,242
Are you going to pull
that baby face line?

1096
00:49:21,243 --> 00:49:22,503
You know who I mean.

1097
00:49:23,018 --> 00:49:24,288
Oh, you mean Thelma?

1098
00:49:24,289 --> 00:49:25,768
Oh, you know better than that.

1099
00:49:25,769 --> 00:49:27,727
I haven't given that
dame a tumble, honest.

1100
00:49:27,728 --> 00:49:29,206
What do you know about honest?

1101
00:49:29,207 --> 00:49:31,644
Didn't I see the way she's been
heaping your plate, feeding you up?

1102
00:49:31,645 --> 00:49:32,949
What about that undercover talk she

1103
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:34,734
was giving you just
now by the table?

1104
00:49:34,735 --> 00:49:36,518
Oh, you mean when she was kind
of whispering in my ear there?

1105
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:37,519
Yeah.

1106
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,174
Well, that was nothing.

1107
00:49:39,175 --> 00:49:42,480
It uh, seems that she's just
learned how to weave this grass

1108
00:49:42,481 --> 00:49:44,134
and uh, well, she said she thought

1109
00:49:44,135 --> 00:49:46,920
that I might like her to make me a
little window shade for my shack.

1110
00:49:46,921 --> 00:49:48,574
What for?

1111
00:49:48,575 --> 00:49:49,879
Well, she said she thought I
might like a little privacy.

1112
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,402
That's just what I thought.

1113
00:49:51,403 --> 00:49:55,799
If the time ever comes when you
need privacy, I'm making the curtains.

1114
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,191
All right, what
are you waiting for?

1115
00:49:57,192 --> 00:49:58,845
- Let's get started.
- Now, get this straight.

1116
00:49:58,846 --> 00:50:01,891
The next time I catch you fooling
around with that common kitchen help,

1117
00:50:01,892 --> 00:50:03,850
it will be curtains for you,
not the house.

1118
00:50:07,332 --> 00:50:10,248
Ms. Compton, I didn't know you cared.

1119
00:50:10,249 --> 00:50:13,990
You know, Anne, our little
community hasn't turned out so badly.

1120
00:50:13,991 --> 00:50:16,776
I hated the idea at first
but now everybody's changed.

1121
00:50:16,777 --> 00:50:17,777
It's not so bad.

1122
00:50:17,778 --> 00:50:18,778
Nobody's changed.

1123
00:50:18,779 --> 00:50:19,779
They haven't changed inside.

1124
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,215
Never satisfied, are you?

1125
00:50:21,216 --> 00:50:23,174
No, and I never will be here.

1126
00:50:23,218 --> 00:50:25,176
Never?

1127
00:50:25,177 --> 00:50:26,873
Don't you see I've got to get back?

1128
00:50:26,874 --> 00:50:27,699
Back to what?

1129
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:28,700
Civilization.

1130
00:50:28,701 --> 00:50:30,007
This isn't living.

1131
00:50:30,008 --> 00:50:31,486
Well, it all depends
on how you look at it.

1132
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:34,445
Your civilisation isn't
so civilized these days.

1133
00:50:34,446 --> 00:50:35,925
Well, you won't change
that by running away.

1134
00:50:35,926 --> 00:50:38,581
I suppose I did run
away from my chop.

1135
00:50:38,582 --> 00:50:40,277
I didn't think much
about it at the time,

1136
00:50:40,278 --> 00:50:43,151
didn't affect anybody except me.

1137
00:50:43,152 --> 00:50:44,716
But I'm not alone anymore.

1138
00:50:44,717 --> 00:50:47,284
Maybe the others haven't
changed, Anne, but I have.

1139
00:50:47,285 --> 00:50:50,244
I couldn't be content to
stay here again without you.

1140
00:50:50,245 --> 00:50:53,365
You could never be happy
living here, even with me.

1141
00:50:53,366 --> 00:50:54,901
Our lives are just beginning.

1142
00:50:54,902 --> 00:50:56,903
We've got to make
something of them.

1143
00:50:56,904 --> 00:50:57,904
Fire...

1144
00:50:57,905 --> 00:51:00,516
Hey Jim, the island's on fire.

1145
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:01,996
What?

1146
00:51:01,997 --> 00:51:03,344
Heaven forbid, the winds
are going to be terrible.

1147
00:51:03,345 --> 00:51:04,301
Everybody down at the beach.

1148
00:51:04,302 --> 00:51:05,302
Where are Thelma and John?

1149
00:51:05,303 --> 00:51:06,870
- Come on.
- Fire.

1150
00:51:14,791 --> 00:51:15,791
Where?

1151
00:51:15,792 --> 00:51:17,185
Right there, look.

1152
00:51:17,228 --> 00:51:18,708
The man, he's crazy.

1153
00:51:19,665 --> 00:51:21,275
What are you trying to do?

1154
00:51:21,276 --> 00:51:23,066
Set the whole island on fire?

1155
00:51:23,067 --> 00:51:25,627
If I'd known you were cold, Senator,
I'd have offered you a jacket.

1156
00:51:25,628 --> 00:51:26,933
It's time somebody did something.

1157
00:51:26,934 --> 00:51:28,935
You studiously avoiding
making any effort

1158
00:51:28,936 --> 00:51:30,675
to signal the passing ship
so I put it upon myself.

1159
00:51:30,676 --> 00:51:33,026
If you were so anxious to leave,
why didn't you come to me for advice?

1160
00:51:33,027 --> 00:51:34,549
We've had enough of your advice.

1161
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,290
Well, it's a pity but this
is all a wasted effort.

1162
00:51:36,291 --> 00:51:39,641
The ship lanes are miles away
and in the opposite direction.

1163
00:51:39,642 --> 00:51:41,512
They couldn't possibly have
seen your fire from here.

1164
00:51:41,513 --> 00:51:43,167
This is north, Johnny.

1165
00:51:43,168 --> 00:51:46,388
The nearest northern ship lane
from here is over a thousand miles.

1166
00:51:46,389 --> 00:51:47,736
Well, I think you'd better
pick up your pail and shovel

1167
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:49,067
and play nearer home.

1168
00:51:49,652 --> 00:51:51,610
I'll find a way yet.

1169
00:51:51,611 --> 00:51:54,531
Well, I hope it's at
least as good as this one.

1170
00:51:55,614 --> 00:51:57,051
Oh.

1171
00:52:03,962 --> 00:52:06,842
I tell ya, that Chinaman's
pulling a fast one.

1172
00:52:06,843 --> 00:52:08,539
We should have hit China by now.

1173
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:11,717
Not a lot we're trying to do
about it since we ran out of gas.

1174
00:52:11,718 --> 00:52:13,022
Well, we should have been in
China before we ran out of gas.

1175
00:52:13,023 --> 00:52:13,993
Oh, we're not.

1176
00:52:13,994 --> 00:52:14,981
I'll tell you what I'll do.

1177
00:52:14,982 --> 00:52:16,460
I'll say this boat myself.

1178
00:52:16,461 --> 00:52:18,072
Oh no, you won't.

1179
00:52:18,073 --> 00:52:19,463
I'll take the Chinaman.

1180
00:52:19,464 --> 00:52:21,945
Come on, I'll see you with him.

1181
00:52:26,428 --> 00:52:27,908
Nice breeze.

1182
00:52:27,951 --> 00:52:29,213
Yes, very nice.

1183
00:52:29,214 --> 00:52:31,388
And we ought to be parallel to...

1184
00:52:31,389 --> 00:52:32,782
Oh yes.

1185
00:52:32,783 --> 00:52:34,391
What are we seeing right
at the Sermon Islands?

1186
00:52:34,392 --> 00:52:35,828
Oh, someday maybe.

1187
00:52:35,872 --> 00:52:36,872
We pass.

1188
00:52:36,873 --> 00:52:38,092
We pass.

1189
00:52:38,093 --> 00:52:39,092
You've been saying
that for two weeks.

1190
00:52:39,093 --> 00:52:40,823
When do we hit the mainland?

1191
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:43,793
Maybe in two days,
maybe three, maybe never.

1192
00:52:43,794 --> 00:52:44,836
Pretty quick now.

1193
00:52:44,837 --> 00:52:46,055
You're lying to me.

1194
00:52:46,056 --> 00:52:47,796
You've been going
around in circles.

1195
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:50,277
I'll give you three days
to show me some land.

1196
00:52:50,278 --> 00:52:52,757
And if you don't, you'll never
put your hands in a room again.

1197
00:52:52,758 --> 00:52:53,758
All right.

1198
00:52:53,759 --> 00:52:56,545
You sail the boat.

1199
00:52:56,588 --> 00:53:00,505
You know we don't know
how to sail a boat.

1200
00:53:00,549 --> 00:53:01,985
Oh, fairly easy.

1201
00:53:02,029 --> 00:53:03,552
Just turn wheel.

1202
00:53:03,595 --> 00:53:06,990
Now wait a minute, maybe
we've been too good to you.

1203
00:53:08,442 --> 00:53:09,992
You've got to do better.

1204
00:53:09,993 --> 00:53:11,429
I do better,

1205
00:53:12,954 --> 00:53:15,084
You've got to do better than that.

1206
00:53:57,047 --> 00:53:59,607
Tell me something,
darling, but honestly.

1207
00:53:59,608 --> 00:54:00,913
All right.

1208
00:54:00,914 --> 00:54:03,089
Have you been happy
these last few days?

1209
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:05,560
Happier than I've
been for a long time.

1210
00:54:05,561 --> 00:54:07,528
Let's forget everything that
ever happened in the past.

1211
00:54:07,529 --> 00:54:09,039
I've already forgotten.

1212
00:54:09,052 --> 00:54:11,576
We need never think about it again.

1213
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:13,926
From now on, we
live in the present.

1214
00:54:13,927 --> 00:54:15,101
And think of the future.

1215
00:54:15,102 --> 00:54:16,972
Ah, that's just what we won't do.

1216
00:54:16,973 --> 00:54:18,105
Why not?

1217
00:54:18,106 --> 00:54:19,496
The future has everything to offer.

1218
00:54:19,497 --> 00:54:21,064
Of course it has.

1219
00:54:21,065 --> 00:54:22,891
Our little community is
getting along very well and...

1220
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:24,459
No, Jim.

1221
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:26,895
It's not our future on this
island I'm thinking about.

1222
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:27,896
This is only half living.

1223
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:29,290
It's the nicest half.

1224
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:31,292
You know that isn't true.

1225
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:34,298
Unless we face our responsibilities,

1226
00:54:34,299 --> 00:54:38,168
we can't respect ourselves,
much less each other.

1227
00:54:38,169 --> 00:54:41,650
This may sound like an empty promise,
Anne, there doesn't seem to be

1228
00:54:41,651 --> 00:54:45,131
any way to fulfill it, but you mean
more to me than anything else.

1229
00:54:45,132 --> 00:54:48,396
If we ever can get
away, we'll go together.

1230
00:54:56,404 --> 00:54:57,404
Iris?

1231
00:54:59,885 --> 00:55:01,322
Oh, it's you.

1232
00:55:01,365 --> 00:55:02,455
What do you want?

1233
00:55:02,497 --> 00:55:04,107
I, are you alone?

1234
00:55:04,108 --> 00:55:05,778
Yes, but I'm not lonesome.

1235
00:55:06,645 --> 00:55:07,805
Are you available?

1236
00:55:07,806 --> 00:55:09,198
I, I, I want to talk to you.

1237
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:10,287
What about?

1238
00:55:10,331 --> 00:55:12,289
Well, uh, about yourself.

1239
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:13,333
All right.

1240
00:55:13,334 --> 00:55:14,334
Come on in.

1241
00:55:19,166 --> 00:55:21,168
Ah, what a cozy little place.

1242
00:55:21,169 --> 00:55:22,690
You're really very clever, Iris.

1243
00:55:22,691 --> 00:55:23,647
Excellent handicraft.

1244
00:55:23,648 --> 00:55:24,885
Did Thelma make this?

1245
00:55:24,886 --> 00:55:27,173
So far Thelma didn't make anything,
and if she knows what good for her...

1246
00:55:27,174 --> 00:55:28,744
Ah, fighting with Thelma?

1247
00:55:28,745 --> 00:55:32,178
Allowing selfish motives to interfere
with the welfare of the community?

1248
00:55:32,179 --> 00:55:33,319
What's it to you?

1249
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,789
I want to put you in my book.

1250
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:37,618
I'd hope that you might furnish
me with its most interesting material.

1251
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:39,315
Well, I'll do anything I can.

1252
00:55:39,316 --> 00:55:40,186
Fine.

1253
00:55:40,187 --> 00:55:41,840
That the proper spirit.

1254
00:55:41,841 --> 00:55:44,860
You know, in a community such as ours,
it's one for all, all for one,

1255
00:55:44,861 --> 00:55:48,368
what's mine is yours, and it necessarily
follows that, that what's yours is...

1256
00:55:48,369 --> 00:55:49,238
Mine.

1257
00:55:49,239 --> 00:55:50,632
Ah, yes.

1258
00:55:50,633 --> 00:55:52,372
Um, I want to record for
posterity the reactions

1259
00:55:52,373 --> 00:55:54,374
of a person such as yourself to uh,

1260
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:56,071
shall we say, uh,
nature in the raw.

1261
00:55:56,072 --> 00:55:57,464
Well, if we're going to personal...

1262
00:55:57,465 --> 00:55:59,118
Ah, no, no, no. Don't,
don't misunderstand me.

1263
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:00,641
I'm only trying to help.

1264
00:56:00,642 --> 00:56:02,686
You must live so that no
fault can be found with you.

1265
00:56:02,687 --> 00:56:05,211
Last night I happened to see,
not that I wanted to, Malone.

1266
00:56:05,212 --> 00:56:08,171
Malone put his arm
around you like this.

1267
00:56:08,215 --> 00:56:10,391
Now, don't try to deny it.

1268
00:56:10,392 --> 00:56:11,391
I saw you.

1269
00:56:11,392 --> 00:56:14,656
It was just like this.

1270
00:56:14,699 --> 00:56:16,310
Iris, it was a disgrace.

1271
00:56:16,311 --> 00:56:17,701
What was the disgrace about it?

1272
00:56:17,702 --> 00:56:19,660
Why, the very manner in which he...

1273
00:56:19,661 --> 00:56:23,578
Now wait a minute, Senator,
what possible harm can there be to it?

1274
00:56:23,579 --> 00:56:25,492
Why, all he did was put his
arms around me like this

1275
00:56:25,493 --> 00:56:28,364
and said... well, it's none of
your business what he said.

1276
00:56:28,365 --> 00:56:30,105
Why, you act as if it was a crime.

1277
00:56:30,106 --> 00:56:32,499
Well, uh, maybe I've
been a little too hasty.

1278
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,197
Perhaps I misjudged.

1279
00:56:34,198 --> 00:56:35,893
I'm really beginning to feel as
though you're perfectly right.

1280
00:56:35,894 --> 00:56:37,286
I knew you'd see
it my way, Senator.

1281
00:56:37,287 --> 00:56:40,638
Yes, uh, well, the uh,
little talk didn't hurt.

1282
00:56:40,682 --> 00:56:44,251
In fact I honestly think that uh,

1283
00:56:44,294 --> 00:56:50,213
the little understanding talk
should uh, come more often.

1284
00:56:50,257 --> 00:56:54,304
Oh Senator, what was it
you came to see me about?

1285
00:57:03,542 --> 00:57:04,922
How am I doing, Polly.

1286
00:57:07,318 --> 00:57:08,538
Pretty good, toots.

1287
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:17,065
Will you please shut up?

1288
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:21,026
Now look, Thelma, I can't whistle
at night because you want to sleep.

1289
00:57:21,027 --> 00:57:23,376
I can't whistle in the day time
because it bothers your nerves.

1290
00:57:23,377 --> 00:57:24,551
When can a man whistle?

1291
00:57:24,552 --> 00:57:26,292
Oh, you're tough to get along with.

1292
00:57:26,293 --> 00:57:28,119
I'm very easy to get along with.

1293
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:28,990
Just tell me how.

1294
00:57:28,991 --> 00:57:31,254
I've told you, shut up.

1295
00:57:31,298 --> 00:57:32,560
Now look, Thelma.

1296
00:57:32,561 --> 00:57:34,125
You've got to get over the jitters.

1297
00:57:34,126 --> 00:57:36,650
Why don't you settle
down and calm yourself?

1298
00:57:36,651 --> 00:57:39,696
Everybody else around here's
trying to make the best of everything.

1299
00:57:39,697 --> 00:57:41,698
You could be pretty happy
if you wanted to be.

1300
00:57:41,699 --> 00:57:43,223
Thanks for the advice.

1301
00:57:43,224 --> 00:57:45,093
Well, that's more than advice.

1302
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:46,356
Really?

1303
00:57:46,357 --> 00:57:50,882
Gee, Thelma, don't you think
you could learn to care just a little?

1304
00:57:50,883 --> 00:57:52,666
We're going to be here
a long time, you know?

1305
00:57:52,667 --> 00:57:55,670
Is this your way of uh, proposing?

1306
00:57:55,713 --> 00:57:56,845
Yeah.

1307
00:57:56,888 --> 00:58:00,240
Well, this is my way of accepting.

1308
00:58:00,283 --> 00:58:01,893
She loves me.

1309
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:05,854
101, 102, 103.

1310
00:58:05,855 --> 00:58:07,507
Can't you put that stuff down?

1311
00:58:07,508 --> 00:58:09,291
We finally got to the
one place in the world

1312
00:58:09,292 --> 00:58:12,076
where you don't need money and
you can't even forget it here.

1313
00:58:12,077 --> 00:58:14,514
Oh, I'm just counting
to pass the time away.

1314
00:58:14,515 --> 00:58:16,080
If that's the best way
you can pass the time,

1315
00:58:16,081 --> 00:58:18,257
you're going to be a
great disappointment.

1316
00:58:18,258 --> 00:58:19,214
What do you want it for?

1317
00:58:19,215 --> 00:58:20,824
What good is it doing you?

1318
00:58:20,825 --> 00:58:23,305
If you must count something,
well, wait until tonight.

1319
00:58:23,306 --> 00:58:24,567
We'll count the stars.

1320
00:58:24,568 --> 00:58:25,786
Do you want to have some fun?

1321
00:58:25,787 --> 00:58:26,527
Sure.

1322
00:58:26,528 --> 00:58:27,527
OK, let's burn it.

1323
00:58:27,528 --> 00:58:28,529
Are you crazy?

1324
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:30,312
Yeah, but not about the money.

1325
00:58:30,313 --> 00:58:31,095
OK, kid.

1326
00:58:31,096 --> 00:58:32,446
Let's both go crazy.

1327
00:58:32,447 --> 00:58:34,447
As long as we're going to wipe
out the past, let's complete the job.

1328
00:58:34,448 --> 00:58:35,971
Yahoo.

1329
00:58:35,972 --> 00:58:37,624
Money, some guys burn
because they love this stuff

1330
00:58:37,625 --> 00:58:40,410
and here we are burning it
because we love each other.

1331
00:58:40,411 --> 00:58:42,019
Yeah, a thousand dollar bill.

1332
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,934
Funny how geography changes
the value of this stuff.

1333
00:58:43,935 --> 00:58:45,501
You know, we made
a great discovery.

1334
00:58:45,502 --> 00:58:47,983
Money's no good at all.

1335
00:58:48,026 --> 00:58:51,421
Anne, Anne.

1336
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:53,640
Have you seen it?
Have you seen it?

1337
00:58:53,641 --> 00:58:54,859
Seen what?

1338
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:55,729
It's marvelous,
marvelous, marvelous.

1339
00:58:55,730 --> 00:58:57,122
I can't believe it.

1340
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:58,376
What's the matter?

1341
00:58:58,377 --> 00:58:59,210
Did you see a ghost or something?

1342
00:58:59,211 --> 00:59:00,386
A ghost?

1343
00:59:00,387 --> 00:59:01,649
What is it?

1344
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:02,866
It's not a ghost.
It's the real thing.

1345
00:59:02,867 --> 00:59:04,303
A boat, a big, beautiful boat.

1346
00:59:04,304 --> 00:59:06,261
A magnificent monarch of
the sea coming this way.

1347
00:59:06,262 --> 00:59:07,393
Come, let me show you.

1348
00:59:07,394 --> 00:59:08,394
Oh.

1349
00:59:08,395 --> 00:59:10,353
Oh, Johnny, he's fainted.

1350
00:59:10,354 --> 00:59:11,179
A boat.

1351
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,136
A boat?

1352
00:59:12,137 --> 00:59:14,531
Let's leave that dough.

1353
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:21,582
What's happened?

1354
00:59:21,583 --> 00:59:23,452
It's Johnny, he's gone crazy
and I always knew he would

1355
00:59:23,453 --> 00:59:24,932
Taylor, Taylor, come here.

1356
00:59:24,933 --> 00:59:25,933
A boat is coming.

1357
00:59:25,934 --> 00:59:27,239
What?

1358
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,502
The Navy, the Navy
has come to rescue us.

1359
00:59:29,503 --> 00:59:31,025
I'm positive it's the Navy.

1360
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:32,418
Of course they'd never
give up the search for us.

1361
00:59:32,419 --> 00:59:34,333
Those greyhounds of
the sea are everywhere.

1362
00:59:34,334 --> 00:59:36,205
Uh oh, here come the marines.

1363
00:59:36,206 --> 00:59:38,815
I want to get some decent
clothes again and a manicure.

1364
00:59:38,816 --> 00:59:41,796
Gee, I don't feel like
I thought I would at all.

1365
00:59:42,791 --> 00:59:45,431
Come on, let's see
what this is all about.

1366
00:59:45,432 --> 00:59:46,824
Come on, everybody.

1367
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:59,576
Nice work, Ping.

1368
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:03,058
Hello Ping.

1369
01:00:03,101 --> 01:00:05,016
I come back, Mr. Taylor.

1370
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,757
I knew you would, Ping.

1371
01:00:10,848 --> 01:00:12,328
What happened, Ping?

1372
01:00:12,329 --> 01:00:13,502
Where are Honeyman and Brand?

1373
01:00:13,503 --> 01:00:18,290
Them fall overboard,
Mr. Taylor.

1374
01:00:18,334 --> 01:00:24,732
I think I done for, Mr. Taylor.

1375
01:00:32,647 --> 01:00:34,567
Where is everybody?

1376
01:00:34,568 --> 01:00:36,220
It hasn't been so quiet
here in a long time.

1377
01:00:36,221 --> 01:00:39,267
They're down at the beach
trying to hold the senator back.

1378
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:40,442
Don't tell me he's going
to swim out to the boat.

1379
01:00:40,443 --> 01:00:41,661
That's what's they're afraid of.

1380
01:00:41,662 --> 01:00:43,184
He wants to get the best bunk.

1381
01:00:43,185 --> 01:00:45,142
Yeah, well, he'll sleep
on deck and like it.

1382
01:00:45,143 --> 01:00:46,622
Oh, don't worry about the senator.

1383
01:00:46,623 --> 01:00:50,793
He'll find something in the
Constitution to provide him with a bunk.

1384
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:56,110
Now I'll have to start worrying
about a job all over again.

1385
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:58,547
Don't worry, I'll
help you find a job.

1386
01:00:58,548 --> 01:01:00,549
As a strike breaker in
one of your factories?

1387
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:03,031
No, I learned something
on that island.

1388
01:01:03,032 --> 01:01:04,901
There are going to
be a lot of changes.

1389
01:01:04,902 --> 01:01:07,513
I'm writing a history of
our stay on this island.

1390
01:01:07,514 --> 01:01:08,689
Now, let's see.

1391
01:01:08,732 --> 01:01:10,952
After I saved those who survived,

1392
01:01:10,995 --> 01:01:14,477
I took on the responsibility
of leadership and set

1393
01:01:14,478 --> 01:01:16,957
about establishing a
democratic community.

1394
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:18,480
I was given the title of...

1395
01:01:18,481 --> 01:01:19,830
Blubberpus.

1396
01:01:19,831 --> 01:01:21,440
You know, honey, I've
got a pretty good idea.

1397
01:01:21,441 --> 01:01:23,486
It better be a new one.

1398
01:01:23,487 --> 01:01:26,357
What do you say when we get
to Hong Kong we tie the knot?

1399
01:01:26,358 --> 01:01:28,185
Then we can buy ourselves
a little boat like this

1400
01:01:28,186 --> 01:01:30,144
and head back to the island
and spend our honeymoon.

1401
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:31,798
I'll go for the first part of it

1402
01:01:31,799 --> 01:01:35,269
but we'll spend the honeymoon
and the money in Shanghai.

1403
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:36,324
Looks like I'm the boss all right.

1404
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:37,544
Yes you are.

1405
01:01:41,038 --> 01:01:44,158
Well, things aren't quite
the way you figured them

1406
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:45,551
out for yourself, are they pal?

1407
01:01:45,552 --> 01:01:47,379
Not quite.

1408
01:01:47,423 --> 01:01:49,153
You gotta big stretch to do?

1409
01:01:49,154 --> 01:01:51,905
I had a hunch you were on
the lam from the beginning.

1410
01:01:51,906 --> 01:01:54,864
After all, if I didn't
know the sign, s who would?

1411
01:01:54,865 --> 01:01:59,087
Look Jim, if this dough is of
any use to you, just say the word.

1412
01:01:59,088 --> 01:02:00,522
I'm afraid I can't
use it where I'm going.

1413
01:02:00,523 --> 01:02:02,394
A tough a rap as that, eh?

1414
01:02:02,395 --> 01:02:04,961
Well, 150 grand is a lot of
dough in any man's country.

1415
01:02:04,962 --> 01:02:06,310
Don't forget you can count on me.

1416
01:02:06,311 --> 01:02:08,009
Thanks.

1417
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:09,357
Here, take this wheel and keep
the compass right where it is.

1418
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:10,358
OK.

1419
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,236
You made up your mind?

1420
01:02:18,237 --> 01:02:19,193
You still want to go back?

1421
01:02:19,194 --> 01:02:20,543
I thought we all had.

1422
01:02:20,544 --> 01:02:22,109
Taylor's only going
back on account of you.

1423
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:24,241
The rest of us are
riding on velvet.

1424
01:02:24,242 --> 01:02:26,722
Haven't you any idea why
he didn't want to go back?

1425
01:02:26,723 --> 01:02:28,245
Because the minute
this boat hits port,

1426
01:02:28,246 --> 01:02:29,725
there's going to be
somebody there to grab him.

1427
01:02:29,726 --> 01:02:34,164
So it looks to me like you better
make plans for your future alone.

1428
01:02:34,165 --> 01:02:35,819
I don't think so.

1429
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:37,385
Kept her right on the line, Cap.

1430
01:02:37,386 --> 01:02:39,606
OK, thank you.

1431
01:02:39,649 --> 01:02:41,651
What's the matter.

1432
01:02:41,695 --> 01:02:44,306
I was talking to Malone.

1433
01:02:44,349 --> 01:02:47,265
Jim, is it too late for
me to change my mind?

1434
01:02:47,266 --> 01:02:49,615
Couldn't we go back to
the island or anywhere?

1435
01:02:49,616 --> 01:02:52,008
No, you made me see
everything very clearly.

1436
01:02:52,009 --> 01:02:54,229
We must face life, not run away.

1437
01:02:54,272 --> 01:02:59,364
