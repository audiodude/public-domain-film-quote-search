Hey General, want a ride?

10
00:01:23,295 --> 00:01:25,558
Suck jerk naïve!

11
00:01:25,862 --> 00:01:27,834
That's a breach of contract,

12
00:01:27,934 --> 00:01:30,716
A breach of visual contract, moron!

13
00:01:32,603 --> 00:01:35,036
They've no respect
for their Country or their flag,

or medals or anybody!

I'm gonna put you on report,
that's what I'm gonna do.

16
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,635
I'm gonna put you on report
with the Department of Transportation.

17
00:01:44,324 --> 00:01:46,193
Hello! Hello!

18
00:01:46,517 --> 00:01:49,136
Department of Transportation? Hello!

19
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,224
Sunspots!

20
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:54,963
Is there anything more beautiful?

21
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:58,609
I'm sitting next to her.

22
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,531
I love you.

23
00:02:03,918 --> 00:02:05,823
- A little music?
- Fine.

24
00:02:05,862 --> 00:02:08,216
- That's terrible.
- You've no taste.

25
00:02:13,053 --> 00:02:15,260
This wing... I'll look like a mess.

26
00:02:15,284 --> 00:02:17,245
- You look fine.
- No!

27
00:02:17,355 --> 00:02:19,346
- Will you leave that alone?
- No, leave it!

28
00:02:19,365 --> 00:02:21,169
- Oh, come on.
- Ah!

29
00:02:23,972 --> 00:02:25,420
Wow.

30
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,913
It's nice to be in the Country.

31
00:02:33,505 --> 00:02:37,454
City streets got bums on every corner,
pushin', shovin', hustlin'...

32
00:02:40,545 --> 00:02:42,786
There's no competition out there.

33
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,977
We should do this more often.

34
00:03:33,861 --> 00:03:36,349
- Get lost?
- We're not lost.

35
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:40,596
Why is it a man
will never admit he's lost?

36
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,221
We passed half a dozen stations and you
wouldn't pull to one of them for directions.

37
00:03:45,464 --> 00:03:47,290
But what does the map say?

38
00:03:47,735 --> 00:03:49,969
The map isn't saying anything.

39
00:03:51,003 --> 00:03:52,643
Wait a minute.

40
00:03:53,143 --> 00:03:55,595
The cabin's a mile south
of Steepston?

41
00:03:55,606 --> 00:03:57,712
Yeah, that's what Lucas said.

42
00:03:58,143 --> 00:04:01,232
You won't believe this.
We're almost there!

43
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:05,387
- The cabin should be over...
- Just around the corner, yeah, I know.

44
00:04:06,026 --> 00:04:08,958
Go on.
Let's walk.

45
00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:14,998
It's beautiful.

46
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:18,529
How long has your friend lived here?

47
00:04:18,864 --> 00:04:20,949
Lucas? About... no long.

48
00:04:21,287 --> 00:04:24,168
Well, which for you
could mean half a century.

49
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:26,378
It’s more like 12 years.

50
00:04:29,197 --> 00:04:32,538
After all that time, why does he
suddenly want to see you?

51
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:35,494
I don't know... he...

52
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,243
He said something was worrying him.

53
00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:23,153
Mac!

54
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,289
Mac!

55
00:05:34,372 --> 00:05:36,104
He's dead.

56
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,649
Your friend?

57
00:05:38,348 --> 00:05:40,197
How can you be so sure?

58
00:05:41,754 --> 00:05:43,378
I just know.

59
00:06:39,368 --> 00:06:41,437
What would we have here?

60
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,951
What you do, boy?

61
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:48,465
Oh no...

62
00:06:48,855 --> 00:06:51,371
I didn't have nothing to do with this.

63
00:06:51,722 --> 00:06:53,891
Body on floor...

64
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:57,444
You standing over him
with a sword in hand...

65
00:06:58,993 --> 00:07:01,917
Looks like your guilty
as hell to me, boy.

66
00:07:08,158 --> 00:07:10,341
You all right, son?

67
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,073
- What's your name?
- Leo.

68
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:16,728
Leo Atkins.

69
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:20,366
I have never seen you before.
You from around here?

70
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:22,480
No. I'm from...

71
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:27,590
I'm from nowhere in particular.

72
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,716
I'm real pleased to meet you, Leo.

73
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:33,338
Let me tell you
where you're going.

74
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,195
You're gonna ride the lightning.

75
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:43,668
You killed a man.
And you're gonna fry.

76
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:55,197
- Sorry Mac.
- Are we bored?

77
00:07:55,232 --> 00:07:56,920
No, we're not bored.

78
00:07:57,021 --> 00:07:59,856
Actually, I was looking at
this book of drawings, Da Vinci.

79
00:08:00,109 --> 00:08:03,072
This dude was making flying machines
when you were in diapers.

80
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,615
The thing is, if he can
design gliders and stuff,

81
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:08,918
why didn't he get our butts
airborne back then?

82
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,718
'Cause he was hired
to make gunpowder, instead.

83
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:13,475
- You finished those invoices yet?
- Ah... no.

84
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:14,927
No? Why not?

85
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:17,236
- I've been busy.
- Yeah, you being busy?

86
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:19,019
Yeah! I've been busy!

87
00:08:19,022 --> 00:08:21,176
You know, I thing you got
a little bit too much time on your hands.

88
00:08:21,211 --> 00:08:23,833
- You need to spend a little time in jail.
- Jail! Why? For...

89
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:26,946
assault with a paper airplane?
For littering your office? What!

90
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,756
- I'll tell you on the way to Steepston.
- Steepston?

91
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:30,154
That's a place that doesn't
even have crosswalks.

92
00:08:30,255 --> 00:08:33,074
- Why would we want to go to Steepston?
- What's this about Steepston?

93
00:08:33,088 --> 00:08:35,941
- Because you're driving.
- The T-Bird?

94
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:39,010
- Bring it around the front, would you?
- Good, I'll get my jacket.

95
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:43,176
I need to talk to the guy
they're holding for murdering Lucas.

96
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,123
Ok, I'll close up the shop
and I'll come with you.

97
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,153
No, I need to do this on my own.

98
00:08:48,622 --> 00:08:50,431
But you are taking Richie...

99
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,930
Well, I need him for something.

100
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:57,102
I know why
you don't want me there.

101
00:08:57,292 --> 00:08:59,828
You're afraid that what happened
to Lucas could happen to you.

102
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:01,712
That never crossed my mind.

103
00:09:01,747 --> 00:09:03,823
- Then, stay here!
- Tessa...

104
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:05,888
they may have the wrong man.

105
00:09:05,923 --> 00:09:09,000
I can't let him just...
stew in jail.

106
00:09:09,057 --> 00:09:10,487
I'll be back.

107
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,616
Smile!

108
00:09:13,926 --> 00:09:17,313
- Promise?
- Scout's honor. Here.

109
00:09:32,373 --> 00:09:35,318
The police blotter mentioned
a report of a...

110
00:09:35,846 --> 00:09:37,903
just tell me
if I got this all wrong...

111
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:39,885
a sword fight
on these premises?

112
00:09:39,896 --> 00:09:41,412
This is Chinese.

113
00:09:41,888 --> 00:09:43,463
You got it wrong.

114
00:09:44,197 --> 00:09:46,293
So, what did happen?

115
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:51,156
We caught a young burglar.

116
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,981
The boy, who has
a vivid imagination...

117
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,136
was trying to steal a sword.

118
00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:58,021
- No sword fight.
- No.

119
00:09:58,805 --> 00:10:02,648
You've heard about
the headless body they found up North?

120
00:10:02,683 --> 00:10:03,949
Of course, who hasn't?

121
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:06,020
I just thought there might be a connection.

122
00:10:06,328 --> 00:10:07,210
Why?

123
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:10,662
Because the victim had a big sword
next to his body when they found him.

124
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,010
Sounds like a great story.

125
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:15,436
Good luck with it.

126
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,004
Yeah, well, thanks.

127
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,763
I guess you know
a lot about swords.

128
00:10:24,928 --> 00:10:26,801
You're so good at fencing.

129
00:10:26,936 --> 00:10:29,763
I might have to come back
for your expert opinion.

130
00:10:30,862 --> 00:10:34,165
My expert's opinion
is that you're wasting your time.

131
00:10:34,729 --> 00:10:37,310
Yeah? Well, thanks.

132
00:10:37,775 --> 00:10:40,498
I'm sure with your help,
this will be a dynamite story.

133
00:11:03,976 --> 00:11:05,991
I'm Sergeant Powell.
I talked to you this morning.

134
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,609
Sergeant Powell,
I'm Howard Crowley.

135
00:11:09,117 --> 00:11:10,486
Come on in.

136
00:11:11,051 --> 00:11:14,277
So, our little horror story
brought you here.

137
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:15,274
Coffee?

138
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,983
Yeah, we got one of those ourselves:

139
00:11:17,193 --> 00:11:20,628
We got a headless body
on a city bridge a while back.

140
00:11:25,337 --> 00:11:27,078
I know that, Sergeant.

141
00:11:27,105 --> 00:11:29,142
We do get TV reception,

142
00:11:29,202 --> 00:11:31,473
even way up here.

143
00:11:31,488 --> 00:11:32,914
Sorry.

144
00:11:34,247 --> 00:11:37,144
I was going to call you anyway
to compare notes.

145
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,901
We got no suspects, no witnesses.

146
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,524
Ours was done with a
very sharp instrument.

147
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:44,920
So it probably wasn't an ax,
or a chainsaw or...

148
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,502
What it was, probably,
was a sword, right?

149
00:11:48,697 --> 00:11:50,490
You're guessing or you've got something?

150
00:11:50,518 --> 00:11:52,355
We've got a sword.

151
00:11:52,457 --> 00:11:54,856
I'd run it into our lab
to check the theory...

152
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:56,783
if we had a lab.

153
00:11:56,813 --> 00:11:58,861
Planned to send it
to the county seat this afternoon.

154
00:11:58,872 --> 00:12:02,452
I'd be happy to help with
the interrogation if you're interested.

155
00:12:02,462 --> 00:12:04,298
I think that can be arranged.

156
00:12:04,743 --> 00:12:07,066
I suppose you like to see
the crime scene first.

157
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:09,957
If I could.
Who was the victim?

158
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,189
A man named Desiree,

159
00:12:13,224 --> 00:12:14,983
Lucas Desiree.

160
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:17,885
- He kept pretty much to himself.
- French?

161
00:12:18,248 --> 00:12:20,307
Old southern stock.

162
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,461
Funny, him coming all
the way up here to live.

163
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:27,199
His kinfolk probably owned
a lot of your kinfolk...

164
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,075
once upon a time.

165
00:12:34,718 --> 00:12:38,978
So we like go to cabin sift through
the place for clues the police missed?

166
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:41,054
No, they probably didn't miss anything.

167
00:12:41,513 --> 00:12:44,855
I still don't get what would posses Lucas
to move out in the middle of nowhere.

168
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,219
He just wanted get away,
be on his own.

169
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,548
Like you did?

170
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,535
Out in the country, you can't take
your mistress into the woods...

171
00:12:53,536 --> 00:12:56,299
for a quickie without
twenty people knowing about it.

172
00:12:56,626 --> 00:12:58,473
Lucas was very careful.

173
00:12:58,508 --> 00:13:00,310
He didn't advertise
his whereabouts.

174
00:13:00,403 --> 00:13:04,157
And you don't think it's this bum that
the papers are talking about, who did it?

175
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,810
Maybe. Maybe not.

176
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,404
I need to get close enough
to be sure.

177
00:13:09,407 --> 00:13:10,825
Wait a minute, Sherlock...

178
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:14,283
are you trying to tell me there is
a loose Immortal cruising around here...

179
00:13:14,284 --> 00:13:15,999
chopping off people's heads...

180
00:13:16,021 --> 00:13:18,507
in this vicinity, where
you and I are going?

181
00:13:18,571 --> 00:13:20,971
Possibly. We'll find out.

182
00:13:21,027 --> 00:13:23,002
Oh, man!

183
00:13:37,225 --> 00:13:39,616
You're trying my patience, Leo.

184
00:13:39,638 --> 00:13:41,698
You talk but you don't say anything.

185
00:13:41,723 --> 00:13:44,500
- I'm trying.
- Tell me again.

186
00:13:44,563 --> 00:13:47,718
I don't know nothing I didn't
know five minutes ago.

187
00:13:47,747 --> 00:13:49,671
You do that pretty well, Leo.

188
00:13:49,678 --> 00:13:53,048
"Crazy old Leo, wouldn't harm a flea"
That's what that man in the cabin thought.

189
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,275
Then you took off his head!

190
00:13:54,276 --> 00:13:56,371
I never took no heads!

191
00:13:56,648 --> 00:13:59,372
Oh, I knew a guy who took heads.

192
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,191
He put it on the end of his bayonet.

193
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,945
Yeah, you knew our guy.
And I bet you knew him real well.

194
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,888
Old habits die hard, don't they Leo?

195
00:14:05,998 --> 00:14:09,346
You think you're back in Nam,
collecting trophies off the VC!?

196
00:14:09,347 --> 00:14:11,462
Is that what we got going here?

197
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:13,603
It's okay, Leo.
You can tell me.

198
00:14:13,924 --> 00:14:17,058
See, I was there too.
I understand.

199
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,636
- You were there?
- Bet your ass.

200
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:23,024
- Two tours. Airborne. What about you?
- Dog soldier.

201
00:14:23,098 --> 00:14:25,505
I hate the jungle. Snakes.

202
00:14:25,693 --> 00:14:28,770
I hate snakes.
And tunnels, I hate tunnels.

203
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,139
What about cabins, Leo. You like cabins?

204
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,120
Cabins?

205
00:14:32,131 --> 00:14:34,809
You were there, Leo.
In the cabin, with the sword.

206
00:14:35,489 --> 00:14:38,656
Oh, yeah, I was.

207
00:14:38,781 --> 00:14:40,944
- I remember that.
- Yeah, but not everything!

208
00:14:41,044 --> 00:14:44,388
You see, that's why we're here, Leo.
We're trying to help you remember!

209
00:14:45,005 --> 00:14:47,522
Oh yeah, 'cause you
were there: in Nam.

210
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:50,101
Yes, and that's what
you thought too, didn't you?

211
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,864
You were out there on patrol,
weren't you, Leo?

212
00:14:52,907 --> 00:14:55,152
- That's right.
- And you came to the cabin.

213
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:58,222
- Cabin?
- And you went inside with the sword.

214
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:02,749
- I don't remember no swords in Nam.
- But you just said you did!

215
00:15:02,763 --> 00:15:05,595
Hey look, you got to keep it straight, Leo!
I'm trying to help you here!

216
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,455
You're out there on patrol.

217
00:15:08,668 --> 00:15:10,318
You had your sword.

218
00:15:10,597 --> 00:15:12,553
And all of the sudden he was there.

219
00:15:13,408 --> 00:15:15,927
Charlie, the VC.

220
00:15:16,136 --> 00:15:18,991
Yeah, I could smell him.
He was that close.

221
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:20,739
And you were scared.

222
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:22,321
Peeing in my pants.

223
00:15:24,244 --> 00:15:28,182
He was so close, I could reach
out and touch him in the darkness!

224
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,638
And you were so scared, you took
your sword and you swung away.

225
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,261
You killed him.

226
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:37,979
It was "him or you".
I know how it is, Leo.

227
00:15:38,223 --> 00:15:40,516
That's right. Him or me!

228
00:15:40,784 --> 00:15:43,646
Him or me.
Him or me.

229
00:15:43,781 --> 00:15:46,858
Him or me.
Him or me!

230
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:49,476
That's right. Him or me.

231
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,360
Yeah, him or me!

232
00:15:52,457 --> 00:15:53,675
Yeah!

233
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:08,861
I don't see a stop light.

234
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:10,865
I don't even see a stop sign.

235
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,816
Maybe that's why Lucas came here.

236
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:15,760
To do what?
Play bingo and pitch horse shoes?

237
00:16:15,973 --> 00:16:17,062
To live.

238
00:16:17,097 --> 00:16:20,001
To not turn every corner
expecting to meet out destiny.

239
00:16:20,168 --> 00:16:22,615
Sounds like a simple thing to do.

240
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:25,631
To love, hate, drink and dream...

241
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:29,513
about going someplace else.
Someplace better.

242
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:35,076
We are a little philosophical
today, Mac?

243
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:38,402
Lucas just wanted to get away,
try to retire for the Game.

244
00:16:38,491 --> 00:16:40,506
Like you, before the Gathering.

245
00:16:40,969 --> 00:16:42,879
That's what this is all about, isn't it?

246
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,736
One of your guys is out
head-hunting. He finds Lucas...

247
00:16:47,168 --> 00:16:50,440
So you come out here hoping this same
guy comes looking for you, am I right?

248
00:16:51,618 --> 00:16:52,965
Maybe.

249
00:16:54,624 --> 00:16:58,119
- Why do you owe good old Lucas, anyway?
- It's a long story.

250
00:16:58,146 --> 00:17:00,605
Now you know what to do,
go and do it.

251
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:14,877
I could smell him.
I could hear him breathing.

252
00:17:14,982 --> 00:17:17,735
And the sergeant said:
"Leo, take the point!"

253
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:20,592
And I took it.
Down on my belly like a damn snake...

254
00:17:20,627 --> 00:17:22,638
until I ran right into Charlie!

255
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:25,214
I couldn't see him in the dark!

256
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,786
But I tried to tell him...

257
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,478
"Don't do this. Slip away, man!"

258
00:17:31,604 --> 00:17:33,978
"We're both gonna die today!"

259
00:17:34,526 --> 00:17:36,742
But he shot me!

260
00:17:37,245 --> 00:17:39,980
He shot me here on my face!

261
00:17:48,187 --> 00:17:51,662
Leo, come back, man.
Come back!

262
00:17:54,062 --> 00:17:56,304
¡And then everybody was there!

263
00:17:56,322 --> 00:17:58,551
¡Sergeant, Jerry and Al!

264
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,630
They were firing tracers,

265
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,172
like the fourth of July,

266
00:18:03,178 --> 00:18:06,354
like a fountain of fire,
like a helo!

267
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:24,533
And then... then...
and then the chopter came,

268
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,236
and it lifted me out.

269
00:18:32,163 --> 00:18:34,289
I saw it all.

270
00:18:34,641 --> 00:18:36,808
I though I was asleep.

271
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:40,026
Later... later...

272
00:18:40,044 --> 00:18:43,639
they told me that a bullet went
in my brain and made me crazy.

273
00:18:45,066 --> 00:18:48,074
But that ain't so.
I saw it all.

274
00:18:49,384 --> 00:18:51,843
I know what happened.

275
00:18:52,873 --> 00:18:56,183
I so do you. Cause you were there.

276
00:18:57,138 --> 00:18:58,983
- Take it easy...
- You told me you were there!

277
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,127
Take it easy now, soldier.

278
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:04,831
Take it slow.

279
00:19:06,418 --> 00:19:07,914
Yes, sir.

280
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:10,052
Like a...

281
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,904
Like a fiery fountain
on the Fourth of July, you know?

282
00:19:18,084 --> 00:19:20,587
Ok, Leo. Sit here.

283
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,290
It's not him.

284
00:19:58,001 --> 00:20:01,049
Come on, I could've been in New Mexico
in fact by now.

285
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:07,985
Are you doin'
what I think you're doing?

286
00:20:10,486 --> 00:20:14,176
Hi Officer... doing what?

287
00:20:18,974 --> 00:20:20,464
Give me that.

288
00:20:28,752 --> 00:20:30,272
Down here.

289
00:21:24,005 --> 00:21:26,016
This man needs water!

290
00:21:26,893 --> 00:21:29,495
- Hush up, spy!
- He's dying of thirst!

291
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,555
He'll die of more than that
if you don't hush up.

292
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,865
Soldier! At ease!

293
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:48,674
What seems to be
the problem here, corporal?

294
00:21:48,736 --> 00:21:52,330
This'n there Captain, nobody but
a troublemaker and low down abolitionist.

295
00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:55,861
Came in and stole folks niggers
right off the plantations.

296
00:21:55,905 --> 00:21:58,045
They caught him without
a uniform behind our lines.

297
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,547
They's gonna hang him today.

298
00:21:59,573 --> 00:22:01,843
He's wearing a uniform now.

299
00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:04,431
And he will be treated with respect.

300
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:06,947
Give these men
water, and rations.

301
00:22:07,374 --> 00:22:09,580
- But the colonel, he said...
- Now, soldier!

302
00:22:09,735 --> 00:22:11,924
Yes, sir!
By whose orders, sir?

303
00:22:12,261 --> 00:22:14,486
Captain Lucas Desiree.

304
00:22:40,249 --> 00:22:42,691
- I've been here for an hour.
- Reflecting on your sins?

305
00:22:42,726 --> 00:22:44,058
Right, give me out here!

306
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,850
Come on Ryan, I'll process you out.

307
00:22:55,204 --> 00:22:56,675
Leo.

308
00:22:59,948 --> 00:23:01,563
You are my lawyer?

309
00:23:02,203 --> 00:23:04,185
You don't look
like no damn lawyer.

310
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,969
I'm a friend of the man
they say you murdered.

311
00:23:07,124 --> 00:23:08,681
I have murdered nobody.

312
00:23:08,856 --> 00:23:12,186
When I came upon him on the cabin
he was already hacked to pieces!

313
00:23:12,297 --> 00:23:14,173
Like a broken toy soldier.

314
00:23:14,578 --> 00:23:17,569
- Did you see anyone else?
- No.

315
00:23:18,316 --> 00:23:20,251
Only the lightning.

316
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,693
The lightning of his terrible...!

317
00:23:22,815 --> 00:23:24,362
Shut up!

318
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:29,371
Anything else?

319
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:32,149
The sword.

320
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,773
Looked like something
from "Gone with the Wind".

321
00:23:36,674 --> 00:23:39,405
- I'm gonna get you out of here, Leo.
- You and what Army?

322
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,940
Just trust me.

323
00:23:42,524 --> 00:23:44,434
You're a hoot, friend.

324
00:23:44,597 --> 00:23:48,617
Last person said that to me
stole my shoes while I was asleep.

325
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:50,789
- Time before that...
- Hey, you!

326
00:23:51,843 --> 00:23:55,079
- I'll be seeing you, Leo.
- I won't bet on that.

327
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,801
You are a reporter, right?

328
00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:02,452
That "stolen car bull" was just
so you could talk to our prisoner.

329
00:24:02,468 --> 00:24:04,666
No, I'm a friend of Lucas Desiree's.

330
00:24:05,056 --> 00:24:07,585
Was anyone else in town
asking about him before his death?

331
00:24:08,117 --> 00:24:10,092
I think we would have noticed.

332
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:11,961
Would have been hard not to.

333
00:24:12,101 --> 00:24:13,847
Or maybe a stranger passing through.

334
00:24:13,876 --> 00:24:16,228
Only stranger passing through
was the one we caught.

335
00:24:16,392 --> 00:24:18,156
You caught him?

336
00:24:18,394 --> 00:24:20,523
Nope. Sheriff Crowley.

337
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:21,581
Aha.

338
00:24:21,635 --> 00:24:22,654
How?

339
00:24:22,816 --> 00:24:24,313
What do you mean, how?

340
00:24:24,342 --> 00:24:27,549
- He didn't just passed by Lucas' place?
- Never said he did.

341
00:24:27,856 --> 00:24:30,407
Fact is, half a dozen folks
who live up in the Valley...

342
00:24:30,408 --> 00:24:34,268
saw some kind of lightning or electrical
explosion or something about the same time.

343
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,558
- And that brought the Sheriff?
- Yeah.

344
00:24:36,656 --> 00:24:40,227
Around these parts we don't get
too much lightning in a clear blue sky.

345
00:24:41,258 --> 00:24:43,064
What do they think caused it?

346
00:24:43,283 --> 00:24:45,591
Electrical Company
can't say for sure.

347
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,915
Some kind of surge
in a transformer, maybe.

348
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,374
Anyway, like you said that's
probably what brought the sheriff.

349
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:53,727
You weren't with him.

350
00:24:53,941 --> 00:24:55,777
You are a reporter.

351
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,258
Why don't you just say so,
like everyone else?

352
00:24:59,444 --> 00:25:01,887
- Somebody else was asking questions?
- Yes.

353
00:25:02,253 --> 00:25:04,686
But she was a lot prettier than you.

354
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:08,362
SAVE THE LOGGERS.
SHOOT AN ENVIRONMENTALIST.

355
00:25:18,739 --> 00:25:21,655
So you found out for sure
that old Leo isn't an Immortal.

356
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,531
What do you guys got, anyway?
A secret handshake?

357
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:28,860
- A tattoo.
- Really? Where?

358
00:25:28,921 --> 00:25:31,314
We know how to handle
some psycho killer up here.

359
00:25:31,378 --> 00:25:34,415
- How's that, Bob?
- Well, I'll tell you what we wouldn't do.

360
00:25:34,904 --> 00:25:38,305
We wouldn't like some environmentalist
sensitive public defender...

361
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:43,047
get him off on an insanity plea
because he had too much sugar in his diet.

362
00:25:44,616 --> 00:25:47,300
Could I get an orange juice
and a Coke, please?

363
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:49,902
- Yeah.
- Isn’t that right, friend?

364
00:25:50,972 --> 00:25:52,935
You look like you would know.

365
00:25:52,961 --> 00:25:55,359
You look like you've got
too much time on your hands.

366
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,622
You know what I bet
we got here...

367
00:25:58,105 --> 00:26:01,165
I bet we got another bird watcher.

368
00:26:01,218 --> 00:26:05,301
Another Spotted Owl lover
come up here to save the environment.

369
00:26:06,061 --> 00:26:08,070
Put a lot of good men outta work.

370
00:26:08,094 --> 00:26:09,298
Give it a rest.

371
00:26:09,313 --> 00:26:13,811
I'll tell you something: You know, one of us
will be happy to hire out as a guide.

372
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:17,806
We'll take you right back into the forest
right to them damned spotted owls,

373
00:26:18,032 --> 00:26:20,095
Won't be boys?

374
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:22,741
Yeah.

375
00:26:22,853 --> 00:26:25,202
Somebody starts playing a banjo,
I'm outta here.

376
00:26:25,226 --> 00:26:26,832
What's that?

377
00:26:27,645 --> 00:26:29,936
It's a... nice hat.

378
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,745
My favorite team.

379
00:26:35,363 --> 00:26:37,526
What do you want, tourist?

380
00:26:39,243 --> 00:26:40,798
Just something to eat.

381
00:26:42,828 --> 00:26:45,073
I'm sorry if the mill closed,
or the wells dried up,

382
00:26:45,113 --> 00:26:48,696
or the grasshoppers ate your crop
or your life isn't what you hoped it to be.

383
00:26:48,719 --> 00:26:53,094
But I'm a friend of Lucas Desiree's and
we're just here to find out how he died.

384
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:59,123
Now, don't you feel even
more stupid than usual, Bob?

385
00:27:04,655 --> 00:27:06,654
What the hell are you lookin' at?

386
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:09,331
See you, Bob.

387
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:12,056
We're all real sorry about
what happened, honey.

388
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,218
Doesn't make a bit of sense.
Everybody liked him.

389
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:18,817
He kept to himself
and was polite to a fault.

390
00:27:18,852 --> 00:27:20,187
You knew him?

391
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:23,146
Oh no, nobody really knew him.

392
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,112
He came in here for food and supplies.

393
00:27:27,095 --> 00:27:29,190
He was a real gentleman.

394
00:27:29,351 --> 00:27:31,220
Yes, he was.

395
00:27:31,434 --> 00:27:33,427
Don't you ever get hungry?

396
00:27:36,677 --> 00:27:40,887
Thanks. What's the special?

397
00:27:41,394 --> 00:27:44,189
Nothing's ever special here.
Try the meat loaf.

398
00:27:44,653 --> 00:27:46,469
No, I'll try number four.

399
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,599
And I would like the...

400
00:27:49,923 --> 00:27:55,483
cheeseburger, but with processed cheese
and sweet pickles on the side.

401
00:27:56,761 --> 00:28:01,376
Tomato, lettuce, onion,
ketchup, mustard...

402
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:05,325
Look, how many ways can I say "No Comment"
before I bore you, Ms. McFarland?

403
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:08,905
Look, no microphone, no hidden camera.
Just on background, sergeant.

404
00:28:09,051 --> 00:28:11,185
Look, this is the early stage
of our investigation and we...

405
00:28:11,275 --> 00:28:14,391
Aha! So you're investigating the
beheading in the city a while back.

406
00:28:14,424 --> 00:28:16,621
I mean, why else would you come
clear up to the boonies?

407
00:28:17,142 --> 00:28:19,571
Steepston isn't the boonies,
Ms. McFarland.

408
00:28:19,918 --> 00:28:23,125
It's the sticks...
right before the boonies.

409
00:28:23,471 --> 00:28:25,256
- Any leads on the suspect?
- No...

410
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,268
...comment, I know. And I understand and
I appreciate your need for discretion.

411
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:32,044
So, if everything I've just suggested is true
just say "no comment". I'll understand.

412
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:37,932
Look, I may be taking a suspect back
with me for a psychiatric evaluation.

413
00:28:37,964 --> 00:28:40,819
Check back then,
I'll give you whatever I can.

414
00:28:40,854 --> 00:28:43,113
You're on my Christmas list, Powell.

415
00:28:43,629 --> 00:28:45,446
Isn't that nice?

416
00:28:46,442 --> 00:28:48,581
...extra mayo and not that light stuff.

417
00:28:48,609 --> 00:28:51,563
Only the real stuff. I you got only
the light stuff, forget about it.

418
00:28:52,193 --> 00:28:55,983
And I would like that well-done with...

419
00:28:56,217 --> 00:28:58,913
onions rings and French
fries on the side.

420
00:28:59,801 --> 00:29:04,239
You know something? I'm gonna spurt,
actually. Make that a double.

421
00:29:04,725 --> 00:29:06,917
Salad and cheeseburger.

422
00:29:07,868 --> 00:29:11,568
- He'd just know that's what I want, right?
- Oh, yeah.

423
00:29:12,634 --> 00:29:14,790
Did he have any friends
here in Steepston?

424
00:29:16,022 --> 00:29:18,580
He got along with
the old sheriff real good.

425
00:29:19,004 --> 00:29:23,387
Used to play chess every...
Friday night right over that table.

426
00:29:23,816 --> 00:29:25,443
Really?

427
00:29:25,595 --> 00:29:27,464
With Sheriff Crowley?

428
00:29:27,671 --> 00:29:29,537
Oh no, old Nate Perkins.

429
00:29:29,574 --> 00:29:31,819
He retired and moved
to Florida a few years back.

430
00:29:32,045 --> 00:29:35,419
Since then, Lucas kept pretty much
to himself. Hardly ever saw him.

431
00:29:35,459 --> 00:29:37,710
I guess Sheriff Crowley
wasn't much for chess.

432
00:29:37,761 --> 00:29:40,205
Who knows. There's another one
who keeps to himself.

433
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:43,992
Get's along well enough with the
likes of LeMoyne, but he's a loner.

434
00:29:45,589 --> 00:29:48,560
Well respected though.
Nobody messes with the sheriff.

435
00:29:48,648 --> 00:29:50,116
Not even Lucas?

436
00:29:50,317 --> 00:29:54,102
Lucas? I don't think I ever saw
the two of them together in the same room.

437
00:29:54,986 --> 00:29:57,323
I got the feeling they wanted it that way.

438
00:30:09,264 --> 00:30:12,737
I still don't understand why you changed
your mind. I though you wanted help.

439
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:14,956
I naturally assumed that
a big city force...

440
00:30:15,057 --> 00:30:17,530
would do a better job
conducting an interrogation.

441
00:30:17,674 --> 00:30:20,886
You fell for his "crazy Leo" act
like a catfish to a stinkbait.

442
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:22,977
Let's let a psychiatrist
decide that.

443
00:30:22,978 --> 00:30:26,234
In my professional opinion,
Leo didn't behead anybody.

444
00:30:26,388 --> 00:30:28,798
And our lab found no trace
of the victim's blood,

445
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,479
not even microscopic particles on
the sword you recovered from the cabin.

446
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,012
Maybe there was another weapon.

447
00:30:34,105 --> 00:30:36,215
You said you showed up on
the scene moments later.

448
00:30:36,229 --> 00:30:38,398
What'd Leo do
with the other sword, swallow it?

449
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:40,784
Now look, he is what
he says he is:

450
00:30:40,824 --> 00:30:44,194
A guy who staggered into
the wrong place at the wrong time.

451
00:30:45,035 --> 00:30:48,996
I'm afraid that won't wash with
the good people of Steepston County.

452
00:30:49,035 --> 00:30:51,415
I've got a valid
psychiatric warrant for him.

453
00:30:51,623 --> 00:30:54,916
You tell the good people of Steepston
it's out of your jurisdiction.

454
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,986
Not until you're over the County line.

455
00:30:58,347 --> 00:31:00,810
You know what route to take, ah?

456
00:31:01,396 --> 00:31:03,228
Look, I don't need his help.

457
00:31:03,285 --> 00:31:05,823
He's gonna show you a back way
out of the county.

458
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:08,570
I don't need any trouble
on my watch.

459
00:31:09,525 --> 00:31:12,211
- Okay, let's go.
- You're not taking your car?

460
00:31:12,668 --> 00:31:15,020
Not, I think I'll ride with Leo.

461
00:31:15,318 --> 00:31:18,440
See, I'm such a city fella, I might
just get lost on these back roads.

462
00:31:19,381 --> 00:31:21,141
I'll send somebody back for my car.

463
00:31:21,242 --> 00:31:23,794
You do that.
No bother at all.

464
00:31:42,624 --> 00:31:45,555
Diner? Speak up.

465
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:47,167
Who?

466
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:49,278
Tommy Riley, it's for you.

467
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:52,220
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

468
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,132
He mumbled so bad
I couldn't understand him.

469
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:55,131
Hello?

470
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:58,433
- So, you ok?
- Yup, thanks.

471
00:32:06,219 --> 00:32:08,198
Tommy, you intend
to pay for these?

472
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:09,986
Put it on my tab.

473
00:32:10,018 --> 00:32:12,540
Yeah, yeah.
Put it on the tab.

474
00:32:13,095 --> 00:32:15,558
By the way, they're taking the guy
they say killed your friend...

475
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,922
down south
for a psychiatric evaluation.

476
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,982
Sounds fair, Gwenn.

477
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,196
Yeah, if somebody
doesn't hang him first.

478
00:33:26,852 --> 00:33:29,216
I'm Duncan MacLeod,
of the clan MacLeod.

479
00:33:29,698 --> 00:33:31,118
Thanks.

480
00:33:31,229 --> 00:33:33,403
Good thing they buried
you way out here.

481
00:33:33,437 --> 00:33:35,100
Not too crowded.

482
00:33:35,253 --> 00:33:38,993
If I hadn't happened by today, you could
have stayed under there for quite a spell.

483
00:33:39,013 --> 00:33:41,547
Some would think this was
a good time to take my head, Lucas.

484
00:33:41,562 --> 00:33:43,793
Some would, I expect.

485
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:47,822
It was hard hanging you,

486
00:33:48,098 --> 00:33:49,835
even knowing what I knew.

487
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:55,899
- The others seemed to enjoy it.
- You stole their slaves.

488
00:33:56,237 --> 00:33:58,250
You're destroying their way of life.

489
00:33:58,419 --> 00:34:00,693
Revenge is all they have left.

490
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,897
You follow that road North
to your lines.

491
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,293
I just might follow it myself, one day.

492
00:34:09,483 --> 00:34:11,984
You're on the wrong side,
you know that, Lucas.

493
00:34:12,154 --> 00:34:15,141
Oh, we just get attached
to the people, don't we?

494
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:18,888
Lot of good folks down here.
Friends.

495
00:34:19,764 --> 00:34:22,399
Loyalty is a real funny thing.

496
00:34:22,471 --> 00:34:24,939
Probably causes
as much harm as does good.

497
00:34:25,906 --> 00:34:27,067
Yes sir...

498
00:34:27,518 --> 00:34:30,614
I think I'll up and follow
that road North one day.

499
00:34:31,315 --> 00:34:33,384
I'll look forward to that.

500
00:34:40,049 --> 00:34:42,694
Be dark soon.
You'd best be going now.

501
00:34:59,647 --> 00:35:02,572
So, he says: shut up,
they're coming closer!

502
00:35:35,381 --> 00:35:37,162
Easy boys.

503
00:35:53,052 --> 00:35:56,155
- I don't believe we've met.
- I know who you are.

504
00:35:56,201 --> 00:35:59,241
If you're here for the hunting,
the season's just opened.

505
00:36:00,569 --> 00:36:03,513
He claims to be a friend
of Lucas Desiree, Sheriff.

506
00:36:03,546 --> 00:36:05,908
- Is that a fact?
- That's a fact.

507
00:36:06,141 --> 00:36:09,424
We heard that big city detective
is taking the bum back with him.

508
00:36:09,678 --> 00:36:11,740
Wish I could tell you different, Bob.

509
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:15,101
City folks just don't see things
as clear as you and I.

510
00:36:15,724 --> 00:36:17,442
Makes a man lose hope.

511
00:36:17,449 --> 00:36:20,694
To an outsider it might seem like you want
these men to do something about it.

512
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:24,381
Do? Have I asked you
boys to do anything?

513
00:36:25,323 --> 00:36:28,370
I'm just informing
the most concern citizens.

514
00:36:29,677 --> 00:36:31,947
We do appreciate that, Sheriff.

515
00:36:32,028 --> 00:36:34,499
We just might voice our concern.

516
00:36:34,512 --> 00:36:36,544
That's very civic minded of you.

517
00:36:37,305 --> 00:36:39,159
Let's go, boys.

518
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,922
Well, got to run.

519
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,320
I suppose I'll be
seeing you again.

520
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:55,154
Your friend Lucas died
on his knees begging for his life.

521
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:03,566
We'll see how you do.

522
00:37:33,121 --> 00:37:35,731
- Looks like we missed them.
- What do we do now?

523
00:37:35,877 --> 00:37:37,876
I though we were jamming.

524
00:37:39,274 --> 00:37:41,306
Nobody's told them Leo is gone.

525
00:37:41,601 --> 00:37:43,516
So they got a bad tip.

526
00:37:45,672 --> 00:37:47,329
Is she your type?

527
00:37:50,174 --> 00:37:52,571
- Definitely.
- Good.

528
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:04,655
- Can I help you with something?
- No, no, no.

529
00:38:05,318 --> 00:38:08,150
Just thought you might be here
to interview that bum, Leo Atkins.

530
00:38:08,294 --> 00:38:10,277
- Yes, so...
- I don't know...

531
00:38:10,334 --> 00:38:12,244
He might not make it out
of Steepston County.

532
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,299
You got a police scanner, right?

533
00:38:18,995 --> 00:38:21,078
- Let's go find 'em.
- Let's go.

534
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,097
What's this?

535
00:38:37,127 --> 00:38:39,421
Looks like somebody broke down.

536
00:38:39,656 --> 00:38:40,679
Hey, don't go out there.

537
00:38:40,714 --> 00:38:43,094
Hey, around these parts
we like try and help out.

538
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:48,894
Struthers, get back in here!

539
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,279
That's enough!

540
00:39:08,408 --> 00:39:12,279
We don't want to hurt you, officer. Just
give us the psycho and we'll be on our way.

541
00:39:12,292 --> 00:39:15,515
That's not going to happen.
Get back in your trucks and go.

542
00:39:15,857 --> 00:39:16,727
Now!

543
00:39:16,728 --> 00:39:18,931
You're not in the big city
now, detective.

544
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:21,451
What're you gonna do,
call for backup?

545
00:39:23,202 --> 00:39:25,240
Now, this is the last time
I'm gonna ask nice.

546
00:39:25,241 --> 00:39:27,280
You did your job. Now give him up.

547
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,710
Come on, all we want is the guy.

548
00:39:31,732 --> 00:39:33,324
We'll let you go.

549
00:39:34,061 --> 00:39:35,750
Just give him to us, right?

550
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,945
Is this a breaking story,
or what?

551
00:39:40,951 --> 00:39:43,322
- Roll tape, Frank.
- You looking to die, friend.

552
00:39:43,475 --> 00:39:46,371
Put that camera down!
I said put it down!

553
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,148
Macleod.

554
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,263
Go ahead, shoot him.

555
00:39:57,481 --> 00:39:58,967
Shoot her, shoot the boy,

556
00:39:59,023 --> 00:40:02,334
the officer or me. That's
your idea of justice, isn't it?

557
00:40:02,756 --> 00:40:03,963
Isn't it?

558
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:09,177
Go home!

559
00:40:10,258 --> 00:40:11,652
All of you!

560
00:40:12,973 --> 00:40:15,533
Crawl back under the rocks
you came from.

561
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:18,947
It's over!

562
00:40:19,675 --> 00:40:21,309
Let's go, boys.

563
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:24,149
And take this disgrace
to the badge with you!

564
00:40:29,665 --> 00:40:32,117
What in the hell
are you doing here?

565
00:40:32,732 --> 00:40:34,806
I think some people want to talk to you.

566
00:40:37,585 --> 00:40:40,920
...here with Sergeant Powell,
who has just stood off a mob...

567
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:44,584
of masked men intent on taking
the law into their own hands.

568
00:40:45,049 --> 00:40:46,470
You've a statement,
Sergeant Powell?

569
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:47,534
Later.

570
00:40:48,278 --> 00:40:51,437
Hey, hey. Hey. You owe me, Powell.

571
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:54,029
Or didn't you notice?

572
00:40:54,899 --> 00:40:57,170
I suspect collusion
by the local authorities...

573
00:40:57,184 --> 00:40:59,340
in the attempted abduction
of Leo Atkins.

574
00:40:59,461 --> 00:41:02,224
They clearly made an attempt
to violate due process...

575
00:41:02,246 --> 00:41:05,989
and the suspects civil rights.
I'll be asking the FBI to look into this.

576
00:41:07,515 --> 00:41:09,973
Thank you, Sergeant Powell.

577
00:41:11,113 --> 00:41:13,264
You really were there.
You were there.

578
00:41:13,974 --> 00:41:15,213
Going home, Leo.

579
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:17,649
The other hero
of this amazing encounter...

580
00:41:17,669 --> 00:41:19,858
is a mysterious man...

581
00:41:20,582 --> 00:41:22,674
- Where the hell is he?
- I don't know.

582
00:41:42,714 --> 00:41:44,660
You couldn't let him live in peace.

583
00:41:44,928 --> 00:41:46,264
That's all he wanted.

584
00:41:46,392 --> 00:41:48,469
Wasn't very ambitious, was he?

585
00:41:48,785 --> 00:41:50,226
Why Leo?

586
00:41:50,444 --> 00:41:53,049
People in a small town like to talk.

587
00:41:53,324 --> 00:41:55,330
If they don't get a fix
on who did what,

588
00:41:55,633 --> 00:41:57,779
they keep picking at it like a scab.

589
00:41:57,801 --> 00:41:59,821
Eventually, they would
have figured it out.

590
00:42:00,973 --> 00:42:03,756
People aren't as dumb
as we wish they were.

591
00:42:07,348 --> 00:42:10,176
I was starting to like it here.

592
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,518
Now I'll have to move on.

593
00:42:15,664 --> 00:42:18,224
But you're staying here.

594
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:21,350
I guess one of us is.

595
00:43:04,769 --> 00:43:06,656
In the future...

596
00:43:06,859 --> 00:43:09,877
I'll remember to leave
your friends in peace.

597
00:43:10,309 --> 00:43:11,814
What future?

598
00:43:45,557 --> 00:43:47,593
I guess I've got
all I need for now.

599
00:43:47,936 --> 00:43:50,432
- You might get called as a witness.
- I'm sure.

600
00:43:50,787 --> 00:43:52,533
Did they ever find that sheriff?

601
00:43:52,534 --> 00:43:54,445
Disappeared
off the face of the Earth.

602
00:43:54,807 --> 00:43:57,023
- The FBI will find him.
- What about Leo?

603
00:43:57,637 --> 00:44:00,350
He's out in the car.
I'm taking him to the Bus station.

604
00:44:00,861 --> 00:44:02,479
Excuse me,

605
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:04,789
I don't mean to bother you folks,

606
00:44:05,794 --> 00:44:08,653
but I seen the sign out front,

607
00:44:09,026 --> 00:44:12,984
I was wondering if you bought
old medals and such.

608
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:14,815
I'm a little short.

609
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:20,246
- That's yours?
- That's right.

610
00:44:20,406 --> 00:44:22,704
I figure I can sell it if I want to.

611
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:25,235
Well, I don't think
I can buy it from you, Leo.

612
00:44:25,659 --> 00:44:27,133
But I might be able to...

613
00:44:27,304 --> 00:44:29,614
lend you something against it
until you come back this way.

614
00:44:29,929 --> 00:44:30,899
Deal.

615
00:44:47,357 --> 00:44:50,041
This antique business
is a going concern.

616
00:44:51,504 --> 00:44:53,781
I should've got rid
of that long time ago.

617
00:44:54,212 --> 00:44:56,711
Don't do not good
to hang on to the past.

618
00:44:57,024 --> 00:44:59,273
More that one day
in a man's lifetime.

619
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:04,079
Well, I got a bus to catch.

620
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,746
I'll give you a ride to the Station.

621
00:45:05,987 --> 00:45:07,703
- Take care, Leo
- Bye.

622
00:45:08,012 --> 00:45:09,056
Bye, Leo.

623
00:45:09,179 --> 00:45:10,636
Thank you.

624
00:45:22,149 --> 00:45:24,338
You think they're going
to find the sheriff?

625
00:45:25,874 --> 00:45:27,319
Eventually.

626
00:45:27,356 --> 00:45:28,787
What about Lucas?

627
00:45:29,032 --> 00:45:30,440
I took care of him.

628
00:45:58,134 --> 00:46:01,169
