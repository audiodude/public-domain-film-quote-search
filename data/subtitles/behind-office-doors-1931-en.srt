2
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,300
Cut it out, Dolores!

3
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,101
Come on in, Mary. We're playing
Blind Man's Buff and you're it.

4
00:02:01,192 --> 00:02:02,400
Wait a minute.

5
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,400
You've got to pay me first.

6
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:08,000
Always it's the woman who pays,
and pays, and pays.

7
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:09,801
You think that?

8
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,402
Hey, that's enough of this
come on, leave her alone.

9
00:02:13,423 --> 00:02:15,300
- What's the matter with you.
- Give me a break,

10
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,631
Give you a break, I'll break your neck,

11
00:02:16,652 --> 00:02:20,200
Hey, Kogan!
Pipe down them flaming youth...

12
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:22,300
or find yourself another flat!

13
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:24,400
This ain't no speakeasy!

14
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:28,300
I know it's the Biltmore, but who moved
it over here to 3rd Avenue?

15
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:35,600
She's funny that way.
Let's pipe down.

16
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:37,501
Come on, Mary, give me your coat.

17
00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:39,032
Hello, Mary, how are you?

18
00:02:39,053 --> 00:02:41,233
Hello, Mary, what took you so long?

19
00:02:41,254 --> 00:02:44,934
Listen, I know a good quiet game,
if you boys won't dirty it up.

20
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:47,335
- Oh, no, we won't.
- Let's play Truth.

21
00:02:47,356 --> 00:02:49,636
- What's Truth?
- It's a big moment for the boys.

22
00:02:49,657 --> 00:02:53,700
They can ask you any question they like
and you have to tell the truth.

23
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:55,801
Whoopee, that's my game!

24
00:02:56,202 --> 00:02:58,300
Ah, local boy gets a break.

25
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:00,701
I'm going to be dumb and not
learn how.

26
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:07,700
- Come on, Mary, you take a chance.
- Not me, I'm not here.

27
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:09,701
Oh, you...

28
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:15,102
It's gonna be good,
if you know what I mean.

29
00:03:15,503 --> 00:03:17,003
Come on, now.

30
00:03:19,204 --> 00:03:21,304
Well, who are you?

31
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:23,705
The name is Mary.

32
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:25,106
And who is Mary?

33
00:03:25,137 --> 00:03:26,707
A working girl.

34
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,708
The kind that heaven protects?

35
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:32,209
Up to now.

36
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,770
Oh!

37
00:03:34,971 --> 00:03:37,271
- In love?
- Sure.

38
00:03:37,872 --> 00:03:39,272
Who with?

39
00:03:39,673 --> 00:03:41,273
A man.

40
00:03:41,574 --> 00:03:42,874
What's his name?

41
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,075
Even a census taker wouldn't ask
a question like that.

42
00:03:47,176 --> 00:03:49,000
Guess that'll hold you for a couple.

43
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:54,900
Pass her by, handsome,
I'm a grass widow.

44
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,401
You can go as far as you like.

45
00:03:58,402 --> 00:04:00,202
I'll go.

46
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:01,700
Pardon me.

47
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:13,200
The villain still persues her.

48
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:16,900
Say, that's a swell way to get
acquainted, that game.

49
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:18,999
Let's go a step further.

50
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,700
I'll buy your violets.

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,300
Who's the lucky man?

52
00:04:41,341 --> 00:04:42,701
The one you're in love with.

53
00:04:43,302 --> 00:04:45,200
He's a big paper man.

54
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:47,501
All wrapped up on your boss,
I know.

55
00:04:47,622 --> 00:04:49,600
You should see my boss.

56
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:53,101
He's so old that short skirts
came in twenty years too late...

57
00:04:53,132 --> 00:04:55,102
for him to appreciate legs.

58
00:04:57,503 --> 00:04:59,103
Even yours?

59
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:02,704
- My turn now.
- Shoot.

60
00:05:03,905 --> 00:05:07,705
Name, color, present condition
of servitude.

61
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:12,200
Ronald Wales, white, poor, honest.

62
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:16,201
Ambition? Not to have to work
for a living.

63
00:05:16,702 --> 00:05:19,102
So I can go to the south
of France and write a book.

64
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:24,600
What do you do for a living besides
kissing strange girls in hallways?

65
00:05:24,621 --> 00:05:26,601
I work in a broker's office.

66
00:05:26,902 --> 00:05:30,602
- In love?
- I am not.

67
00:05:31,403 --> 00:05:32,803
Married then.

68
00:05:32,894 --> 00:05:34,804
I don't believe in marriage.

69
00:05:35,205 --> 00:05:37,305
That's not a new line.

70
00:05:38,206 --> 00:05:40,106
Well, now it's my turn.

71
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:49,507
Did you like my kissing you?

72
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,008
We're playing truth, you know.

73
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:57,809
Yes.

74
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,600
And yet you say you're in love
with another man.

75
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:06,001
A man who calls you Miss Landy
when your name is Linden...

76
00:06:06,062 --> 00:06:08,602
obviously isn't on kissing terms.

77
00:06:08,753 --> 00:06:11,103
And I'm human, believe it or not.

78
00:06:13,604 --> 00:06:17,700
I believe it so completely that I'm going
to stake you to another little kiss.

79
00:06:18,101 --> 00:06:19,500
Do I have to?

80
00:06:19,601 --> 00:06:21,101
You do.

81
00:06:22,202 --> 00:06:25,602
Well! Far be it from me, dearie,

82
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:29,103
but Freddie has established illegal
relations with the drugstore...

83
00:06:29,154 --> 00:06:31,704
and the gin awaits without.

84
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:33,505
Without us.

85
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:38,050
He can finish telling you the story
of his life in the kitchen.

86
00:06:38,071 --> 00:06:40,661
I'd be just as safe right here
in the bedroom.

87
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:45,200
Yes, but with you two in the kitchen,
a girl can powder her nose.

88
00:06:45,601 --> 00:06:47,001
Come on.

89
00:07:05,902 --> 00:07:08,999
Good night, Ronnie.

90
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,100
You must come to the races
with us again sometime.

91
00:07:14,131 --> 00:07:15,301
I'd love to.

92
00:07:18,102 --> 00:07:23,802
- Good Night, Miss uh... Landy.
- Linden, you fool, her name is Linden.

93
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:27,500
I know, but Mary likes men who
forget her name.

94
00:07:29,101 --> 00:07:31,101
Good night, Dolores.
Good night, Mary.

95
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:33,602
Oh, scurry.

96
00:07:41,103 --> 00:07:45,203
You certainly fell for Ronnie like the
breaking up of a hard winter.

97
00:07:46,004 --> 00:07:48,304
In the first place, I didn't.

98
00:07:48,605 --> 00:07:51,650
In the second place, what's it matter
when he's just a handsome young Romeo...

99
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:55,500
with literary ambitions that make him
of practically no use to a girl?

100
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:57,601
Say that again.

101
00:07:57,802 --> 00:08:01,100
He's just a poor, harmless,
charming young idiot...

102
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:03,901
who thinks that marriage would ruin
him as an author.

103
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:07,700
Ronnie Wales is worth
two million dollars.

104
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:09,800
- What?
- Nice, isn't it?

105
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:13,551
But call your shots, Mary.
I hear his wife's nice too.

106
00:08:14,552 --> 00:08:16,252
His wife?

107
00:08:16,253 --> 00:08:18,253
I hear the kids are grand.

108
00:08:18,284 --> 00:08:20,444
Twins. Boys.

109
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:22,245
What a man.

110
00:08:23,146 --> 00:08:25,446
Well, what a sap I've been.

111
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:28,150
But why would he want to give me
a song and dance like that?

112
00:08:28,151 --> 00:08:31,151
Oh, some say their wives
are in to it.

113
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:34,400
Some say their wives don't
understand them

114
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:38,701
And some just say they're
not married.

115
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,702
Ritter and Company.
Just a minute, please.

116
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,902
Ritter and Company.

117
00:09:12,903 --> 00:09:16,963
Oh, Mary. I forgot to send that wire
to the Wisconsin Mills.

118
00:09:16,984 --> 00:09:19,554
- I'll send it after lunch.
- Oh, that's fine.

119
00:09:20,955 --> 00:09:25,005
Say, you know I forgot all about
that sales meeting tomorrow?

120
00:09:25,026 --> 00:09:26,800
The sales department has been notified.

121
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:28,951
Ritter and Company.
Just a minute, please.

122
00:09:28,972 --> 00:09:30,632
Dolores, you never forget
anything, do you?

123
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,000
- You do, though.
- What now, Mary?

124
00:09:34,734 --> 00:09:37,944
Oh, my medicine. Well, I forgot
that purposefully.

125
00:09:37,965 --> 00:09:40,145
- You take it when you get home.
- Yeah, yeah, all right.

126
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,346
Good night, Mr. Ritter.

127
00:09:53,947 --> 00:09:55,680
You can go on, Dolores. I'll straighten
out the board.

128
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:57,800
- I have to stay a few minutes anyway.
- Thanks, Mary.

129
00:09:57,851 --> 00:09:59,531
- Good night, Dolores.
- Good night.

130
00:09:59,553 --> 00:10:01,100
There's only one trunk busy.

131
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:05,001
That sheik in the sales department's trying
to talk another blond out on a date.

132
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:11,852
Ritter and Company.

133
00:10:11,873 --> 00:10:15,350
Listen, Ed. She's got one of the swellest
figures you ever looked at.

134
00:10:15,371 --> 00:10:17,551
I don't care anything about
her swell figure.

135
00:10:17,572 --> 00:10:20,252
All I want to know is has she
got a friend.

136
00:10:29,053 --> 00:10:30,553
Do you pack a gun, girlie?

137
00:10:33,254 --> 00:10:34,999
Oh, Mr. Duneen.

138
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,200
- Well, well, well, it's Miss, uh...
- Linden.

139
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:41,800
Sure, Linden.

140
00:10:41,831 --> 00:10:44,000
Would you mind waiting a few moments
in the sales department?

141
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:45,700
Always glad to oblige.

142
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:12,300
Well, how are the old man's arteries?

143
00:11:12,321 --> 00:11:15,000
And when's the old duck going to pass
out to give us young fellows a chance?

144
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:18,800
Mr. Ritter's going to be on hand longer
than some of the rest of us perhaps.

145
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:22,300
There's a dirty crack in that somewheres
but Duneen passes it by.

146
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:24,300
The name is Mary, isn't it?

147
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:28,201
Why don't we get the Crown
Publishing Company's account?

148
00:11:28,232 --> 00:11:30,702
Office hours are from nine
to five thirty.

149
00:11:31,103 --> 00:11:33,103
Did you ever try wearing your hair
a little fluffier?

150
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:36,900
How close have you come to getting
together with the Crown people?

151
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:40,301
Say, listen, if I can't sell them,
they can't be sold.

152
00:11:40,342 --> 00:11:42,902
Run your handsome blues eyes
down that.

153
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:47,800
Hmm, this seems to be a confidential
memorandum...

154
00:11:47,844 --> 00:11:50,304
of the Crown's yearly requirements.

155
00:11:50,505 --> 00:11:53,605
They'll take that order at 3,5%
off list.

156
00:11:53,636 --> 00:11:57,106
Yeah? Then I'll buy $20 gold pieces
for 19 bucks.

157
00:11:57,407 --> 00:12:01,500
Mr. Ritter is going to offer the Crown
people 3,5% off for that order tomorrow.

158
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:02,521
Say, listen...

159
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,722
Ritter wouldn't offer 3,5% off a...

160
00:12:08,123 --> 00:12:10,723
You know, that's a remarkable
coincidence.

161
00:12:10,794 --> 00:12:13,224
That's my idea exactly.

162
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:16,225
In fact, I was going to sell him
the model in this combination...

163
00:12:16,246 --> 00:12:18,626
first thing in the morning and send it
forward to prove it.

164
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:20,400
Then I've just been wasting
your time.

165
00:12:20,421 --> 00:12:23,201
Not at all, girlie, not at all.

166
00:12:23,902 --> 00:12:27,332
You meant well. I was just ahead
of you, that's all.

167
00:12:28,553 --> 00:12:31,500
Mr. Bronson lives at 478, Park Avenue.

168
00:12:31,521 --> 00:12:35,101
He left his office about ten minutes ago.
You can catch him if you go right after him.

169
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:38,052
Consider that Duneen is on his way.

170
00:12:38,073 --> 00:12:39,800
But why the night work, girlie?

171
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:42,801
Well, Mr. Ritter not being in
your confidence...

172
00:12:42,832 --> 00:12:46,800
is going to personally telephone Mr. Bronson
that discount at 8:30 a.m.

173
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,200
And you won't get credit for the order.

174
00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:51,900
Hey!

175
00:12:53,301 --> 00:12:55,800
Let me know when I can do you
a favor sometime.

176
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:59,301
- You can do me one right now.
- Name it, girlie.

177
00:13:00,402 --> 00:13:03,442
Try and remember that my name
is Linden.

178
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:05,300
Of course it's Linden.

179
00:13:05,361 --> 00:13:07,000
Hey, plug me in on the switchboard,
will you?

180
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:08,901
I want to break a blonde's heart.

181
00:13:08,992 --> 00:13:11,802
You big businessmen are so brutal.

182
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,550
I know I shouldn't have listened,
but at the same time...

183
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:35,181
little girls shouldn't give away
confidential tips to cheap salesmen.

184
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:37,832
Why not give an ambitious
youngster a break?

185
00:13:37,863 --> 00:13:39,900
Jim Duneen is no good.

186
00:13:39,931 --> 00:13:43,500
Hold your job long enough and you'll see
Jim Duneen as head of this company.

187
00:13:44,101 --> 00:13:49,400
Out of this city of 6 million people,
why do you have to pick him?

188
00:13:50,601 --> 00:13:53,101
You weren't here when I first started
two years ago.

189
00:13:54,102 --> 00:13:58,202
It was my first job.
I was scared to death.

190
00:13:58,803 --> 00:14:01,100
I would have run away if it hadn't
been for Jim Duneen.

191
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:05,000
What did he do? Offer to show you
the pictures in his flat?

192
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:08,801
He found me crying in the hall.

193
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:11,102
Kidded me along.

194
00:14:11,103 --> 00:14:13,003
Told me to keep up a bluff.

195
00:14:13,804 --> 00:14:16,204
Everybody in the world was bluffing.

196
00:14:17,505 --> 00:14:20,605
Well, he don't look like no
big brother to me.

197
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:24,400
So I just tried to pay him back
for how he helped me.

198
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:25,999
You're goofy about him.

199
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,000
Maybe.

200
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:31,101
He don't even know you wear
silk stockings.

201
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:35,300
I'm protecting my job too.

202
00:14:35,331 --> 00:14:37,700
Someday Jim will be the boss here.

203
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:45,701
Good night, chummy.

204
00:14:54,502 --> 00:14:57,402
Ronnie called you five times today.

205
00:14:57,443 --> 00:14:59,103
Did he?

206
00:14:59,134 --> 00:15:03,704
When a girl gets a sweet opening like Ronnie
she ought to cut herself a piece of cake.

207
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:05,500
How do you go about that
sort of thing?

208
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:08,401
Call him up and tell him you've picked
out a swell apartment?

209
00:15:09,102 --> 00:15:13,500
You don't do anything,
you just drift... smilingly.

210
00:15:13,801 --> 00:15:17,101
I'm no drifter. I swim.

211
00:15:17,502 --> 00:15:19,702
Upstream, if necessary.

212
00:15:19,903 --> 00:15:22,000
You darn fool.

213
00:15:33,301 --> 00:15:37,101
Well, John, you need to take
a trip to Europe now...

214
00:15:37,902 --> 00:15:41,200
or in about a year from now
you'll take a ride in a hearse.

215
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:44,500
- Why... as bad as that?
- Hm-hmm.

216
00:15:44,551 --> 00:15:47,000
Yes?
Just a minute.

217
00:15:47,152 --> 00:15:49,300
- Mr. Robinson.
- Tell him to come in, Mary.

218
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:52,300
Look here, John, you can't see
anybody else today.

219
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:55,500
Oh, this is my banker.
He won't get me excited.

220
00:15:55,541 --> 00:16:00,101
Well, all right. Now, remember,
you give up business immediately.

221
00:16:00,122 --> 00:16:01,222
Yes, yes...

222
00:16:02,823 --> 00:16:04,723
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, doctor.

223
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:06,900
- Well!
- Hello, Ritter, how are you?

224
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:09,401
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

225
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:12,500
Well, they tell me you haven't been
downtown for a whole week.

226
00:16:12,551 --> 00:16:13,599
No.

227
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:18,000
The doctor tells me I've got to retire.

228
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:20,700
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Sell out my business.

229
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:24,101
- Go away for a long rest.
- I'm very sorry indeed.

230
00:16:25,602 --> 00:16:29,202
Well, find someone to buy the business.

231
00:16:29,403 --> 00:16:31,103
Well, that's not so easy.

232
00:16:31,204 --> 00:16:33,204
Times are hard.

233
00:16:33,235 --> 00:16:37,600
I read about a man who retired and sold
his business to his employees.

234
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,801
That's a modern method.

235
00:16:39,802 --> 00:16:43,602
Our banks might finance a deal like that
if we were sold on the setup.

236
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:47,003
And you could keep your name on the
firm where it's been for 40 years.

237
00:16:47,284 --> 00:16:50,404
Well, who's the man to head it?

238
00:16:51,105 --> 00:16:54,405
Well, er... Spaulding, your Chicago man.

239
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:58,800
Yes, or Gault. He's done very well
with the timber and the mills.

240
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:01,400
Well, there's that new salesman Jim,
Mr. Duneen.

241
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:04,301
Oh, he's too young, too fresh.

242
00:17:05,902 --> 00:17:08,602
Young blood's not a bad idea
in an old business.

243
00:17:08,703 --> 00:17:10,303
Right you are.

244
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:14,600
Oh, well, suit yourself.

245
00:17:27,101 --> 00:17:29,001
If it's the lady, show her in.

246
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,670
You certainly were anxious.

247
00:17:36,691 --> 00:17:39,571
The great Duneen isn't dressed yet.
But come on in, honey.

248
00:17:44,072 --> 00:17:47,600
Well, well, well, if it isn't little old
Mary Linden herself.

249
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:49,500
I thought it was two other fellows
from Detroit.

250
00:17:49,551 --> 00:17:52,801
- Two other fellows named honey.
- Sure, the famous Honey twins.

251
00:17:52,842 --> 00:17:55,700
Make yourself at home.
Duneen'll grab himself a shirt.

252
00:17:55,721 --> 00:17:56,900
Okay.

253
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:22,900
Well, it's a pleasure, girlie,
it's a pleasure.

254
00:18:24,101 --> 00:18:26,600
- Like it?
- Yes, it's all right.

255
00:18:26,631 --> 00:18:28,001
How do you like my new apartment?

256
00:18:28,052 --> 00:18:30,000
I suppose it's much smarter
than your old one.

257
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:33,500
Sure! New contract, new salary,
new flat.

258
00:18:33,531 --> 00:18:36,800
Quite a progression, no?
I think it's pretty swell myself.

259
00:18:37,401 --> 00:18:39,200
Stunning.

260
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:44,000
Oh, I forgot. You're the prudish type,
who likes women old-fashioned.

261
00:18:44,701 --> 00:18:46,701
You're pretty regular at that.

262
00:18:46,742 --> 00:18:49,102
- I think you're swell.
- You don't know me.

263
00:18:49,203 --> 00:18:51,103
You only know my job.

264
00:18:51,204 --> 00:18:52,704
I smoke sometimes and...

265
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,700
wear an evening dress with
absolutely no back to it.

266
00:18:55,721 --> 00:18:56,721
No!

267
00:18:56,722 --> 00:19:01,400
And have been known to drink
a cocktail, that is, when urged.

268
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:04,700
I urge you! I beseech you!

269
00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:07,501
Well, rather than have my clothes
torn in a struggle, I will.

270
00:19:07,652 --> 00:19:09,802
That drink doesn't have orange
juice in it?

271
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:12,503
- I'm sorry, it has.
- No, thanks.

272
00:19:12,504 --> 00:19:15,400
Well, I'm glad to know you, Mrs. Ritz.

273
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:18,901
And the next time you come we'll have
that sauerkraut you crave.

274
00:19:20,002 --> 00:19:21,600
All kidding aside.

275
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:24,200
Why don't you and I get
together sometime, huh?

276
00:19:25,301 --> 00:19:27,401
Lets... sometime.

277
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,400
Well, knowing that you don't
love me for my body alone,

278
00:19:43,451 --> 00:19:46,400
I suppose you've come to make me
president of the company, huh?

279
00:19:47,001 --> 00:19:49,000
Well, maybe vice-president.

280
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:50,700
Mr. Ritter's got to retire.

281
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:53,250
He can't fire me.
I've got a contract.

282
00:19:53,271 --> 00:19:55,800
Ironclad, airtight and tied up
with pink string.

283
00:19:57,101 --> 00:19:59,680
Robinson of the City Trust could be
sold on the proposition...

284
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,800
to buy Ritter's stock for you
and pay for it out of the profits.

285
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,700
No, it isn't hashish.

286
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:17,501
Listen to me, Jim Duneen, I know
what I'm talking about.

287
00:20:17,652 --> 00:20:19,902
Robinson wants to keep the
firm in business.

288
00:20:19,923 --> 00:20:20,923
- I know...
- Oh, don't worry,

289
00:20:20,924 --> 00:20:22,800
he'd make something out of
the deal himself.

290
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:26,800
You have a fine record. Robinson's wide
open for young blood.

291
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:29,100
I'm not having any pipe dream...

292
00:20:29,131 --> 00:20:31,600
if you've got the stuff to sell
a proposition to Robinson.

293
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:33,800
I suppose you think I haven't, huh?

294
00:20:34,831 --> 00:20:36,600
What did you think I came here for?

295
00:20:37,401 --> 00:20:40,000
Find out if there's more than one
cough in a carload?

296
00:20:41,801 --> 00:20:43,501
Give me the low down.

297
00:20:53,202 --> 00:20:55,900
Now, here's the way I'd approach him.

298
00:20:57,101 --> 00:20:59,001
Mr. Robinson, you're a businessman.

299
00:20:59,102 --> 00:21:00,702
I'm a businessman.

300
00:21:00,703 --> 00:21:04,903
I feel sure that I can double the firm's
business in the next three years.

301
00:21:05,404 --> 00:21:09,404
Naturally, my efforts would be increased
if I were working for myself.

302
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:13,505
My plan guarantees... the continuance...

303
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:17,606
of the relations and profits
you have made with us.

304
00:21:18,707 --> 00:21:21,200
It is not only a bank's privilege
but its duty...

305
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:24,000
to foster the development of the
concerns with whom its past...

306
00:21:24,001 --> 00:21:26,101
present and future is allied.

307
00:21:26,802 --> 00:21:29,102
That's the speech that will get Robinson.

308
00:21:32,803 --> 00:21:34,803
Mr. Robinson...

309
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:36,900
you're a businessman...

310
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:38,801
I'm a businessman.

311
00:21:40,202 --> 00:21:44,942
I feel sure that I can double
the firm's business in the next...

312
00:21:44,973 --> 00:21:48,400
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
- Hey, what's the idea?

313
00:21:48,601 --> 00:21:52,300
Oh, here... blot it off.
I'll see if I can find you another one.

314
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:54,700
Fifteen bucks for that shirt, woman!

315
00:21:59,301 --> 00:22:01,500
That's a fine th...

316
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,101
Here, wear this one.

317
00:22:03,802 --> 00:22:05,802
Say, I aint going to a funeral!

318
00:22:05,803 --> 00:22:08,400
Wouldn't you think a spot of color'd
sort of brighten up the spirits...

319
00:22:08,431 --> 00:22:10,441
and show off the Duneen personality?

320
00:22:10,742 --> 00:22:13,142
Bankers are very conservative.

321
00:22:13,843 --> 00:22:15,743
Well, maybe you're right.

322
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,444
Well, I guess I'll be going now.

323
00:22:19,545 --> 00:22:22,700
Oh, I haven't thanked you yet.
You're just a swell kid.

324
00:22:22,851 --> 00:22:25,401
But then, I'm the only one that could
carry out the scheme.

325
00:22:26,002 --> 00:22:28,952
You'd better change your shirt.
Remember you've got to be there at 9:15.

326
00:22:28,983 --> 00:22:31,653
I'll be on time, don't worry.
And thanks again.

327
00:22:32,754 --> 00:22:35,654
Oh, uh... Mr. Robinson's address
is on this slip of paper.

328
00:22:35,685 --> 00:22:37,255
Leave it on the table.

329
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,856
I'll put my own number here too.

330
00:22:41,857 --> 00:22:44,100
Will you call me up as soon as you
leave Mr. Robinson's...

331
00:22:44,121 --> 00:22:45,480
and tell me how it came out?

332
00:22:45,499 --> 00:22:47,881
From the nearest drugstore, baby.

333
00:23:33,282 --> 00:23:34,800
Hello? Who is this?

334
00:23:34,851 --> 00:23:37,300
- Mr. Duneen.
- Mr. Duneen?

335
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:39,501
Oh, come right up.

336
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:57,502
Come on in, I'll be right out.

337
00:24:02,403 --> 00:24:04,700
I can hardly wait to hear
the good news.

338
00:24:14,501 --> 00:24:16,500
Oh, I thought it was someone else.

339
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:19,201
I intended you to.

340
00:24:20,202 --> 00:24:22,202
Why did you say you were Mr. Duneen?

341
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:24,100
What do you know about Mr. Duneen?

342
00:24:26,101 --> 00:24:29,301
Oh, he's the one that calls you Landy
when your name is Linden.

343
00:24:31,402 --> 00:24:33,400
How did you find out where I live?

344
00:24:34,301 --> 00:24:36,301
Oh, Dolores.

345
00:24:36,502 --> 00:24:38,880
If Muhammad won't come
to the mountain,

346
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:40,899
then the mountain must come
to Muhammad.

347
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,600
But this is the first time the mountain
had to wear a false beard.

348
00:24:44,881 --> 00:24:47,101
Do sit down.

349
00:24:48,102 --> 00:24:49,502
Oh, thanks.

350
00:24:52,503 --> 00:24:54,803
And I was just going to bed.

351
00:24:58,804 --> 00:25:01,600
For Mr. Wales she is just going to bed.

352
00:25:01,651 --> 00:25:04,801
For Mr. Duneen, oh, come right up,
come right up!

353
00:25:04,832 --> 00:25:07,002
I don't care to discuss Mr. Duneen.

354
00:25:09,503 --> 00:25:11,900
But I want to talk about Mr. Duneen.

355
00:25:13,401 --> 00:25:16,800
I want to talk about you
and I want to talk about me.

356
00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:21,101
Oh, I know all about you.

357
00:25:22,402 --> 00:25:27,102
Ronnie Wales, poor, white, honest.

358
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:29,040
Ambition?

359
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:30,400
Not to have to work for a living,

360
00:25:30,421 --> 00:25:33,550
so that I could go to the south
of France and write a book.

361
00:25:33,571 --> 00:25:36,251
And I don't believe in marriage.

362
00:25:39,852 --> 00:25:42,100
But I am married, you know that.

363
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:45,000
Well, we haven't lived together
for three years...

364
00:25:45,031 --> 00:25:46,999
As a matter of fact, I haven't
seen her for two.

365
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,900
Where's your cane and your tin mug...

366
00:25:49,901 --> 00:25:51,901
and a little dog to lead you?

367
00:25:51,942 --> 00:25:54,702
And how are lead pencils selling
these days?

368
00:25:58,103 --> 00:25:59,800
Hello? Yes?

369
00:26:00,201 --> 00:26:02,600
Hello, Mary.
I put it over.

370
00:26:02,631 --> 00:26:04,700
Knocked them for a loop.
And listen!

371
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:06,201
I'm to be vice-president.

372
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:10,100
Oh, I'm so glad for you, Mr. Duneen.

373
00:26:10,251 --> 00:26:13,500
The bank retains 20%.
The balance for me.

374
00:26:13,521 --> 00:26:15,200
And dividends credited on purchase.

375
00:26:15,221 --> 00:26:16,800
I'm gonna have ten years
to pay it off.

376
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:19,000
But I'll knock that for a row of ash cans.

377
00:26:19,501 --> 00:26:21,101
Hey, shut off that music!

378
00:26:21,102 --> 00:26:24,302
All right, darling, don't yell at me.

379
00:26:25,503 --> 00:26:27,703
Nice drugstore you're calling from.

380
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:31,104
Well I, uh... I'm home.

381
00:26:31,195 --> 00:26:32,805
Some people dropped in.

382
00:26:35,106 --> 00:26:37,800
Then don't let me keep you.
I'm entertaining myself.

383
00:26:38,401 --> 00:26:42,600
Go away, darling, how can I talk
business with you mauling me so?

384
00:26:45,101 --> 00:26:48,501
Oh, but darling, I can't keep
my hands off you.

385
00:26:51,002 --> 00:26:52,900
Excuse me!

386
00:26:52,941 --> 00:26:54,901
I'll see you at the office tomorrow.

387
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,200
Can I play some jazz now?

388
00:26:58,401 --> 00:27:00,400
No, I got business to attend to.

389
00:27:00,431 --> 00:27:02,301
Finish your drink and I'll call you a cab.

390
00:27:02,332 --> 00:27:04,102
All right.

391
00:27:55,203 --> 00:27:57,703
- Next time.
- Don't make me laugh.

392
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:01,204
- Good night, Mary.
- Good night.

393
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
- Good morning, Dolores.
- Good morning, Mr. Duneen.

394
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:55,201
- Good morning, Mary.
- Good morning.

395
00:28:55,502 --> 00:28:57,402
Bring your notebook.

396
00:29:09,103 --> 00:29:11,103
Take a cable to Ericsson.

397
00:29:14,104 --> 00:29:16,704
I have gone to great lengths...

398
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,805
to convince you...

399
00:29:19,006 --> 00:29:23,206
that it would be unwise to open
an agency in this country.

400
00:29:24,807 --> 00:29:27,507
The usual signature.
How does that sound?

401
00:29:29,108 --> 00:29:31,280
Why don't you say something
about our overhead being...

402
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:33,381
so distributed that it cuts
down costs?

403
00:29:33,682 --> 00:29:35,700
Oh... yeah, put that in.

404
00:29:35,721 --> 00:29:36,999
Make it short, you know.

405
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,900
Anything else?

406
00:29:42,101 --> 00:29:43,801
Uh, let me see.

407
00:29:46,602 --> 00:29:48,100
Excuse me.

408
00:29:48,801 --> 00:29:52,150
Went to a party at Mr. Robinson's
last night. Late.

409
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:55,300
Uh, by the way, his daughter's name
is Helen, isn't it?

410
00:29:56,401 --> 00:29:57,901
Ellen, I believe.

411
00:29:57,992 --> 00:29:59,202
Oh.

412
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:08,103
Don't you think we ought to make one
more try for Rainmaker's business?

413
00:30:09,004 --> 00:30:11,050
I closed it last time
at Mr. Robinson's house.

414
00:30:11,071 --> 00:30:13,051
For five years, at 2.39.

415
00:30:13,072 --> 00:30:16,352
- Oh, Jim, that's splendid.
- Not bad, what?

416
00:30:16,373 --> 00:30:18,680
It's more than splendid, it's the biggest
thing you've done.

417
00:30:18,699 --> 00:30:20,481
I'm proud of you.

418
00:30:20,582 --> 00:30:21,882
Hm... yeah.

419
00:30:22,883 --> 00:30:25,583
I'd be proud of myself if I didn't
have this awful head.

420
00:30:31,984 --> 00:30:34,984
It took a lot of champagne
to warm up old Rainmaker.

421
00:30:36,685 --> 00:30:40,385
As my old man used to say,
a hair from the dog that bit you.

422
00:30:41,386 --> 00:30:42,686
Gee...

423
00:30:42,687 --> 00:30:45,187
What a tough time my folks had.

424
00:30:47,588 --> 00:30:50,188
I wish I had my luck while
they were still living.

425
00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:53,489
Were you very poor when
you were a kid?

426
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,850
The greatest tragedy of my life
was graduating from highschool...

427
00:30:56,871 --> 00:30:59,151
with a patch on the seat
of my trousers

428
00:30:59,552 --> 00:31:02,252
And all the other squirts in tuxedos.

429
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:05,000
You've done remarkably.

430
00:31:05,101 --> 00:31:07,401
From a handicapped start.

431
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:09,702
Thanks, Mary.

432
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:12,203
That's nice of you to say that.

433
00:31:20,104 --> 00:31:21,374
Yes?

434
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:23,150
Just a minute.

435
00:31:23,171 --> 00:31:26,051
It's a Miss Daisy Presby, says she
has an appointment.

436
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:28,442
Shall I get rid of her?

437
00:31:30,143 --> 00:31:31,843
Uh, no...

438
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:33,700
No, wait a minute.

439
00:31:33,701 --> 00:31:35,301
Have Miss Presby wait.

440
00:31:37,302 --> 00:31:40,202
I've, uh... I've hired an
assistant for you.

441
00:31:40,203 --> 00:31:42,000
You've been working too many nights.

442
00:31:42,301 --> 00:31:44,601
This girl can take some
of the dictation.

443
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,602
But I haven't complained.

444
00:31:48,703 --> 00:31:51,500
I don't want you to wear
yourself out, you know.

445
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,501
I thought it was my job to engage
the new girls.

446
00:31:55,902 --> 00:31:58,202
This is, uh, this is different.

447
00:31:59,003 --> 00:32:00,300
I see.

448
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:03,801
Jim, I'd rather not have
an assistant.

449
00:32:03,902 --> 00:32:06,702
I can attend to everything.
I'm not a bit overworked.

450
00:32:06,793 --> 00:32:09,603
I know, but I've hired the girl.
She's to start in the morning.

451
00:32:10,404 --> 00:32:13,804
I'm afraid I must decide on the
adviseability of these things.

452
00:32:16,105 --> 00:32:17,500
Very well.

453
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:22,000
Well, what else?

454
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:24,651
By the way, uh,

455
00:32:24,672 --> 00:32:28,250
I was right about tails and white tie
for the Robinsons' dinner, wasn't I?

456
00:32:28,891 --> 00:32:32,400
If there's one thing I flatter myself on,
it's knowing how to dress.

457
00:32:32,801 --> 00:32:34,201
Of course.

458
00:32:35,902 --> 00:32:39,999
I can't understand why this florist bill
should be $100 higher than last month's.

459
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,000
We haven't ordered more than usual.

460
00:32:43,801 --> 00:32:45,301
I'll check it over.

461
00:32:45,402 --> 00:32:49,802
By the way, send a dozen American
Beauty roses do Miss Ellen Robinson.

462
00:32:53,603 --> 00:32:55,103
Very well.

463
00:33:02,604 --> 00:33:05,804
Oh, by the way, how much does
Miss Daisy Presby go in the payroll for?

464
00:33:07,405 --> 00:33:09,405
Uh, put her down for fifty a week.

465
00:33:10,706 --> 00:33:12,706
And see that no one disturbs me.

466
00:33:22,507 --> 00:33:24,557
This is James Duneen's secretary
speaking.

467
00:33:24,578 --> 00:33:28,858
I want you to send two dozen of your
nicest roses to Miss Ellen Robinson.

468
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:31,600
Yes. Hold the phone a moment,
I'll give you her address.

469
00:33:31,701 --> 00:33:36,000
What?
Oh, you have her address.

470
00:33:37,201 --> 00:33:39,300
Yes, it's the same Miss Robinson.

471
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,000
All right, thank you.

472
00:33:45,801 --> 00:33:47,301
Miss Presby?

473
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:49,102
Hm-hmm.

474
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,700
Fill out this card, please.
You'll start in the morning.

475
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:54,801
You'll have the small desk
over there.

476
00:34:09,702 --> 00:34:12,200
Oh, darn these chairs!

477
00:34:15,001 --> 00:34:16,801
There goes my stocking.

478
00:34:18,502 --> 00:34:20,702
Six bucks a pair.

479
00:34:24,203 --> 00:34:27,700
Oh, I picked up a swell combination
at Wimball's,

480
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:30,200
I'm saving it for my hope chest.

481
00:34:32,801 --> 00:34:34,001
Look.

482
00:34:36,702 --> 00:34:38,442
I ask you.

483
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:41,843
Isn't that the sin you love to touch?

484
00:34:42,244 --> 00:34:43,844
Lovely.

485
00:34:49,645 --> 00:34:52,200
But they robbed you.
I got the same thing for fourteen.

486
00:34:52,451 --> 00:34:57,401
Oh, don't tell me you wear French
lingerie beneath that flower sack.

487
00:34:58,702 --> 00:35:01,042
What I wear next to my lily-white body...

488
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,500
is, strange as it may seem,
nobody's business.

489
00:35:07,001 --> 00:35:10,901
Soft goes Dempsey and, shock,
he takes it on the chin.

490
00:35:12,602 --> 00:35:16,300
Well, I think I'll just pop in
and say hello to Jim.

491
00:35:16,321 --> 00:35:18,351
Just a minute.
He doesn't wish to be disturbed.

492
00:35:18,372 --> 00:35:20,332
You can't go in when the red
light's burning.

493
00:35:20,353 --> 00:35:25,233
Listen, sugar, I go past all red lights
without even slowing down.

494
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:44,334
- How do you do, Prentiss?
- Miss Linden.

495
00:35:44,355 --> 00:35:46,835
- Is Mr. Duneen ready for me?
- Expecting you.

496
00:35:46,856 --> 00:35:47,999
Oh, by the way,

497
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,550
hereafter I don't want Mr. Duneen bothered
with any of the household details.

498
00:35:50,571 --> 00:35:52,671
- I'll do the buying myself.
- Yes, Miss Linden.

499
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,042
Fresh flowers in there, please, Prentiss.

500
00:35:54,043 --> 00:35:55,653
Yes, Miss Linden.

501
00:35:57,554 --> 00:36:00,354
- Good morning, Martin.
- Good morning, Miss Linden.

502
00:36:00,855 --> 00:36:02,455
Come.

503
00:36:03,256 --> 00:36:04,656
Good morning.

504
00:36:05,257 --> 00:36:06,800
Good morning.

505
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,401
How do you feel?

506
00:36:09,552 --> 00:36:11,000
Terrible.

507
00:36:11,241 --> 00:36:14,500
And that Cliden business has got
to be settled today.

508
00:36:16,101 --> 00:36:18,201
I got another inside tip.

509
00:36:18,202 --> 00:36:20,602
- Here's the mail for you.
- Oh...

510
00:36:24,603 --> 00:36:28,003
- Anything else, Mr. Duneen?
- That's all, thanks, Martin.

511
00:36:30,904 --> 00:36:33,400
I know that a price of 2.32
was discussed.

512
00:36:33,431 --> 00:36:35,301
If we get the order, Mary...

513
00:36:35,302 --> 00:36:38,402
you'll get a swell new fitted bag.

514
00:36:39,203 --> 00:36:41,500
I'd rather have a raise.

515
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,601
You're jealous because Miss Presby
got one?

516
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,900
Hardly. It's not the same situation.

517
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,300
You're different.

518
00:36:51,351 --> 00:36:53,001
For your sorrow?

519
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,500
She's just a diversion.

520
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,900
She got her salary raised.

521
00:36:57,961 --> 00:36:59,999
I'll say she's diverting.

522
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,700
You hate her, don't you?

523
00:37:02,901 --> 00:37:06,000
Certainly not. But she ruins
the morale of the office.

524
00:37:06,051 --> 00:37:09,601
And from the things she says you'd think
she was one of the board of directors.

525
00:37:09,642 --> 00:37:12,702
You'll get a swell fitted bag
nevertheless.

526
00:37:34,703 --> 00:37:36,703
You look tired, Mary.

527
00:37:36,999 --> 00:37:39,304
Why don't you take a day off?

528
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
As a matter of fact, I have an invitation
to spend the weekend at Atlantic City.

529
00:37:47,201 --> 00:37:50,200
Fine, take the weekend off.

530
00:37:51,801 --> 00:37:54,400
You think Daisy can do my work too?

531
00:37:55,401 --> 00:37:58,001
She's a little inexperienced, but...

532
00:37:58,062 --> 00:38:00,002
yeah, I think she can.

533
00:38:04,703 --> 00:38:06,600
I don't think so.

534
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:09,201
I can postpone my Atlantic City trip.

535
00:38:09,402 --> 00:38:11,602
It's a standing invitation.

536
00:38:12,203 --> 00:38:13,803
Hope you feel better.

537
00:38:13,904 --> 00:38:15,604
Thanks, Mary.

538
00:38:23,205 --> 00:38:24,335
Boo!

539
00:38:26,436 --> 00:38:29,000
Don't do that.

540
00:38:29,201 --> 00:38:32,000
I thought the Black Killer of Basehorder
had got me.

541
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:35,500
- Theater, eh?
- Started with the theater.

542
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:39,700
- Ended up by driving on the Post Road.
- Oh, sounds romantic.

543
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:42,701
- Who is he?
- Jim Duneen.

544
00:38:43,502 --> 00:38:46,900
- How long has this been going on?
- It hasn't gone on.

545
00:38:46,941 --> 00:38:49,400
I've been out with him
once or twice.

546
00:38:49,401 --> 00:38:52,200
- And he sends me flowers.
- Well,

547
00:38:52,201 --> 00:38:54,000
You've a lot in common.

548
00:38:54,301 --> 00:38:57,000
His neckties, for instance.

549
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,500
That's not fair. He's improved
unbelievably.

550
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:04,000
- He's a very remarkable young man.
- Oh!

551
00:39:04,501 --> 00:39:06,800
Like him pretty much?

552
00:39:07,901 --> 00:39:09,301
Pretty much.

553
00:39:10,302 --> 00:39:12,500
Then in the morning you'll
see a doctor.

554
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:15,300
Oh, don't be silly!
I'm all right.

555
00:39:15,331 --> 00:39:16,680
No, you're not.

556
00:39:16,699 --> 00:39:22,000
No girl's healthy who prefers a good,
sound businessman to a dancing fool.

557
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:26,450
But when I really start fiddling,
even Jim Duneen will dance.

558
00:39:26,481 --> 00:39:31,200
Now don't you look forward to an existence
of all afternoon at the horse show...

559
00:39:31,231 --> 00:39:33,601
and all evening at contract with him.

560
00:39:34,102 --> 00:39:37,002
- He's not the type.
- No?

561
00:39:37,103 --> 00:39:40,700
- Just wait till I get him in my clutches.
- Oh.

562
00:39:47,001 --> 00:39:49,999
I'm afraid there's another
woman in his life.

563
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,000
What?

564
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:55,301
Lip rouge on his handkerchief.

565
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,702
They never learn, do they?

566
00:40:11,403 --> 00:40:13,200
Positively no nonsense.

567
00:40:13,351 --> 00:40:17,000
Unless a contract is lived up to,
it is not a contract.

568
00:40:17,901 --> 00:40:20,701
There is no reason why we cannot
cooperate...

569
00:40:20,902 --> 00:40:24,202
on an issue involving so much
of our mutual welfare.

570
00:40:25,503 --> 00:40:27,003
Yours truly.

571
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,204
Well, what's the matter?

572
00:40:33,005 --> 00:40:35,205
The letter's too strong, Jim.

573
00:40:35,206 --> 00:40:37,206
You've got to be tough with Bueller.

574
00:40:37,207 --> 00:40:39,107
Write it as I dictated it.

575
00:40:39,308 --> 00:40:40,908
Very well.

576
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:44,309
Well, now what have you got for me?

577
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,210
Oh, Martin says you need shirts.
Any particular choice of color?

578
00:40:53,111 --> 00:40:55,611
Do I ever wear anything
but white shirts?

579
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,312
Who do you think I am,
a shipping clerk?

580
00:41:01,313 --> 00:41:03,000
I beg your pardon.

581
00:41:06,401 --> 00:41:08,000
Oh, Mary, uh...

582
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:10,402
Martin ordered sort of an
evening tie for me last night.

583
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:12,603
Narrow, very smart.

584
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:15,204
Tell him to order a dozen more.

585
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,900
I bought it for you.

586
00:41:25,301 --> 00:41:29,000
Oh, and Mary, uh...
Chase another Bueller.

587
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:30,601
Tone it down.

588
00:41:30,602 --> 00:41:33,702
That part about positively no nonsense.

589
00:41:33,733 --> 00:41:36,303
Leave that out entirely.

590
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,300
And Mary...

591
00:41:46,301 --> 00:41:49,900
I don't want Miss Presby to take
any more of my dictation.

592
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:54,501
What's the matter? Is she beginning
to get breach of promising?

593
00:42:06,202 --> 00:42:07,552
Yeah?

594
00:42:07,573 --> 00:42:10,200
- The Burden brothers are here.
- The Burden brothers?

595
00:42:10,801 --> 00:42:13,600
Oh, I have to take them out tonight
and make whoopee with them.

596
00:42:13,641 --> 00:42:15,100
Do you want to come along?

597
00:42:15,251 --> 00:42:19,200
Do you think it's decent of me to take
the place of the dear departed so soon?

598
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:21,101
Huh?

599
00:42:21,192 --> 00:42:23,602
Are you sure you wouldn't rather
have Miss Presby?

600
00:42:23,753 --> 00:42:26,203
I asked you, didn't I?

601
00:42:26,204 --> 00:42:29,604
I'd love to go.
Shall I show the Burdens in?

602
00:42:30,205 --> 00:42:31,805
Yeah, show 'em in.

603
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,600
And then Father lost money.

604
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:53,700
Of course the managers were very glad to
have a society girl to go on the stage.

605
00:42:53,731 --> 00:42:59,501
But sometimes I feel it's very degrading
for a girl from an old Virginia family.

606
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,302
And you had to give up that big,
white, colonial mansion.

607
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:08,223
Oh no, Mama lives there.

608
00:43:08,244 --> 00:43:11,124
I send her part of my salary
every week.

609
00:43:11,195 --> 00:43:15,500
Of course that doesn't leave me
very much for myself.

610
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:18,000
There, there, Sybil.

611
00:43:18,001 --> 00:43:22,100
Oh, Mr. Burden, but I only just
met you tonight.

612
00:43:22,101 --> 00:43:25,800
Oh well, let's have another drink
and then you'll know me better.

613
00:43:25,801 --> 00:43:29,800
This little girl Sybil has had
a heap of trouble, Jim.

614
00:43:30,401 --> 00:43:33,201
I think she needs something
to brace her up.

615
00:43:33,232 --> 00:43:35,700
Trouble? Trouble?

616
00:43:35,731 --> 00:43:37,701
Oh, I remember that word.

617
00:43:37,732 --> 00:43:40,800
That's what poor people have
when their rent's due.

618
00:43:41,701 --> 00:43:43,101
That's a good joke.

619
00:43:43,142 --> 00:43:48,702
Trouble's only something poor people
have when the rent's due.

620
00:43:48,843 --> 00:43:51,500
Oh, Mr. Burden.

621
00:43:51,501 --> 00:43:54,800
are you really going to pay my rent?

622
00:43:58,701 --> 00:44:01,500
Oh, Mr. Duneen, who's going
to pay my rent?

623
00:44:01,501 --> 00:44:04,500
What did you do?
Blow the rent on that frock?

624
00:44:04,531 --> 00:44:07,301
- What's the matter with this frock?
- Absolutely nothing.

625
00:44:07,302 --> 00:44:10,100
Looks as if you'd been poured in it
and forgot to say when.

626
00:44:10,151 --> 00:44:13,101
I suppose you'd like me to wear this
around the paper and pulp business.

627
00:44:13,132 --> 00:44:15,300
Well, you don't have to dress
the way you do.

628
00:44:15,321 --> 00:44:17,951
- The other girls don't.
- Oh, you notice that, do you?

629
00:44:17,972 --> 00:44:21,300
They make us notice it.
But they can't all crave me.

630
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:24,400
No, but they can all crave
raises in salaries.

631
00:44:24,901 --> 00:44:28,000
- How much do you get?
- Seventy.

632
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,801
You should have more.

633
00:44:32,832 --> 00:44:34,502
That's sweet.

634
00:44:36,803 --> 00:44:39,853
- Do you dance?
- Even better than I take dictation.

635
00:44:39,884 --> 00:44:41,654
Let's go!

636
00:45:11,755 --> 00:45:14,500
I never knew you had a place
like this, Mary.

637
00:45:14,501 --> 00:45:18,100
- Won't you come in a minute?
- I'd love to.

638
00:45:25,401 --> 00:45:27,000
- Come here.
- Oh...

639
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,900
- Sit down, won't you?
- Thanks.

640
00:45:40,901 --> 00:45:45,201
You know, it's funny, I never figured
out what your private life must be.

641
00:45:45,402 --> 00:45:49,402
I just thought of you as a perfect
machine in an office.

642
00:45:50,403 --> 00:45:52,403
I gathered that.

643
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:55,404
Mary.

644
00:46:11,105 --> 00:46:12,400
You know, Mary,

645
00:46:12,401 --> 00:46:16,101
I'm very happy that you and I
got together tonight the way we did.

646
00:46:16,152 --> 00:46:17,202
Are you?

647
00:46:17,903 --> 00:46:20,100
I'm terribly fond of you.

648
00:46:20,601 --> 00:46:22,200
Well, how could I help it?

649
00:46:22,301 --> 00:46:25,201
Eight, ten, twelve hours
a day together.

650
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:27,802
Mostly behind closed doors.

651
00:46:29,603 --> 00:46:33,903
Proving that a working girl can be safe
from the advances of her employer.

652
00:46:33,954 --> 00:46:38,354
Well, I always figured that business
and pleasure don't mix.

653
00:46:38,855 --> 00:46:40,655
That's not it.

654
00:46:40,696 --> 00:46:43,256
You've looked at me a thousand times...

655
00:46:43,757 --> 00:46:46,157
and never saw me until tonight.

656
00:46:46,758 --> 00:46:48,758
I see you now.

657
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:54,059
And you look pretty good to me.

658
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,460
I wonder if it isn't the dress.

659
00:46:59,261 --> 00:47:00,999
Or perhaps the liquor.

660
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,300
Have another drink?

661
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,380
Oh, would you have liked it
if I'd kissed you in the office...

662
00:47:07,399 --> 00:47:09,600
when you first came to work for me?

663
00:47:09,751 --> 00:47:12,400
A kiss depends upon who's doing it...

664
00:47:12,421 --> 00:47:13,901
and how it's done.

665
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:18,402
How's this?

666
00:47:32,603 --> 00:47:34,503
You don't need that drink.

667
00:47:40,504 --> 00:47:42,704
I know all you've done for me.

668
00:47:43,105 --> 00:47:46,205
I wouldn't be where I am today
if it weren't for you.

669
00:47:47,006 --> 00:47:50,306
I've been blinded by my own success.

670
00:47:51,207 --> 00:47:54,007
But from now on things are going
to be different.

671
00:48:08,208 --> 00:48:09,800
It's late...

672
00:48:10,501 --> 00:48:12,701
Jimmy, I've got to be a machine again.

673
00:48:15,302 --> 00:48:17,202
It's past three o'clock.

674
00:48:17,203 --> 00:48:20,203
One of us has to be on hand at ten
in the morning. Wyler will be there.

675
00:48:22,204 --> 00:48:24,104
Hang Wyler.

676
00:48:24,605 --> 00:48:28,125
Hang all the pulp and paper
in the world.

677
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,226
Jimmy.

678
00:48:34,727 --> 00:48:36,000
Jimmy...

679
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,201
All right.

680
00:48:40,702 --> 00:48:42,802
Give me a drink and I'll run along.

681
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,503
You're drinking a lot lately.

682
00:48:46,004 --> 00:48:49,104
- It's foolish.
- Let me be foolish tonight.

683
00:48:49,505 --> 00:48:51,700
It's a night of nights, isn't it?

684
00:49:11,901 --> 00:49:15,101
- Pour it?
- Uh... straight.

685
00:49:17,702 --> 00:49:19,000
Thanks, dear.

686
00:49:22,701 --> 00:49:24,301
Well, here's how.

687
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,502
Good night, Mary.

688
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:50,263
Good night, Jim.

689
00:50:41,264 --> 00:50:43,464
- Yes?
- Bring your notebook.

690
00:50:43,485 --> 00:50:44,600
All right.

691
00:51:05,301 --> 00:51:06,700
Good morning, Jim.

692
00:51:06,851 --> 00:51:08,400
Oh, good morning.

693
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:11,900
Take a letter to Berman.

694
00:51:16,701 --> 00:51:18,201
Dear Jake,

695
00:51:20,102 --> 00:51:22,300
I cannot understand...

696
00:51:22,341 --> 00:51:25,200
the change in your attitude.

697
00:51:28,801 --> 00:51:31,701
I guess I had a little too much
to drink last night, didn't I?

698
00:51:31,902 --> 00:51:33,302
Did you?

699
00:51:33,343 --> 00:51:35,000
Didn't you notice it?

700
00:51:35,011 --> 00:51:37,401
- No.
- That's good.

701
00:51:37,402 --> 00:51:40,600
I was afraid I might have...
Well, I mean...

702
00:51:40,621 --> 00:51:43,701
Did I get fresh, or make a pass at you,
or anything like that?

703
00:51:44,732 --> 00:51:46,202
Why, no.

704
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,350
That's a relief.
You know, Mary,

705
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:51,700
I don't remember a darn thing that happened
after about ten o'clock last night.

706
00:52:06,821 --> 00:52:09,800
I cannot understand the change
in your attitude.

707
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,201
Huh?

708
00:52:14,002 --> 00:52:15,702
You were dictating.

709
00:52:16,203 --> 00:52:18,000
Oh, yes, yes...

710
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:23,300
I cannot understand the change
in your attitude.

711
00:52:23,451 --> 00:52:27,101
I cannot understand the change
in your attitude...

712
00:52:27,302 --> 00:52:29,902
As the weeks roll by...

713
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,800
- Good evening, Miss Linden.
- Good evening, Prentiss.

714
00:53:00,201 --> 00:53:03,300
- Did the flowers come?
- Ready and waiting, miss.

715
00:53:06,301 --> 00:53:07,700
Oh, there they are.

716
00:53:10,501 --> 00:53:12,201
Aren't they lovely.

717
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,602
I'll start with these, Prentiss.

718
00:53:14,633 --> 00:53:16,400
- With those?
- Yes.

719
00:53:21,301 --> 00:53:23,400
Were the monthly bills all right?

720
00:53:23,421 --> 00:53:26,500
Yes, they were nicely checked
and everything's under control.

721
00:53:27,001 --> 00:53:30,301
- Is Mr. Duneen home?
- Not since this morning.

722
00:53:30,802 --> 00:53:32,802
He hasn't been at the office
all day either.

723
00:53:32,843 --> 00:53:35,403
Well, that's understandable.

724
00:53:39,204 --> 00:53:42,180
I hope you don't mind my stepping into
your province fixing these flowers.

725
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:43,981
Not at all, Miss Linden.

726
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,682
Who's the party for?

727
00:54:01,783 --> 00:54:04,000
Prentiss, I asked who's the party for.

728
00:54:04,501 --> 00:54:08,101
I thought perhaps you'd like
to arrange these also.

729
00:54:08,502 --> 00:54:09,902
Why, what's there?

730
00:54:57,603 --> 00:54:59,603
You finish the flowers, Prentiss.

731
00:54:59,704 --> 00:55:01,204
Yes, Miss Linden.

732
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:44,000
Hello, Mary.

733
00:55:44,001 --> 00:55:47,700
That lunk Freddie stood me up
so I came over here.

734
00:55:49,001 --> 00:55:51,601
These men are swine, though.

735
00:55:55,702 --> 00:55:57,402
What's the matter?

736
00:56:11,703 --> 00:56:13,900
What are you crying for?

737
00:56:17,801 --> 00:56:20,900
Society girl wins big paper man.

738
00:56:22,501 --> 00:56:23,701
What?

739
00:56:25,602 --> 00:56:28,200
Robinson hooked Jim.

740
00:56:28,221 --> 00:56:30,500
Well, cut my throat.

741
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,701
Wait a minute.

742
00:56:52,402 --> 00:56:54,600
Here, Mary, take a drink of this.

743
00:57:06,301 --> 00:57:08,100
Time for the speeches.

744
00:57:08,401 --> 00:57:12,501
A toast to the bride.
Long may she wave.

745
00:57:31,702 --> 00:57:34,202
Gee, I'd try to help you, Mary, but...

746
00:57:34,293 --> 00:57:37,103
I guess it's better to get it
out of your system.

747
00:57:44,704 --> 00:57:47,380
If it hadn't been for me.

748
00:57:47,399 --> 00:57:49,000
I know.

749
00:57:49,201 --> 00:57:50,401
I know.

750
00:57:50,902 --> 00:57:54,000
Oh, don't let anybody in.
I don't care who it is.

751
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,103
Hello...

752
00:58:35,134 --> 00:58:37,104
- What's the matter, Mary?
- Oh, nothing.

753
00:58:37,135 --> 00:58:39,300
Come on, now, tell Ronnie everything.

754
00:58:44,401 --> 00:58:45,701
All right.

755
00:58:47,202 --> 00:58:48,602
I'll tell you.

756
00:58:49,303 --> 00:58:51,500
I haven't got any pride left.

757
00:58:53,601 --> 00:58:56,100
The engagement is announced.

758
00:58:56,901 --> 00:59:01,100
of Miss Ellen Robinson to Mr. James Duneen.

759
00:59:03,601 --> 00:59:05,700
I'm thoroughly licked, Ronnie.

760
00:59:09,401 --> 00:59:11,800
I made him look like a gentleman.

761
00:59:11,871 --> 00:59:14,101
I've taught him to speak
the king's English.

762
00:59:15,902 --> 00:59:18,802
I've shared his troubles and worries.

763
00:59:19,603 --> 00:59:22,303
I've lifted him above the Presbys.

764
00:59:23,104 --> 00:59:26,604
I've stood between him and a dozen
cheap designing women.

765
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,505
But when it comes to a girl with beauty,

766
00:59:33,206 --> 00:59:37,600
and money, and a glamorous position,

767
00:59:39,301 --> 00:59:41,401
I can't do a thing.

768
00:59:43,602 --> 00:59:47,900
A girl of his own class.
The class I gave him.

769
00:59:47,943 --> 00:59:50,500
Now, now, Mary, take it easy.
It isn't that bad.

770
00:59:50,601 --> 00:59:53,101
Take it easy, come on,
come on.

771
00:59:53,202 --> 00:59:56,300
Oh, all right, let's have a drink.

772
00:59:57,501 --> 01:00:00,300
Please don't, Mary.
That isn't going to help you.

773
01:00:07,301 --> 01:00:10,800
Well, Ronnie, the next time...

774
01:00:11,799 --> 01:00:13,601
The next time...

775
01:00:13,999 --> 01:00:16,000
Do you get me?

776
01:00:21,601 --> 01:00:23,301
We won't talk about that now.

777
01:00:24,102 --> 01:00:26,802
Oh, so you're going to spurn
me too, are you?

778
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,603
After a while, we'll talk about that.

779
01:00:42,704 --> 01:00:43,704
Yes?

780
01:00:44,805 --> 01:00:46,705
Oh, send her in.

781
01:00:52,406 --> 01:00:54,600
Miss Ellen Robinson to see you.

782
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,401
Yes, I will.

783
01:01:06,602 --> 01:01:08,332
I'm Ellen Robinson.

784
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:09,800
Yes, I know.

785
01:01:09,801 --> 01:01:13,201
- You came to see Mr. Duneen?
- No. You.

786
01:01:13,402 --> 01:01:14,552
Oh.

787
01:01:14,593 --> 01:01:15,900
Won't you sit down.

788
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:21,500
Thank you.

789
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,600
Miss Linden,

790
01:01:24,631 --> 01:01:27,500
when I first decided I wanted
to marry Jim Duneen...

791
01:01:27,531 --> 01:01:30,000
My father and I naturally
talked it over.

792
01:01:30,201 --> 01:01:32,501
I'm sure your father approved.

793
01:01:32,502 --> 01:01:35,500
My father has known you
for a long time.

794
01:01:35,601 --> 01:01:37,401
Only in a business way.

795
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:41,102
So that's how I happened to know
you're in love with Jim Duneen.

796
01:01:42,903 --> 01:01:44,703
That's not true!

797
01:01:45,204 --> 01:01:47,404
That proves it.

798
01:01:49,905 --> 01:01:53,650
Could I work alongside of Jim Duneen for
years without falling in love with him?

799
01:01:53,671 --> 01:01:55,000
Certainly not.

800
01:01:55,701 --> 01:01:57,401
Get to the point.

801
01:01:57,432 --> 01:01:59,100
Your admission that you're
in love with him,

802
01:01:59,121 --> 01:02:02,000
hardly qualifies you, from
a fiancée's viewpoint,

803
01:02:02,021 --> 01:02:03,701
for further employment.

804
01:02:05,002 --> 01:02:06,900
You want me to quit?

805
01:02:07,501 --> 01:02:10,301
- At once.
- And if I refuse?

806
01:02:10,322 --> 01:02:12,902
I shall tell him you're desperately
in love with him...

807
01:02:12,943 --> 01:02:16,103
and that it would be charitable
to ask you to leave.

808
01:02:16,804 --> 01:02:19,004
You wouldn't do that.

809
01:02:19,095 --> 01:02:21,700
Oh, wouldn't I?

810
01:02:34,901 --> 01:02:37,001
When Greek meets Greek!

811
01:02:38,502 --> 01:02:41,002
What do you mean calling
me a Greek?

812
01:02:48,403 --> 01:02:50,303
Pardon my intrusion.

813
01:02:51,504 --> 01:02:53,000
Well, what do you want?

814
01:02:55,301 --> 01:02:58,100
Mr. Duneen, I think I've been
here long enough.

815
01:02:58,131 --> 01:03:00,201
Why, Mary, what are you
talking about?

816
01:03:00,222 --> 01:03:03,350
I've got a better job. Shorter hours,
more money.

817
01:03:03,371 --> 01:03:05,100
Now, Mary, don't do anything foolish.

818
01:03:05,121 --> 01:03:07,600
- We'll talk this over later.
- There's nothing to talk over.

819
01:03:07,631 --> 01:03:09,700
I've had it in mind for some time.

820
01:03:10,001 --> 01:03:12,100
It was just settled today.

821
01:03:12,801 --> 01:03:14,300
I'm leaving immediately.

822
01:03:14,331 --> 01:03:16,201
It won't inconvenience you any.

823
01:03:16,302 --> 01:03:19,402
Remember you still have Daisy.
Goodbye.

824
01:03:19,903 --> 01:03:21,003
Mary!

825
01:03:21,104 --> 01:03:22,304
Jim!

826
01:03:37,505 --> 01:03:39,455
What are you doing?
Gonna quit?

827
01:03:39,456 --> 01:03:41,400
Get out of here!
I want to be alone.

828
01:03:53,001 --> 01:03:55,201
What's this Presby tells me?
You've quit?

829
01:03:57,002 --> 01:03:59,202
You know what I've done for
Jim Duneen, don't you?

830
01:03:59,223 --> 01:04:01,250
- Sure, but Mary...
- You know that because I've loved him...

831
01:04:01,271 --> 01:04:03,000
I've played straight as a string.

832
01:04:03,021 --> 01:04:04,600
But you've know for some
time that he...

833
01:04:04,621 --> 01:04:08,800
You know that I've met a dozen men.
Nice men, that wanted me.

834
01:04:09,101 --> 01:04:10,780
And what did I tell them?

835
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:14,600
Like a fool, I'd say, no, no, no,
you can't have Mary Linden.

836
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:17,901
She's a good girl.
And what did I say to myself?

837
01:04:17,922 --> 01:04:22,200
Like a fool, I said, Mary, you just
keep yourself a nice, fine little girl...

838
01:04:22,231 --> 01:04:26,051
and one of these days Jim Duneen will
realize how good and worthy you are.

839
01:04:26,092 --> 01:04:27,500
Baloney!

840
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:29,801
But I thought that was all over.
Last night Ronnie told me...

841
01:04:29,802 --> 01:04:31,952
Yes, there's Ronnie.
And I like Ronnie.

842
01:04:31,973 --> 01:04:33,953
And we've had a lot of good
times together.

843
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:37,754
But when Ronnie offered me everything
in the world a girl could wish for,

844
01:04:37,755 --> 01:04:40,200
what do I do?
I turn him down!

845
01:04:40,231 --> 01:04:43,701
Like the nice, fat-headed, virtuous
little moron that I am.

846
01:04:43,722 --> 01:04:45,980
Well, that's all over, my fine girl.

847
01:04:45,999 --> 01:04:47,800
Mary, quiet! Somebody will hear you.

848
01:04:47,821 --> 01:04:49,400
Let them hear me!

849
01:04:49,401 --> 01:04:52,801
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to Atlantic City!

850
01:05:34,102 --> 01:05:35,402
I'll see you later.

851
01:08:21,503 --> 01:08:23,303
I can't make the grade, Ronnie.

852
01:08:26,204 --> 01:08:29,000
Aren't you just asking for a lot
of trouble and unhappiness?

853
01:08:29,011 --> 01:08:31,401
Can't you put him out of your mind?

854
01:08:32,802 --> 01:08:35,502
He's out of my life.
I'm reconciled with that.

855
01:08:37,803 --> 01:08:41,200
But see this.
A price tag off my nightgown.

856
01:08:42,801 --> 01:08:45,801
I found one of these on the floor
of Jim's bedroom once.

857
01:08:46,902 --> 01:08:50,402
I knew the girl and I despised her
for being cheap and trivial.

858
01:08:52,303 --> 01:08:54,703
I just don't want to be
that cheap myself.

859
01:08:58,004 --> 01:08:59,999
The funny part about it is...

860
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,730
that I am priced at exactly $8 less...

861
01:09:02,751 --> 01:09:05,999
than one of the most obvious
young women I have ever met.

862
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,500
Mary, dear,

863
01:09:13,741 --> 01:09:16,601
if my wife didn't have all the
money in the family,

864
01:09:17,302 --> 01:09:20,100
I swear I'd get a divorce
and marry you.

865
01:09:24,501 --> 01:09:26,801
I didn't ask you to buy my violets.

866
01:09:37,702 --> 01:09:39,000
No.

867
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:41,200
No!

868
01:09:41,501 --> 01:09:45,001
Well now, Miss Robinson, the Chicago train
arrived a half hour ago...

869
01:09:45,042 --> 01:09:47,102
and I'm sure he'll come direct
to the office.

870
01:09:47,303 --> 01:09:48,703
I'll tell him.

871
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,500
- Did you have a nice trip?
- Horrible!

872
01:10:04,601 --> 01:10:06,900
Leave me alone.
I can still take off my own coat.

873
01:10:07,701 --> 01:10:10,501
Out of the last fourteen nights
I spent nine of them in pullmans.

874
01:10:11,802 --> 01:10:13,102
Well, how are things running?

875
01:10:13,903 --> 01:10:15,700
Oh, everything's perfect.

876
01:10:15,701 --> 01:10:18,601
Did that order go out I wired
on Saturday?

877
01:10:18,802 --> 01:10:20,702
Oh, well, no.

878
01:10:20,903 --> 01:10:22,603
Well, why wasn't it shipped?

879
01:10:22,634 --> 01:10:24,304
It wasn't marked rush.

880
01:10:25,605 --> 01:10:27,900
The other orders I wired,
have any of them been sent?

881
01:10:28,101 --> 01:10:30,501
No, I thought I'd better hold them
till you got back.

882
01:10:30,902 --> 01:10:33,202
Go out and get all that stuff
and get it off right away.

883
01:10:34,403 --> 01:10:36,303
Oh, I can't.

884
01:10:36,504 --> 01:10:38,204
You can't?
Why not?

885
01:10:38,205 --> 01:10:41,500
Well, I put them all in a folder
and took them up to your house.

886
01:10:42,401 --> 01:10:46,200
Telephone my house and have my Martin my
valet bring the folder down here right away.

887
01:10:46,231 --> 01:10:49,700
Well, I'm afraid they got lost
last night in the confusion.

888
01:10:50,501 --> 01:10:52,500
Confusion? What confusion?

889
01:10:54,101 --> 01:10:55,801
In the fire.

890
01:10:55,902 --> 01:10:58,602
Fire? What fire?

891
01:10:58,633 --> 01:11:01,100
The fire in your library.

892
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:05,301
Fire in my library?

893
01:11:06,402 --> 01:11:08,200
And in your bedroom too.

894
01:11:08,231 --> 01:11:11,000
But some of your clothes
can be salvaged.

895
01:11:11,701 --> 01:11:13,701
What are you talking about?

896
01:11:14,302 --> 01:11:16,900
Well, Martin thinks he can fix
some of your clothes...

897
01:11:16,921 --> 01:11:18,700
as soon as he gets out of the hospital.

898
01:11:18,721 --> 01:11:19,999
Hospital?

899
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,600
How did this fire start?

900
01:11:28,901 --> 01:11:31,601
Well, the firemen were very nasty.

901
01:11:31,632 --> 01:11:33,780
They said it started from my cigarette.

902
01:11:33,799 --> 01:11:36,381
Your cigarette? What were you doing
smoking in my house?

903
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:39,382
Oh, I just sat down to smoke
a cigarette...

904
01:11:39,399 --> 01:11:42,883
And don't you believe it, Jim,
I didn't fall asleep.

905
01:11:42,899 --> 01:11:45,784
I was just thinking with
my eyes closed.

906
01:11:50,985 --> 01:11:53,555
Are you sure you told me everything?

907
01:11:53,576 --> 01:11:56,500
Think carefully, now.
Has the firm gone into bankruptcy?

908
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:58,300
Or is my fiancée dead?

909
01:11:58,301 --> 01:12:00,601
Oh no, Miss Robinson's not dead.

910
01:12:00,632 --> 01:12:04,600
She's been calling you for the last week
wondering why she hasn't heard from you.

911
01:12:06,301 --> 01:12:07,700
Get her on the phone.

912
01:12:13,201 --> 01:12:15,441
Now, isn't that a coincidence?

913
01:12:15,462 --> 01:12:17,642
Speak of the devil and here she is.

914
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,843
Get out!

915
01:12:30,244 --> 01:12:31,900
- Hello, darling.
- Well!

916
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:34,650
What's the matter?
You look a bit wild-eyed.

917
01:12:34,671 --> 01:12:37,151
Nothing, nothing at all, dear.

918
01:12:37,192 --> 01:12:40,452
You must have been busy.
I had no letters from you.

919
01:12:40,499 --> 01:12:42,553
Only three little telegrams.

920
01:12:42,554 --> 01:12:45,354
And not a word for the past five days.

921
01:12:45,355 --> 01:12:48,300
Look, Helen, for the past fourteen days
I've been leaping in and out of pullmans...

922
01:12:48,321 --> 01:12:51,201
and living in lumber camps.
I simply didn't have the time.

923
01:12:51,222 --> 01:12:53,400
Well, I'm glad you don't have
to travel often.

924
01:12:53,421 --> 01:12:55,701
I don't fancy myself as a neglected wife.

925
01:12:55,722 --> 01:12:57,300
I've got to do a lot of travelling.

926
01:12:57,321 --> 01:12:59,200
The paper business is in a critical state.

927
01:12:59,201 --> 01:13:01,201
Newspapers are buying up
their own mills.

928
01:13:01,222 --> 01:13:02,500
Syndicates are being formed.

929
01:13:02,521 --> 01:13:05,901
By next year I'm gonna be a leaping
tuna all over these United States.

930
01:13:05,932 --> 01:13:08,050
But you don't have to do all
the dirty work.

931
01:13:08,071 --> 01:13:10,201
But I do. Nobody else can
do it as well.

932
01:13:10,202 --> 01:13:12,702
I'm not blowing my own horn,
it's simply the truth.

933
01:13:12,723 --> 01:13:14,103
So you might as well face it.

934
01:13:14,204 --> 01:13:17,204
It's much better to say things
in advance.

935
01:13:18,405 --> 01:13:19,800
Isn't it?

936
01:13:19,801 --> 01:13:22,201
Yes, dear.
Now, dear, please run along.

937
01:13:22,222 --> 01:13:24,102
I'm up to my neck in trouble.

938
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:30,903
Why I ever let Mary Linden
get away from me, I...

939
01:13:30,904 --> 01:13:33,300
I ought to have my head examined,
that's all.

940
01:13:33,321 --> 01:13:35,600
If I could find her now, I'd give her
half the company to come back.

941
01:13:39,701 --> 01:13:42,250
- I think not!
- Huh?

942
01:13:42,302 --> 01:13:45,502
Do you think I want a woman around here
who's madly in love with you?

943
01:13:45,533 --> 01:13:48,600
Mary? In love with me?
Rot!

944
01:13:48,701 --> 01:13:51,600
You did a lot of night work
together, you two.

945
01:13:51,631 --> 01:13:53,501
Say, listen, darling,
you're a little mad.

946
01:13:54,702 --> 01:13:57,200
I'm no saint. I have my moments.

947
01:13:57,241 --> 01:14:00,600
But Mary Linden simply isn't
that kind of a girl, that's all.

948
01:14:01,401 --> 01:14:03,000
Jim!

949
01:14:04,201 --> 01:14:07,201
There's a cop out here and he wants
to arrest me.

950
01:14:07,802 --> 01:14:10,280
The arson squad wants her at
headquarters for a statement...

951
01:14:10,299 --> 01:14:13,781
about the connection between her cigarette
and the fire in your home last night.

952
01:14:14,482 --> 01:14:18,000
I have no suspicions of you, Daisy.
Run along.

953
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:20,983
You see, nobody has any
suspicion of me.

954
01:14:21,684 --> 01:14:23,000
Come on.

955
01:14:27,501 --> 01:14:32,201
Oh, no.
Nobody has any suspicions of you.

956
01:14:37,302 --> 01:14:40,402
I'm disgusted.
And humiliated.

957
01:14:40,433 --> 01:14:42,650
All the time it's been that
cheap little tart...

958
01:14:42,671 --> 01:14:44,900
and I thought it was Mary Linden.

959
01:14:50,601 --> 01:14:52,901
Did you do anything to get
Mary Linden to leave here?

960
01:14:52,932 --> 01:14:54,100
- Certainly.
- Well how dare you...

961
01:14:54,101 --> 01:14:55,270
interfere in my business affairs!

962
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:58,581
Business? That's good, a woman
like Mary Linden.

963
01:14:58,599 --> 01:15:01,662
With Mary Linden as a woman, you may
have had a feminine right to be involved.

964
01:15:01,683 --> 01:15:05,663
But with Mary Linden, my private secretary,
you had absolutely no right to interfere.

965
01:15:05,964 --> 01:15:08,400
- I believe you're in love with her.
- Listen,

966
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:11,901
I fall madly in love with any woman
who displays a least bit of common sense.

967
01:15:12,102 --> 01:15:15,102
And now you must forgive me
if I'm rude, but I'm terribly busy.

968
01:15:15,103 --> 01:15:18,203
- Too busy, I'm afraid.
- Well, I suppose we'll let it go at that.

969
01:15:23,504 --> 01:15:25,704
Get me Mary Linden's apartment
on the wire.

970
01:15:26,805 --> 01:15:29,900
Why, Mr. Duneen, Mary Linden
has moved.

971
01:15:36,001 --> 01:15:40,101
I'm sorry, I haven't the slightest idea
where to reach her.

972
01:16:04,002 --> 01:16:05,900
Hello? Who is it?

973
01:16:05,991 --> 01:16:08,700
It's Dolores. Are you awake?

974
01:16:08,701 --> 01:16:11,600
Yes, I'm awake, you idiot.
Come on up.

975
01:16:34,201 --> 01:16:37,771
- Hi! How's tricks?
- No tricks by me.

976
01:16:37,792 --> 01:16:39,500
What gets you up so early?

977
01:16:39,501 --> 01:16:43,901
Oh, Freddie got jealous last night
and broke all my Rudy Vallee records.

978
01:16:45,202 --> 01:16:47,800
So I threw him out and went
to bed early.

979
01:16:50,401 --> 01:16:51,801
Got a job yet?

980
01:16:51,852 --> 01:16:53,202
Nope.

981
01:16:54,403 --> 01:16:56,853
Well, ain't it about time
you went to work?

982
01:16:56,854 --> 01:17:00,154
No hurry. I don't care if I don't
work for months yet.

983
01:17:02,155 --> 01:17:04,850
Jim Duneen tried to get in touch
with you last week.

984
01:17:04,871 --> 01:17:06,000
He did?

985
01:17:06,201 --> 01:17:08,100
What did you tell him?

986
01:17:08,701 --> 01:17:11,201
Exactly what you told me to.

987
01:17:16,602 --> 01:17:18,902
I wonder what he wanted.

988
01:17:20,003 --> 01:17:22,000
How should I know?

989
01:17:22,999 --> 01:17:25,401
Say, did I tell you Daisy got canned?

990
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:27,502
- No!
- Uh-huh.

991
01:17:32,703 --> 01:17:35,203
No... nothing there.

992
01:17:35,804 --> 01:17:39,404
The marines have landed and the situation
is well in hand.

993
01:17:42,505 --> 01:17:44,405
Well listen to this.

994
01:17:44,466 --> 01:17:48,056
The forthcoming marriage of
Miss Ellen Robinson...

995
01:17:48,057 --> 01:17:52,157
to Mr. James Duneen has been
called off by mutual consent.

996
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,458
Where, Dolores, let me see, where?

997
01:17:56,459 --> 01:18:00,500
Oh, it isn't in the paper. But it's liable
to be any minute now.

998
01:18:00,501 --> 01:18:03,450
Or I've been listening in over that
switchboard in vain.

999
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:05,251
- Dolores!
- Mary!

1000
01:18:05,452 --> 01:18:07,000
Ain't that great?

1001
01:18:15,901 --> 01:18:18,700
Mr. Duneen, are we going to work
again tonight?

1002
01:18:18,731 --> 01:18:21,800
These late hours are just ruining
my boyfriend's evenings.

1003
01:18:21,821 --> 01:18:25,701
Yes, tonight and every night until
I find a secretary who's satisfactory.

1004
01:18:26,102 --> 01:18:27,732
Have you got the answers to those
want ads?

1005
01:18:27,753 --> 01:18:29,900
- Yes, here they are.
- Hm.

1006
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:36,301
Hm, this sounds possible.

1007
01:18:36,322 --> 01:18:40,902
For three years secretary to the president
of a pulp and paper concern.

1008
01:18:40,933 --> 01:18:42,303
Best of references.

1009
01:18:43,304 --> 01:18:45,780
Have this Miss Helen Clark come
to come see me this afternoon.

1010
01:18:45,799 --> 01:18:46,981
Yes, sir.

1011
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,082
- Yeah?
- Helen Clark, by appointment.

1012
01:19:07,099 --> 01:19:08,783
Send her in.

1013
01:19:21,484 --> 01:19:23,000
Mr. Duneen?

1014
01:19:27,201 --> 01:19:29,601
I'm Helen Clark.

1015
01:19:30,702 --> 01:19:34,202
Oh, yes, Miss Clark.
Won't you sit down?

1016
01:19:38,403 --> 01:19:39,803
Thank you.

1017
01:19:49,204 --> 01:19:53,204
I, uh...
I see you've had office experience.

1018
01:19:55,205 --> 01:19:58,500
Yes, I left my last employer
because he got engaged.

1019
01:20:02,001 --> 01:20:04,401
Mary Linden, take off those clothes
and be yourself!

1020
01:20:04,422 --> 01:20:07,700
Oh, Mr. Duneen, do you always.
ask girls to disrobe in your office?

1021
01:20:07,723 --> 01:20:09,150
I didn't mean that, you know I didn't.

1022
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:11,300
I mean, take off your coat,
we've got work to do.

1023
01:20:11,321 --> 01:20:12,900
But I get $100 a week now.

1024
01:20:12,921 --> 01:20:16,101
All right, Mary, of course $100
is all right. Stop joking.

1025
01:20:16,102 --> 01:20:18,200
I've got just three days to get
affairs in shape...

1026
01:20:18,221 --> 01:20:20,600
so I can beat it up north
and cover next year's supply.

1027
01:20:21,503 --> 01:20:24,303
Well... what are you standing
there like that for?

1028
01:20:24,804 --> 01:20:28,404
Oh, Mary, please. I need you.
Don't turn me down now.

1029
01:20:28,405 --> 01:20:30,300
Grab a notebook and get to work.

1030
01:20:37,501 --> 01:20:40,801
Corbin. Don't ring me
no matter who it is.

1031
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:43,002
And you stay at that switchboard ready
to take any calls that come in...

1032
01:20:43,023 --> 01:20:44,600
till I tell you you can go.

1033
01:20:44,601 --> 01:20:46,401
I'm going to do a day's work.

1034
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,202
Come on, Jim.

1035
01:20:52,233 --> 01:20:54,403
Take a letter to the Stockholm crowd.

1036
01:20:55,804 --> 01:20:59,604
Uh... After due consideration...

1037
01:20:59,625 --> 01:21:01,305
of your proposition,

1038
01:21:02,206 --> 01:21:04,000
I have decided to...

1039
01:21:13,901 --> 01:21:15,601
Ritter and Company.

1040
01:21:17,302 --> 01:21:19,502
Oh, Freddie.

1041
01:21:19,523 --> 01:21:23,903
I've been waiting for hours for that
big stiff to let me go home...

1042
01:21:23,934 --> 01:21:25,800
and he's still dictating.

1043
01:21:27,301 --> 01:21:29,201
Shut up, Freddie.

1044
01:21:29,502 --> 01:21:32,800
Freddie, will you please shut up!

1045
01:21:35,501 --> 01:21:38,600
Shut up till I get my heart
beating properly.

1046
01:21:38,701 --> 01:21:40,551
Why do you think?

1047
01:21:40,552 --> 01:21:43,900
He ain't dictating.
He's through dictating.

1048
01:21:43,931 --> 01:21:47,400
He's gone over to Jersey City
to marry Mary Linden.

1049
01:21:47,491 --> 01:21:49,401
Oh, ain't that grand?

1050
01:21:50,402 --> 01:21:59,402
