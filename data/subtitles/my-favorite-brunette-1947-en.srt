1
00:01:15,192 --> 00:01:17,402
Hey Warden, when is he going?

2
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:19,076
Taking him down now.

3
00:01:19,077 --> 00:01:20,729
Guess you think there should
be a pardon Warden.

4
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,809
Looks bad.

5
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:23,409
How do you think he will take it?

6
00:01:23,643 --> 00:01:25,329
Like a soldier my boy.

7
00:01:25,726 --> 00:01:29,258
No ketchup? This is the
worst last meal I ever had.

8
00:01:29,451 --> 00:01:31,137
Sorry Jackson, here's the Warden.

9
00:01:33,136 --> 00:01:35,378
Surely glad to see you Warden.
So the Governor came throught

10
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:37,501
with that stay, I knew he
would he's a very good guy.

11
00:01:37,502 --> 00:01:40,111
Sorry Jackson, no word from the Governor.

12
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:41,474
Sorry.

13
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:45,793
No word?

14
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,122
No word, ah?

15
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:55,216
Well, I know who to
vote for next time.

16
00:01:55,806 --> 00:01:56,808
Come on Jackson.

17
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:09,592
Nice cosy little nook.

18
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,034
So that's it. Mind if I take a look?

19
00:02:17,035 --> 00:02:18,476
I wouldn't advise it.

20
00:02:18,477 --> 00:02:20,608
You're getting soft Warden.

21
00:02:25,286 --> 00:02:28,180
Gas. Haven't even put in electricity.

22
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:30,303
Right in here, Jackson.

23
00:02:37,903 --> 00:02:41,467
I'm going to grant you a special
privilege not often given to a man

24
00:02:41,468 --> 00:02:42,835
in your position.

25
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,405
It's what you've asked for. The chance
to tell your story to the newspapers.

26
00:02:48,157 --> 00:02:50,812
To get a cough off your chest.
Thanks, Warden.

27
00:02:52,202 --> 00:02:54,048
See you in a while Jackson.

28
00:02:54,606 --> 00:02:56,133
I'll be right here.

29
00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:01,937
Mr Jackson I think you're wonderful.
You've really got what it takes.

30
00:03:02,376 --> 00:03:04,738
I ain't exactly a cream puff.
Cigarette?

31
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,061
Nevermind.
Thanks George.

32
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,908
There might be a saw in that one.

33
00:03:09,185 --> 00:03:11,708
Well you've got what I call gutts.

34
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:14,113
The way I figured...
Anybody got a match?

35
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:19,879
The way I figured if a guy feels in
his heart he's taking a phoney rap

36
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,614
it's not so tough to kick the bucket.

37
00:03:22,964 --> 00:03:25,254
It's not so tough to
walk that last mile.

38
00:03:25,768 --> 00:03:28,456
It's just... tough to light a cigarette, that's all.

39
00:03:31,335 --> 00:03:33,617
Say Jackson, how did
you get into this mess?

40
00:03:33,618 --> 00:03:34,985
Where's the go?
Woman?

41
00:03:35,461 --> 00:03:39,185
It's always a woman.
You should have seen this woman.

42
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:42,469
Skin like smooth satin.
Beautiful blue eyes.

43
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:47,768
Dark silken hair. Kind of a gal that make
you want to give away your last shirt.

44
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:51,041
I borrowed this from the Warden.
This girl...

45
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:52,443
How did you meet her?
Did she come up to your office?

46
00:03:52,444 --> 00:03:53,524
Did you fall in love with her?

47
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,126
Wait a minute, one at a time.

48
00:03:55,127 --> 00:03:57,896
You may not know this but
I wasn't always a detective.

49
00:03:58,612 --> 00:04:01,174
Before they pinned this murder
up on me I had the sweetest

50
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:02,697
sort of racket in San Francisco.

51
00:04:02,698 --> 00:04:05,591
A legitimate business?
Better than legitimate, it was profitable.

52
00:04:05,902 --> 00:04:09,626
My office was in the Trafalgar Building,
just down the edge of Chinatown.

53
00:04:09,627 --> 00:04:12,110
In Chinatown.
No, not right in.

54
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:14,641
Do you know California Street,
in the hill of Stockton?

55
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:19,281
Coming down the hill on a cable car
you could just see my office.

56
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:25,418
Third floor front. Ronnie was the name,
"Ronnie, baby photographer".

57
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:30,134
I'll never forget that day. For two hours
I'd been trying to make that little brat smile.

58
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:33,062
I threw the book at him
every sure-fire trick of the trade

59
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:54,729
This kid is going to grow
up to be a spotser.

60
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,855
He's even wearing out the light.

61
00:05:00,856 --> 00:05:02,348
Quick, snap it!

62
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:04,990
Watch the birdie!

63
00:05:05,662 --> 00:05:08,345
There you are, another masterpiece.

64
00:05:08,346 --> 00:05:10,511
Sweetheart you're wonderful.

65
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,152
You're wonderful too, Mr Jackson.

66
00:05:13,153 --> 00:05:15,477
That's because I was a kid once myself.

67
00:05:21,644 --> 00:05:24,936
I'm just dying to see those proofs.
When will they be ready?

68
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:28,776
The first thing in the morning Mrs Fong.
I'm sure you'll like them.

69
00:05:29,214 --> 00:05:31,983
Goodbye you little rascal.

70
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,583
Hold them off!
Give Mr Jackson back his fingers!

71
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:38,669
Time! Time!
Hold them off!

72
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,203
Doesn't he get meat at home?

73
00:05:42,752 --> 00:05:44,757
You happy little Gourmet.

74
00:05:45,716 --> 00:05:48,451
He's sweet though.
Let me see.

75
00:05:50,162 --> 00:05:55,130
"Baby photographer. A fine job for a two
fisted he-man like Ronnie Jackson.

76
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,704
I had promised to have pictures of the kid
ready by morning so I got to work at develop.

77
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:03,299
Must have been about 20 minutes later,
half an hour or something like that

78
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,510
when I heard a door slam
in the hallway outside.

79
00:06:05,784 --> 00:06:08,907
I knew it was Sam McCloud coming
back to his office on a busy day

80
00:06:08,908 --> 00:06:11,642
padding the goods of a fewer
sort of croocks and murders.

81
00:06:11,712 --> 00:06:15,438
Sam McCloud, the coolest, thoughest
private eye in the business.

82
00:06:15,597 --> 00:06:20,245
I wanted to be a detective too.
It only took brain, courage and a gun.

83
00:06:20,403 --> 00:06:22,408
And I had the gun.

84
00:06:22,526 --> 00:06:26,582
I'd figured out a way for Sam to hire me,
so I started across the hall.

85
00:06:26,812 --> 00:06:31,297
Already I could see my name at big letters
"Ronnie Jackson, private eye".

86
00:06:31,298 --> 00:06:35,707
What I didn't see was the small print
underneath: "Rest in peace".

87
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:40,842
Don't worry your pretty
little head about that, baby.

88
00:06:42,473 --> 00:06:43,715
Hi Sam.

89
00:06:44,356 --> 00:06:48,571
Listen baby, it will take more
than a couple of guns to scare me

90
00:06:51,485 --> 00:06:55,097
Let's talk it over some rainy
night in front of a nice warm fire

91
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,216
I'll bring the matches.

92
00:06:59,055 --> 00:07:00,742
What's on your mind, Ronnie?

93
00:07:00,818 --> 00:07:05,824
Matches... No, I mean, look Sam, it
came today, license and everything

94
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,466
now can I be your partner?

95
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:11,071
I told you before, stick to watching
the birdie and you'll die of old age.

96
00:07:11,072 --> 00:07:12,993
But I was cut up for this kind of life.

97
00:07:12,994 --> 00:07:16,117
For all my life I wanted to be a hard-boiled
detective like Humphrey Bogart,

98
00:07:16,118 --> 00:07:18,932
Dick Powell, even Alan Ladd.

99
00:07:19,563 --> 00:07:24,328
Have those beautiful women coming into the
office, those warm fires and those rainy nights

100
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:26,939
that's the kind of life I want.
How about that Sam?

101
00:07:34,343 --> 00:07:35,756
Smooth, ah?

102
00:07:36,506 --> 00:07:40,951
I can be a lot of help to you.
Here's my latest inventions, right here.

103
00:07:40,952 --> 00:07:43,474
A camera with a keyhole lens.

104
00:07:43,475 --> 00:07:47,964
Takes pictures throught doors.
I've been kicked out of five hotels already.

105
00:07:49,363 --> 00:07:51,966
How about that Sam?
Can I go to work for you?

106
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:54,371
Just give me a simple yes or no.

107
00:07:55,211 --> 00:07:56,252
No.

108
00:07:56,253 --> 00:08:00,388
That's too simple.
Why don't you give a little thought?

109
00:08:00,859 --> 00:08:04,262
I'm going to Chicago for a few days.
I'll leave the door open

110
00:08:04,263 --> 00:08:06,473
so you come through
and answer the phone.

111
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:15,680
Little stiff.

112
00:08:20,485 --> 00:08:23,128
I could go with you, I've got
a coat just like that.

113
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:26,980
I could help you out a bit in case
you're around any keyhole work...

114
00:08:27,415 --> 00:08:31,026
You're sure there's nothing I can do for you?
Keep your nose clean.

115
00:08:34,184 --> 00:08:36,866
That's the last chance I'll give him.

116
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:40,431
Keep my nose clean.
Answer the phone.

117
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:45,206
Either go in business for myself.
"Ronnie Jackson, private eye".

118
00:08:47,802 --> 00:08:52,770
I could catch those gunned-up hassles
over a warm fire even if it wasn't raining

119
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,815
Drink as much as he can.

120
00:09:37,229 --> 00:09:42,196
I suppose you wonder why I act this way.
No, every girl that comes in here does it.

121
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:46,881
I need a detective.
Please say that you'll help me.

122
00:09:46,882 --> 00:09:51,017
Yes, but look, I'm just...
Please Mr McCloud, please.

123
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:54,411
Just call me Sam.

124
00:09:54,412 --> 00:09:58,103
This is my type of case.
Spit out sister.

125
00:09:58,778 --> 00:10:02,947
My name is Carlotta Montay,
baroness Montay.

126
00:10:03,664 --> 00:10:04,952
A baroness?

127
00:10:06,548 --> 00:10:09,921
I feel as tough someone's watching me.
Yes, that's me.

128
00:10:13,117 --> 00:10:18,124
I arrived here three days ago on the
Queen of Perl], with the Baron, my husband.

129
00:10:18,925 --> 00:10:20,338
Oh, you've got a husband.

130
00:10:23,651 --> 00:10:26,294
This was taken the day we arrived.

131
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:30,099
Two columns cut from "San Francisco
Citizen", he must read.

132
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,302
I'm in trouble, deep trouble.

133
00:10:32,303 --> 00:10:35,386
What's the wheel chair for?
My husband is an invalid.

134
00:10:35,387 --> 00:10:38,510
Hasn't been out of that wheel chair
in seven years.

135
00:10:38,511 --> 00:10:41,325
You're in trouble.
Keep talking.

136
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:46,081
At the dock I went to get the
luggage through the custom

137
00:10:46,082 --> 00:10:51,088
I was gone 5, 10 minutes at the most.
When I returned he had disappeared.

138
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,973
That's snatch job.
Have you gone to the police?

139
00:10:54,974 --> 00:10:59,941
No. If I go to the police they'll kill him.

140
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:04,672
Who's they?
That's what I want you to find out.

141
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:12,678
I have no money, but this ring can be
pawned anywhere for at least 5000$.

142
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:16,722
5000 grand is a lot of moolah!
You don't have to...

143
00:11:16,723 --> 00:11:20,407
The ring is nothing.
We Montay are generous.

144
00:11:20,408 --> 00:11:24,573
If you would just find my husband
I would be so grateful.

145
00:11:24,574 --> 00:11:26,776
You will see.

146
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:31,151
I'll bring the matches.
But this isn't necessary.

147
00:11:34,867 --> 00:11:39,003
What's the matter?
Listen, they mustn't find me here.

148
00:11:39,714 --> 00:11:41,796
I don't hear anything.

149
00:11:41,797 --> 00:11:45,852
Be at this address as soon as you can.

150
00:11:46,363 --> 00:11:49,098
Would five minutes be too soon?

151
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,312
We're dealing with dangerous men,
be careful.

152
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:05,307
They mustn't know you're a detective.
Don't worry your pretty little head

153
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:08,476
about that, I'll find your husband.
Foll that I am.

154
00:12:09,234 --> 00:12:11,808
Somebody's coming.

155
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:18,134
Guard this map, with your life.
With my life?

156
00:12:18,206 --> 00:12:19,892
Hurry.

157
00:12:30,422 --> 00:12:34,227
It's you Mabel, I'm sorry.

158
00:12:34,828 --> 00:12:36,161
There you are.

159
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,193
Come in the studio someday after hours
and I'll take your picture.

160
00:12:39,194 --> 00:12:41,644
When everybody's gone, no charge.

161
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:47,807
Except for the negatives.
Come right in. Any time.

162
00:13:15,323 --> 00:13:19,413
What are you waiting for,
you want to be a detective, don't you?

163
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,060
See what was that address.

164
00:13:25,457 --> 00:13:28,304
The map, my life.

165
00:13:38,835 --> 00:13:40,167
Smooth.

166
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:52,179
Small bullets.

167
00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:01,905
Ain't this your camera, Ronnie?
Thank you very much.

168
00:14:01,906 --> 00:14:07,796
You don't have to pull no gun on me
to kiss me. Any time.

169
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:15,042
There I was on my own, a missing
husband and a dark eyed dreamboat

170
00:14:15,043 --> 00:14:16,765
gorgeous lips in trouble.

171
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:18,287
What a parallel.

172
00:14:18,288 --> 00:14:23,256
And that mysterious map, the whole thing
just like you'd read in the detective magazine.

173
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:27,499
I head my car to the address the doll gave
me and turns out this place is practically

174
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,471
a slipper jump from town.

175
00:14:29,783 --> 00:14:32,826
Later that afternoon I'm driving
throught the gates of one of those

176
00:14:32,827 --> 00:14:35,198
upper bracket estates
down in the peninsula.

177
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:40,196
Soon I come to another gate, that sure
had been my cue to put the car in reverse.

178
00:14:40,197 --> 00:14:42,202
And then I got a look at the mansion.

179
00:14:42,921 --> 00:14:47,086
What a joint. Must have been something
left over from "Wuthering Heights".

180
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:51,371
The kind of a house that looks like you've
been hunting quails in the hallways?

181
00:14:51,372 --> 00:14:54,460
I didn't know it then, but
I was going to be the quail.

182
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,068
Beautiful day, is it?

183
00:15:02,508 --> 00:15:03,920
Maybe it isn't so beautiful.

184
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,521
It is day, though.

185
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,531
But it's late.

186
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,453
Sort of.

187
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,738
Allow me.

188
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,868
Dr Lundau, good afternoon.
Good afternoon, Kismet.

189
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,397
Baroness Montay is expecting me.

190
00:15:36,113 --> 00:15:39,076
Pronto.
Yes. Won't you come in?

191
00:15:39,077 --> 00:15:40,410
Pronto.

192
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:47,327
Nice cheerful place. What time
do they bring the mummies out?

193
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:51,052
Very amusing sir. Madame la baronesse
is in the living room.

194
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:53,896
Shall I announce you?
Nevermind, I'll take it from here.

195
00:15:53,897 --> 00:15:55,788
May I help you with your coat?

196
00:15:57,221 --> 00:16:00,912
Pardon sir, your collar.

197
00:16:01,988 --> 00:16:04,756
Here we are.
Thanks Cuddles.

198
00:16:06,073 --> 00:16:07,840
Very amusing.

199
00:16:22,776 --> 00:16:26,422
Miss Montay.
Hallo. Pretty song, isn't it?

200
00:16:28,063 --> 00:16:29,874
Pretty, but you were so anxious...

201
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:20,253
Quick. First I must know this.
Are you a man who's afraid of danger?

202
00:17:21,455 --> 00:17:26,461
No, you can get as close as you like.
I'm with you to my dying breath.

203
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:30,025
Please you mustn't.
Yeah, better not leave any fingerprints.

204
00:17:30,026 --> 00:17:35,032
Listen, my uncle baron Montay
came to this country

205
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:38,759
Your uncle? I thought you said
the guy was your husband.

206
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,445
I had to have your help.
I know men.

207
00:17:44,446 --> 00:17:48,530
Somehow they always seem to be more
interested in the problems of young wives

208
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:50,974
with older husbands.

209
00:17:50,975 --> 00:17:55,460
No, it just seems I would to you.
Please listen.

210
00:17:55,461 --> 00:17:58,944
My uncle came to this country
on a very important mission.

211
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:02,477
So important that he wouldn't tell
anyone about it, not even me.

212
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:08,281
You uncle, not your husband. Well, did I
quote you any rates, I may work cheaper.

213
00:18:08,358 --> 00:18:12,209
Please, not now.
Too fast, OK.

214
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:18,415
Did your uncle have any enemies?
Not that I know of.

215
00:18:20,094 --> 00:18:23,097
How about this house?
Who lives here?

216
00:18:23,098 --> 00:18:26,261
It belongs to a major Simon Montague.

217
00:18:26,262 --> 00:18:29,236
He was a former business partner of the
baron's.

218
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:34,152
When my uncle disappeared I was frantic.
Sol called major Montague

219
00:18:34,153 --> 00:18:36,158
and he offered to help me.

220
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:41,722
What do you know about him?
My uncle trusted him placidly.

221
00:18:41,723 --> 00:18:46,730
And still he treats me like a child.
Tells me not to worry.

222
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,453
Says that he's handling things.

223
00:18:49,454 --> 00:18:53,430
And all the time I feel as
though I'm being watched.

224
00:18:55,902 --> 00:19:00,107
And he's been sweet and
kind ever since my arrival.

225
00:19:00,108 --> 00:19:04,403
Getting kind of dark in here.
We were talking about you.

226
00:19:04,754 --> 00:19:09,600
Something flattering I hope?
Maybe I shouldn’t listen to it.

227
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:13,004
If there's anything warm to my
heart it's finding out people like me

228
00:19:13,005 --> 00:19:17,010
as much as I like them.
I don't believe I've ever had the honour sir.

229
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:20,855
Mr Craig.
Hi Mr. Craig. Glad to see you.

230
00:19:20,856 --> 00:19:24,300
I thought your name was Craig
I'm Craig too, that's quite a coincidence.

231
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:27,195
Major Montague I met
Mr Craig on shipboard.

232
00:19:27,745 --> 00:19:32,310
Still a little seasick.
It's a pleasure, son.

233
00:19:32,311 --> 00:19:35,515
Anything I can do for you while you're
in the country, you just speak up.

234
00:19:35,516 --> 00:19:36,359
Thank you sir.

235
00:19:37,238 --> 00:19:40,246
Would you have a cigar?
No thanks, I'm driving.

236
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:44,010
Craig, where have I
heard that name before?

237
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:50,455
Madame, there's a phone call for you.
Please take the message.

238
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:53,110
After all Carlotta,
it may be important.

239
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,711
Yes, you're quite right.

240
00:19:57,746 --> 00:19:59,637
Excuse me Mr Craig.

241
00:20:04,555 --> 00:20:08,121
All right sir, now we'll quit playing.
Yeah.

242
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:11,888
How do you do Mr McCloud?

243
00:20:12,926 --> 00:20:17,621
Craig is the name, Elliott Craig.
I was on shipboard...

244
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:22,303
You know that...
You're a private detective.

245
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:25,746
Yeah, just call me Sam.

246
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:29,948
Just to show you my heart's in the
right place I'm going to help you

247
00:20:29,949 --> 00:20:32,231
do a little detecting.
This way, son.

248
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,724
Coming dad.

249
00:20:34,676 --> 00:20:36,601
I may have a little surprise for you.

250
00:20:39,402 --> 00:20:42,125
You pardon us gentlemen,
this is Mr McCloud.

251
00:20:42,126 --> 00:20:46,691
Mr McLoud I'd like you to meet...
The man in the picture! Baron Montay!

252
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:50,576
How do you do?
She said you'd been snatched!

253
00:20:50,577 --> 00:20:54,189
You have my word for it, I'm not a mirage.

254
00:20:54,582 --> 00:20:59,148
Yeah, but she told me, she
seemed so... I don't get it.

255
00:20:59,149 --> 00:21:02,873
Such a lovely girl, the very flower
of a young woman, too.

256
00:21:02,874 --> 00:21:07,488
Perhaps Dr Lundau can tell you about her.
I believe you've met the doctor?

257
00:21:11,325 --> 00:21:15,209
Yes, we had a long talk outside.
Beautiful day, isn't it?

258
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:19,455
I said that.
Well Mr McCloud, as you perhaps know

259
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:23,941
it is not the habit of a psychiatrist
to put on display the skeletons

260
00:21:23,942 --> 00:21:28,949
in anyone's family closet. However,
I believe you are entitled to an explanation

261
00:21:29,189 --> 00:21:32,562
of the strange behaviour
of baron Montay's wife.

262
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:36,438
Wife? She just told me
she was his niece.

263
00:21:36,439 --> 00:21:40,644
Last week she was his little sister.
It is not funny, major.

264
00:21:40,645 --> 00:21:45,651
For the past six months Mrs Montay has been
suffering from an acute form of schizophrenia

265
00:21:46,452 --> 00:21:51,420
accompanied by visual elaboration and
increasingly severe paranoid delusions.

266
00:21:53,141 --> 00:21:54,987
And how was she mentally?

267
00:21:55,785 --> 00:21:59,789
I'm afraid Mr. McCloud is a Harvard man.
I am not.

268
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,994
Fermounth High, Cleveland.

269
00:22:02,995 --> 00:22:05,729
Won't you sit here, please?

270
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:12,567
I'll try to simplify the case.
Make it easy on yourself

271
00:22:12,568 --> 00:22:14,140
I've had along...

272
00:22:16,974 --> 00:22:20,818
Miss Montay has an obsession
that her own life is in danger.

273
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:24,191
She believes that her uncle
has been kidnapped.

274
00:22:24,263 --> 00:22:29,801
Gee... I mean, why don't you bring
her in here and show her the baron?

275
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:32,602
That's what I'd do.

276
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:40,364
No senor. It would be too
severe a mental shock.

277
00:22:40,365 --> 00:22:44,899
My idea is to break down her
fear with suggestive therapy.

278
00:22:45,612 --> 00:22:49,016
Does she snap her cap very often? I mean
when you invite somebody for dinner

279
00:22:49,017 --> 00:22:51,139
do you take away her knife and fork?

280
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,583
She's only dangerous when
she's emotionally disturbed.

281
00:22:54,584 --> 00:22:58,348
You must have come across many similar
cases in your business, Mr McCloud.

282
00:22:58,349 --> 00:23:02,714
Did you? Oh, me. Sure, I can take
those kids on or leave them alone

283
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:06,042
and I usually leave them alone.
I forget that...

284
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,771
I must get back to the office and file some
fingernails, fingerprints...See you then.

285
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:16,745
My heart goes out to that
poor unfortunate girl.

286
00:23:17,455 --> 00:23:19,817
Her mind is all mixed up.

287
00:23:19,818 --> 00:23:24,544
It's down right piteous. I supposed she
even said something about a map.

288
00:23:24,545 --> 00:23:29,551
She even gave me one to hold for her.
Mysterious map, missing uncle.

289
00:23:30,633 --> 00:23:35,158
Pretty corny. There was something about the
way she looked that made me suspicious.

290
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:38,563
The way she looked I didn't care.
But you kept the map?

291
00:23:38,564 --> 00:23:44,055
Sure, why not? She may
not have it up here, but...

292
00:23:46,054 --> 00:23:47,706
Thank you Kismet.

293
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,421
Watch yourself, son.

294
00:23:51,701 --> 00:23:53,307
Come in, Carlotta dear.

295
00:23:54,826 --> 00:23:58,916
Nutty as a fruitcake, with
all that beautiful frosting.

296
00:23:59,432 --> 00:24:02,555
I was just saying to Mr Craig that
anytime he's in the neighborhood

297
00:24:02,556 --> 00:24:04,960
he should feel free to drop
in and have a julep with us.

298
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:07,121
If you'll all excuse me.

299
00:24:07,122 --> 00:24:10,606
Don't go major, you know the old saying
"three is company two is a crowd".

300
00:24:10,607 --> 00:24:13,136
You'll take care of yourself, son.

301
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:19,177
Here we are alone at last.
Goodbye.

302
00:24:19,178 --> 00:24:22,152
Do you know who that phone call was from?
Napoleon?

303
00:24:25,988 --> 00:24:28,722
Her schizo is about to phrenia.

304
00:24:29,392 --> 00:24:31,557
Why did I get up today?

305
00:24:33,357 --> 00:24:36,921
I just spoke to my uncle.
That's funny, so did I.

306
00:24:36,922 --> 00:24:40,249
Who?
My uncle, baron Montay.

307
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:45,815
He told me not to worry,
but I'm terribly disturbed.

308
00:24:45,894 --> 00:24:50,543
Emotionally?
Yes, he said he was safe.

309
00:24:50,861 --> 00:24:55,266
He's safe alright, I mean... he's safe alright!

310
00:24:55,267 --> 00:24:57,910
But he's not safe, I know he isn't.

311
00:24:57,911 --> 00:24:59,961
No, he's in a terrible spot.

312
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:05,200
But I feel he's in great danger.
Yeah, in great danger, but he's safe alright.

313
00:25:07,163 --> 00:25:10,006
He's safe. Sound like an umpire.

314
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:14,452
Don't you see? Someone forced
him to make that call.

315
00:25:14,453 --> 00:25:17,905
Someone who wants me to
believe that nothing is wrong.

316
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:23,865
Mr McCloud, I don't know what to do.
I'm at my wits' end!

317
00:25:23,866 --> 00:25:25,707
I passed there an hour ago.

318
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:28,951
What's the matter with you?
Me?

319
00:25:28,952 --> 00:25:31,880
You better take the ring back.

320
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,926
Mr McCloud, Sam, you wouldn't
desert me, not now?

321
00:25:40,448 --> 00:25:43,731
No, I just remembered I've got a date with
J. Edgar Hoover, kid never makes a move

322
00:25:43,732 --> 00:25:45,774
without me...
But Sam!

323
00:25:45,775 --> 00:25:48,578
You said we were in the same together,
that you would stick with me

324
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:51,702
till your dying breath.
And I'm getting too close to it.

325
00:25:51,703 --> 00:25:55,587
Don't get upset Miss Montay,
you just listen to the major

326
00:25:55,588 --> 00:26:00,123
He's a very fine man.
He likes you.

327
00:26:00,195 --> 00:26:03,238
So they've been talking to you.
They've been telling you things.

328
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:07,283
You're crazy... I mean, you're being silly!
Nobody's been talking to me.

329
00:26:07,284 --> 00:26:09,688
I haven't even been talking to myself.

330
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:13,451
Yes they have, they told you something.
And you believe them.

331
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:16,506
No, I'm on your side.

332
00:26:18,339 --> 00:26:23,345
Now I know who's at the bottom of all this,
major Simon Montague.

333
00:26:23,346 --> 00:26:27,991
No, we're in this together baby.
Please don't believe them, Sam.

334
00:26:27,992 --> 00:26:31,316
Say you'll help me.
Please.

335
00:26:31,317 --> 00:26:35,372
Please, baby, do it to mama.

336
00:26:38,767 --> 00:26:41,009
Mama knows best.

337
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:45,054
Darling promise me you'll guard
the map with your life.

338
00:26:45,055 --> 00:26:51,345
Yeah the map... map? The map.
Let me take this.

339
00:26:54,147 --> 00:27:01,279
You can open the mail man later.
Gee... 6 o'clock already... so long.

340
00:27:02,278 --> 00:27:05,842
"When I got out of the house, was just
starting for my car when I realised

341
00:27:05,843 --> 00:27:09,046
me and my gun had parted company.
Holster and all.

342
00:27:09,047 --> 00:27:12,051
I figured little Miss Screwball must
have lifted it when she kissed me.

343
00:27:12,052 --> 00:27:15,095
I started to go back for it
but I changed my mind.

344
00:27:15,096 --> 00:27:18,740
I spot a high window around the corner
of the house and decide to climb up

345
00:27:18,741 --> 00:27:23,105
and take a gander. I figured the only way
to get the inside dope is from the outside.

346
00:27:23,106 --> 00:27:28,113
Dope. Sol scampered up the hill in
about three jumps like any other goat

347
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:32,839
And what do you know? The guy who told me
he couldn't walk is out of his wheelchair

348
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,402
and sashaying around chippers at jaybird.

349
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:39,007
Then I knew Carlotta wasn't nuts.
I get out my Brownie

350
00:27:39,008 --> 00:27:42,612
and I'm all set to snap when the
laughing boy gets out of his chair

351
00:27:42,613 --> 00:27:45,536
and starts for the window.
I figure he sees me.

352
00:27:45,537 --> 00:27:50,543
But no, he pulls up the shade right my kisser
like it was ladies night in a Turkish bath.

353
00:27:50,624 --> 00:27:55,630
I'm stymie, but only for a second. The
keyhole! Here's where my gadget pays off.

354
00:27:56,552 --> 00:27:59,595
The greatest invention since
the Albany night ball.

355
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:02,809
This will do what I says.
Next stop Rose Gallery.

356
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:10,690
Watch the birdy... click.

357
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:15,225
Ah Carlotta.
What am I saying?

358
00:28:20,143 --> 00:28:22,706
He saw the baron. He took a picture.

359
00:28:22,707 --> 00:28:24,909
Get that camera before
I take the height of you.

360
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,641
All right.
There he goes.

361
00:28:28,755 --> 00:28:31,649
Hurry. Close the gate.

362
00:28:56,072 --> 00:28:58,362
Steep on it.

363
00:29:07,127 --> 00:29:09,371
Come on take this shortcut.

364
00:29:33,442 --> 00:29:35,129
Too fast for them.

365
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:42,696
We've lost him. He must have taken
the other road. Turn around!

366
00:29:53,389 --> 00:29:56,078
Ehi you big road hog, why do you...

367
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:56,275
Hallo honey this is Joe.
Come on up Joe, where have you been?

368
00:31:01,281 --> 00:31:03,412
That Joe. What a man he must be.

369
00:31:04,085 --> 00:31:06,853
Open.
Don't, it's the finance company.

370
00:31:09,332 --> 00:31:11,257
I must remember this address.

371
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:18,672
That will cool you up, Joe.

372
00:31:35,287 --> 00:31:38,169
Didn't think you'd do
after that bath we had.

373
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,692
You doll, you.

374
00:31:39,693 --> 00:31:42,347
We both came through like men.

375
00:31:55,834 --> 00:31:59,446
Hallo operator, get me the State Police.
Yeah, I'll hang on.

376
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:16,873
Pretty rocking.
Smooth though.

377
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,121
Cuddles, eh?

378
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:31,605
Operator? Nevermind that call.

379
00:32:46,903 --> 00:32:50,959
Very subtle of you to include the negative.

380
00:32:57,197 --> 00:33:00,561
When I came to I was playing
post-office with the floor.

381
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,964
I had a lump on my head
the size of my head.

382
00:33:02,965 --> 00:33:06,569
Inside Toscanini was conducting the
annual concert with real blacksmiths.

383
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:10,546
I looked to the bottle of old pile driver
and decided to stick to the double malts.

384
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:15,861
Then those kids with the hammer
started pounding again...

385
00:33:15,862 --> 00:33:18,024
but the thumping wasn't in my head.

386
00:33:18,025 --> 00:33:23,032
There was somebody knocking on the door,
and it wasn't McClouds', it was mine.

387
00:33:23,192 --> 00:33:25,596
My door in the other room.

388
00:33:27,718 --> 00:33:30,841
Oh it's you.
Here I am Mr Jackson.

389
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,165
My head...
How did it come out?

390
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:34,847
Yankee 4, Cleveland 7.

391
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:38,251
A man of your responsibilities
shouldn't drink.

392
00:33:38,252 --> 00:33:42,502
Who's drinking?
That's a bottle of bean butter.

393
00:33:42,578 --> 00:33:44,231
I want my baby picture.

394
00:33:46,464 --> 00:33:50,508
Picture? Wait a minute.

395
00:33:50,509 --> 00:33:53,119
Where are you going?
Just a second, wait.

396
00:33:55,396 --> 00:33:58,118
They got it. It's gone.
Gone?

397
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:02,564
Let me see, I had it here and I took it there.
That's what happened to sweetie?

398
00:34:02,565 --> 00:34:07,572
No, it's not your baby's picture.
Here's the negative, have it developed.

399
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:12,901
I'm out of business. I'm retired.
Remember that if you have another baby.

400
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,422
Quiet, I'm thinking.

401
00:34:15,423 --> 00:34:20,071
Boy, I've got things to do.
Important things to do.

402
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:24,796
What have I got to do?
Carlotta!

403
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:38,744
There he is, that's the fellow.
Get it.

404
00:34:39,455 --> 00:34:42,418
Watch him, he's one of the gang.
What did you do with the baron?

405
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:45,745
Come clean you've got in some
weenie business. Don't he, fellows?

406
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:48,514
Beg your pardon, what's going on here?

407
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,911
Don't try to look so weightless
with those blue foiled eyes

408
00:34:50,991 --> 00:34:53,440
watch him he's got a knife.
Have you got a knife?

409
00:34:53,514 --> 00:34:56,757
Sure I've got a knife.
I'm the gardener.

410
00:34:56,758 --> 00:34:59,361
What did you think that I was last time? A
chrysanthemum? He tried to prune me.

411
00:34:59,362 --> 00:35:04,127
Hold it bud. ls anyone living in here
with the name of... Carlotta Montay?

412
00:35:04,128 --> 00:35:07,051
Who is Carlotta Montay?
You know who she is.

413
00:35:07,052 --> 00:35:10,215
She's staying here with major Montague.
Who is major Montague?

414
00:35:10,217 --> 00:35:13,981
This house belongs to the Krandals', they've
been in South America for 4 months.

415
00:35:13,982 --> 00:35:16,905
Six months.
Then he's sub-letting.

416
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:20,961
Do you mind if we take a look inside?
No, please come along. Pardon me.

417
00:35:22,994 --> 00:35:23,393
This way.

418
00:35:23,394 --> 00:35:25,396
I'll show you they're all
probably hiding in here.

419
00:35:25,397 --> 00:35:26,206
Stick with me.

420
00:35:29,482 --> 00:35:33,046
What's this?
Looks like nobody home.

421
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:36,251
Nothing personal about that I hope.
What do you think sergeant?

422
00:35:36,252 --> 00:35:37,572
I think a rebuke is in order.

423
00:35:37,573 --> 00:35:40,576
Wait a minute, don't get your
badges out, you're got this all wrong

424
00:35:40,577 --> 00:35:43,060
they fixed my car, they fixed
the gate, they fixed everything

425
00:35:43,061 --> 00:35:45,830
that's their racket and try to make
people think everybody's crazy.

426
00:35:45,905 --> 00:35:47,636
Yes, but with you they had a head style.

427
00:35:47,707 --> 00:35:50,029
Hold on, you got to listen to me,
you got to trust me fellows

428
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,799
this is the biggest frame up
since Whistler's mother.

429
00:35:54,757 --> 00:35:57,439
Wait a minute.
Keep moving, you got a long drive

430
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,243
back to town.
Let me tell you something.

431
00:36:00,244 --> 00:36:02,846
What?
I like long drives.

432
00:36:02,847 --> 00:36:04,659
Get going-

433
00:36:05,131 --> 00:36:07,693
If you bother us again I'll personally
punch you in the nose so hard

434
00:36:07,694 --> 00:36:11,226
that it will look like other people's noses.
It might be worth it.

435
00:36:13,742 --> 00:36:17,306
Sorry we bothered you.
You're not a bad guy for a foreigner.

436
00:36:17,307 --> 00:36:21,111
I'm going to be a citizen.
I'm studying for my examination.

437
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:26,080
Could you gentlemen tell me who was the
eight President of the United States.

438
00:36:29,363 --> 00:36:30,935
So long bud.

439
00:36:45,225 --> 00:36:46,797
He's going round to the back.

440
00:36:47,107 --> 00:36:50,035
You know what to do.
Sure I know.

441
00:36:50,712 --> 00:36:55,718
Not that you fool. Why did he come
back and want to search the house?

442
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:57,120
He's looking for clues.

443
00:36:57,121 --> 00:37:02,088
He wants a clue to Carlotta whereabouts.

444
00:37:02,168 --> 00:37:04,936
See that he finds one.
This one.

445
00:37:09,738 --> 00:37:10,342
Find one.

446
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,134
Looks so easy in those Tarzan pictures.

447
00:39:22,997 --> 00:39:25,572
Her ring!

448
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:31,731
Seacliff Lodge. That's where she is.

449
00:39:33,572 --> 00:39:36,546
Never leave a clue.

450
00:39:57,244 --> 00:40:00,487
"I knew where the doll was,
next move is to find her.

451
00:40:00,488 --> 00:40:03,691
Got back into my Special and start out.

452
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:06,826
An hour later I spot a sign: Seaclifie Lodge.

453
00:40:07,017 --> 00:40:11,382
Sol try to locate the girl pretending
I'm just another guest

454
00:40:11,383 --> 00:40:14,037
looking for a little quiet relaxation.

455
00:40:14,307 --> 00:40:20,037
The place is just what I figured.
A summer resort complete with golf course.

456
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,202
Pardon me, how do you get
to the lodge from here?

457
00:40:26,203 --> 00:40:30,658
That's where I live, straight
ahead, you can't miss it.

458
00:40:32,051 --> 00:40:36,380
Did you notice if a good looking dark haired
girl checked in last night?

459
00:40:36,617 --> 00:40:38,223
Can't talk.

460
00:40:40,142 --> 00:40:43,548
Care to play these last three holes?
It will take you right there.

461
00:40:44,547 --> 00:40:48,273
Ok, how about my car?
They'll send for it.

462
00:40:48,633 --> 00:40:53,361
Crawford is the name, Oliver J. Crawford.
Mine's Smithers.

463
00:40:54,601 --> 00:40:58,245
Nine nine. Care to shoot first?
Ok.

464
00:40:58,246 --> 00:41:01,572
This girl last night did you
notice if she was alone?

465
00:41:02,692 --> 00:41:06,296
Care to make a small wager?
A dollar a hole?

466
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,379
Did you notice if she had a...

467
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,989
You have a full nine,
there's water down there.

468
00:41:27,045 --> 00:41:30,417
Missed it. Cup must have moved, don't it.

469
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:34,264
I feel like a pretty good
rounded day was off.

470
00:41:44,989 --> 00:41:47,917
Like it, I got out of those traps.
I didn't see it.

471
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,252
Right in the cup.

472
00:42:04,495 --> 00:42:06,945
I'll consider that.
Thanks.

473
00:42:10,664 --> 00:42:15,882
For a minute I didn't think you had a ball.
Tough luck old boy. You're only one down.

474
00:42:24,282 --> 00:42:26,811
Where's your ball?
Right here.

475
00:42:27,566 --> 00:42:29,173
Nice slide.

476
00:42:33,094 --> 00:42:36,097
Right on the green.
I can't even see the green.

477
00:42:36,098 --> 00:42:39,582
I can. See Smithers, how about
that buck you owe me?

478
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:41,987
I owe you?
A dollar a hole.

479
00:42:42,547 --> 00:42:46,871
Nice racket you got.
Thanks. George Washington.

480
00:42:46,872 --> 00:42:48,843
Where?
He's staying here, you know?

481
00:42:49,756 --> 00:42:51,878
Got the room next to mine.

482
00:42:51,879 --> 00:42:55,483
Keeps me up all night long playing
Yankee Doodle on his pipe.

483
00:42:55,484 --> 00:42:59,540
Off key.
Why don't you tell Petrullo about it?

484
00:43:02,133 --> 00:43:06,939
Hurry up, quick, grab them, there they go.
I'm looking for you chummy.

485
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:09,628
We're going to see the doctor.
Doctor?

486
00:43:10,785 --> 00:43:14,108
Sanitarium? You got me
wrong, I'm not crazy.

487
00:43:14,109 --> 00:43:18,875
I know, maybe you'd like some walnuts?

488
00:43:18,876 --> 00:43:21,638
Walnuts? Why don't you grab those
nuts, it's strudel and a noodle...

489
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:25,484
I want you.
But I'm ok, I'm sane I'll prove it to you.

490
00:43:25,485 --> 00:43:27,330
Watch this coordination.

491
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:31,021
It's the wrong hand.

492
00:43:33,976 --> 00:43:36,779
I'll practice a little. See you later.

493
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,182
Come on.
Too easy, that's my pinball hand.

494
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:42,587
We're going to see the doctor.
It's no use, but I'm not going with you.

495
00:43:42,588 --> 00:43:44,992
Let's see the doctor.

496
00:43:47,354 --> 00:43:49,678
Watch out or we'll never
get that down again.

497
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,847
That's better but there's a part missing.

498
00:43:56,927 --> 00:43:59,410
A thing like this could be permanent.

499
00:44:00,892 --> 00:44:02,093
Cuddles.

500
00:44:02,094 --> 00:44:04,897
Hallo.
Do they have bellhops here?

501
00:44:04,898 --> 00:44:07,029
Welcome to Seacliff Lodge.

502
00:44:11,026 --> 00:44:13,869
The map? Where's the map?

503
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:16,673
You didn't bring it with you that's very bad.

504
00:44:16,674 --> 00:44:19,727
I didn't expect to see you here.
Get me out of this angle.

505
00:44:20,238 --> 00:44:22,482
Very bad.
Trying to choke somebody?

506
00:44:22,922 --> 00:44:27,007
I don't know what's going
on here but I'm not scared.

507
00:44:27,008 --> 00:44:29,696
You've got company, Madame.
Carlotta.

508
00:44:30,532 --> 00:44:35,057
Sam, I'm sorry.
That's alright baby.

509
00:44:35,058 --> 00:44:38,545
Why did I have to go into this,
now I've got you in this mess too.

510
00:44:42,228 --> 00:44:44,550
Don't go feminine on me.
Alright.

511
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:46,397
Don't go masculine either.

512
00:44:48,997 --> 00:44:54,004
Well.
I didn't know this was going to be formal.

513
00:44:54,204 --> 00:44:56,734
I'll be right with you boss.

514
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:02,615
Move in, sit down son.
You and I are going to have a little talk.

515
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:05,338
I'll do the talk and
you'll do the sitting.

516
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:07,151
I'll do the talking.

517
00:45:09,104 --> 00:45:10,950
I'll do the sitting.

518
00:45:11,027 --> 00:45:14,080
The map, Kismet.
Didn't have it on.

519
00:45:16,554 --> 00:45:19,357
That kind of changes things.
Yes it does.

520
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:23,002
Sam boy. Recently I offered
to buy from baron Montay

521
00:45:23,003 --> 00:45:25,766
the mineral rights of a section of his land.

522
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:30,732
Unfortunately the baron turned my offer
down. He came to this country to make

523
00:45:30,733 --> 00:45:34,578
a deal with somebody else.
Who is this someone else and

524
00:45:34,579 --> 00:45:37,902
what kind of mineral rights?
You're getting too inquisitive son.

525
00:45:37,903 --> 00:45:41,867
And that ain't healthy.
Maybe little carlotta here

526
00:45:41,868 --> 00:45:46,273
is beginning to see the light.
You know I'm very fond in Carlotta

527
00:45:46,274 --> 00:45:48,757
and I don't like to see
you holding out on me.

528
00:45:48,758 --> 00:45:55,332
Lay off of her you phoney... It's a good
thing you're here, I'd be brutal.

529
00:45:58,932 --> 00:46:01,294
Carlotta.
Uncle Stephen.

530
00:46:01,295 --> 00:46:06,300
Are you alright?
Yes child, they haven't harm me.

531
00:46:06,301 --> 00:46:10,306
Is that your uncle? He looks like the guy in
the picture I took.

532
00:46:10,307 --> 00:46:14,912
You should have held on to it, that picture
might have spoiled everything for us.

533
00:46:14,913 --> 00:46:17,115
Light, please, Carlotta.

534
00:46:17,116 --> 00:46:22,123
If you don't mind I'd like to acquaint
the baron with a few basic facts

535
00:46:22,643 --> 00:46:28,773
You see monsieur le barone, we have you,
we have your niece, and...

536
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:32,896
having Mr McCloud we have the map.

537
00:46:32,897 --> 00:46:34,424
Not yet, you haven't.

538
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:41,473
Yes, but before the chrysanthemum
blooms we will have it.

539
00:46:43,512 --> 00:46:45,516
Please put this away, yes?

540
00:46:46,115 --> 00:46:49,479
Come here, Willie.
Let's stop fooling around

541
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,922
I want that map and I want it now.

542
00:46:51,923 --> 00:46:54,365
What you want and what you're
going to get are two different things

543
00:46:54,366 --> 00:46:55,574
I'm not the giving kind.

544
00:47:02,898 --> 00:47:05,140
Temper, Kismet, temper.

545
00:47:05,141 --> 00:47:08,104
Don't be so rough with Sam
He can take it.

546
00:47:08,105 --> 00:47:12,274
The poor boy's dazed,
he don't know what's going on.

547
00:47:15,515 --> 00:47:18,489
I'm sorry honey, I didn't
mean to get so fresh.

548
00:47:20,001 --> 00:47:21,083
It's you?

549
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:26,609
Now, where's the map son?
ls that what you want?

550
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:30,134
Why don't you say so?
You don't have to get it the hard way.

551
00:47:30,135 --> 00:47:32,697
Sam, don't.
What's the use? They'll beat it out of us

552
00:47:32,698 --> 00:47:34,139
anyway, we might as well tell them.

553
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,422
Go on chummy, you tell them.

554
00:47:36,423 --> 00:47:38,985
I hid the map in the water
cooler in my office.

555
00:47:38,986 --> 00:47:40,988
He's lying, I've searched his office.

556
00:47:40,989 --> 00:47:44,913
You looked int he wrong water cooler,
the one I mean is in... Sam.

557
00:47:44,914 --> 00:47:47,918
We might as well tell them the truth.

558
00:47:47,919 --> 00:47:52,168
You'll find the map in the water-cooler
at the ferry building.

559
00:47:53,806 --> 00:47:56,008
Yeah, the ferry building.

560
00:47:56,009 --> 00:48:00,304
In the water cooler by the newsstand
third cup from the top.

561
00:48:00,696 --> 00:48:04,860
We will find out. Tony, should take you
about three hours to get to the

562
00:48:04,861 --> 00:48:07,026
ferry building and back. Get going.

563
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:13,393
Doctor, better register them as patients,
in case they should have an amid

564
00:48:14,154 --> 00:48:18,639
with an accident, usual
papers will be filled out.

565
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,411
If Tony doesn't happen
to find that map...

566
00:48:49,081 --> 00:48:50,847
James Collins.

567
00:48:57,733 --> 00:49:01,219
Sam, can you hear me?

568
00:49:04,302 --> 00:49:06,584
What's up baby?
That cigarette you saw me take

569
00:49:06,585 --> 00:49:09,828
from my uncle, there was
a message in it from him.

570
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:12,311
We've two hours to get out of here.

571
00:49:12,312 --> 00:49:15,844
We've got nothing to worry about
till Tony gets back.

572
00:49:16,358 --> 00:49:18,523
They took all my clothes.
Mine too.

573
00:49:18,601 --> 00:49:20,925
They did?
Oh they did..

574
00:49:22,446 --> 00:49:25,689
Have you got a hairpin?
This is no time to be thinking

575
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:27,292
about your looks

576
00:49:27,293 --> 00:49:29,297
Here.
Good.

577
00:49:33,341 --> 00:49:35,027
How did you know
about that cigarette?

578
00:49:35,303 --> 00:49:40,309
My uncle never smokes so
when he asked me for alight I...

579
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:43,674
He wants us to get in touch
with a James Collins.

580
00:49:43,675 --> 00:49:46,249
Engineering Facts Corporation.

581
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,284
I've seen this done a thousand times.
Who's this James Collins?

582
00:49:51,285 --> 00:49:53,887
I don't know, but we've got to find him.

583
00:49:53,888 --> 00:49:58,293
It's always so simple,just put the hairpin
into the lock, give it a quick twist...

584
00:49:58,294 --> 00:50:02,020
Well, come on in.
Get up, we can play jacks later.

585
00:50:07,947 --> 00:50:09,474
Quick, vanish.

586
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,283
It's you. Ok, take me away.

587
00:50:20,284 --> 00:50:25,290
I brought you some grub
I fixed it all myself.

588
00:50:25,291 --> 00:50:28,254
I haven't got much of an appetite,
if I could take along walk.

589
00:50:28,255 --> 00:50:33,180
Those guys wouldn't let you.
You know chummy I like you.

590
00:50:33,181 --> 00:50:36,825
You've got a funny way of showing it.
I'm still trying to get the corpuscles

591
00:50:36,826 --> 00:50:39,509
to move back in.
I'm sorry.

592
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:41,595
You just don't know your own strength.

593
00:50:45,077 --> 00:50:49,242
You know Willie I like you too.
You do?

594
00:50:49,243 --> 00:50:53,207
Yes sir. What a physique.
Bolted down with legs.

595
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:58,176
And look at those shoulders. And that arm.
Like a sack of door knobs.

596
00:50:58,456 --> 00:51:01,030
Recess.

597
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,507
I'm just kidding.

598
00:51:04,183 --> 00:51:08,751
Do you care if I feel your muscle too?
No, go ahead.

599
00:51:10,111 --> 00:51:12,082
Look around it's there someplace.

600
00:51:13,596 --> 00:51:15,567
There it is.
That's it.

601
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,365
It's just like a woman.

602
00:51:19,364 --> 00:51:23,659
Easy, everything you
touch turns to rigor mortis.

603
00:51:25,172 --> 00:51:29,016
With your strength I bet you can
take that radiator and just pull it up

604
00:51:29,017 --> 00:51:32,100
and play it like an accordion.
Wouldn't that be fun?

605
00:51:32,101 --> 00:51:35,905
You could even take those bars
and just bend them apart, ah?

606
00:51:35,906 --> 00:51:40,714
I don't like to brag
Go ahead and brag.

607
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:41,881
Alright.

608
00:51:50,806 --> 00:51:53,369
That's great Willie. Gee you're strong.

609
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:56,132
You want I should tear up the radiator.

610
00:51:56,133 --> 00:51:59,457
No, that's ok, you've done enough,
you're wonderful.

611
00:51:59,458 --> 00:52:03,863
You're solid spinach. You're great,
I'll buy you a rabbit late.

612
00:52:03,864 --> 00:52:07,999
Thanks very much.
I'll be seeing you chummy.

613
00:52:28,297 --> 00:52:30,428
It got to be neat, you know.

614
00:52:47,402 --> 00:52:50,057
Did you hear that?
Yes.

615
00:52:50,807 --> 00:52:53,701
Big detective outsmarted by an imbecile.

616
00:52:54,172 --> 00:52:57,535
We've got to get out of here.
In two hours though.

617
00:52:57,536 --> 00:52:59,538
We're caught like rats in a trap.

618
00:52:59,539 --> 00:53:04,507
At least we're a boy-rat and a girl-rat.

619
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,451
Here's your dinner.
Thank you.

620
00:53:18,725 --> 00:53:20,969
No use struggling.

621
00:53:28,218 --> 00:53:30,900
See, I told you there was no use struggling.
Come on.

622
00:53:30,901 --> 00:53:32,587
No, get the keys.

623
00:53:34,226 --> 00:53:36,388
I'll be your nurse, patient.

624
00:53:36,389 --> 00:53:38,918
Great.
This is where I get the new clothes.

625
00:53:40,915 --> 00:53:43,597
We better split up when we get
downstairs and meet at my car.

626
00:53:43,598 --> 00:53:47,442
You can't miss it it's a great convertible
with a horn that goes "dadadada"

627
00:53:47,443 --> 00:53:49,045
it's a conservative model.

628
00:53:49,046 --> 00:53:52,449
Yes, but suppose they took the keys.
Don't need them, there's a trick you can do

629
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:53,658
with the wires.

630
00:54:05,348 --> 00:54:07,389
Somebody's coming.
Act like a nurse.

631
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:08,882
Act like a patient.

632
00:54:12,637 --> 00:54:16,534
There, there.
Nurse?

633
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,291
Phenobarbitol.

634
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:24,493
I think I do this too well.
Come on.

635
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:28,900
Wait a minute, I see what's in here.

636
00:54:30,421 --> 00:54:33,104
There's nothing here but this
mangy old piece of moth paste.

637
00:54:33,105 --> 00:54:35,680
It's mine.
Yours? Pretty, isn't it.

638
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:38,480
We can't use this. Come on.

639
00:54:39,113 --> 00:54:41,403
When we get to the door
we'll make a break forward.

640
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:44,731
Hi you stranger.

641
00:54:46,523 --> 00:54:48,847
How do you do my dear?

642
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:53,895
Going around with a pretty nurse I see,
you'll be getting out of here in no time.

643
00:54:56,176 --> 00:54:57,623
He's one of us.

644
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:03,509
How many branches does
our Government consist of?

645
00:55:04,347 --> 00:55:07,720
Our Government consists
of three branches.

646
00:55:08,272 --> 00:55:12,727
What are the three branches
of our Government?

647
00:55:14,321 --> 00:55:18,411
The three branches of our Government are...

648
00:55:18,887 --> 00:55:22,977
The legislative, the executive
and the judiciary.

649
00:55:24,494 --> 00:55:29,462
What does the legislative branch of our
Government do?

650
00:55:33,306 --> 00:55:35,789
It makes the laws.

651
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:40,154
What does the executive branch of our
Government do?

652
00:55:40,155 --> 00:55:42,918
It carries out the law.

653
00:55:42,919 --> 00:55:44,811
Sneaking out, stranger?

654
00:55:46,684 --> 00:55:47,926
It's you.

655
00:55:49,688 --> 00:55:50,657
Practicing again.

656
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:52,183
Don't leave me.

657
00:55:52,652 --> 00:55:54,224
How delightful.

658
00:55:55,096 --> 00:55:58,309
Wonderful.
Wait a minute.

659
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:01,223
Take it easy, cuddles.
Cuddles?

660
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:02,910
Look I was j...

661
00:56:03,787 --> 00:56:06,750
Marvelous!
Come here you coward.

662
00:56:06,751 --> 00:56:08,802
Look you could get a trouble...

663
00:56:09,475 --> 00:56:12,688
Why you dirty rat!

664
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,165
Nothing personal.

665
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:20,891
Great.
Come here, come here...

666
00:56:26,378 --> 00:56:29,113
Why, You stupid, you...

667
00:56:30,824 --> 00:56:32,271
Come on, let's...

668
00:56:36,792 --> 00:56:38,877
Willie, you go that way.

669
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:43,729
Hey, I don't see him.

670
00:56:46,044 --> 00:56:48,813
Hang out Willie, let's search the woods.

671
00:56:54,896 --> 00:56:56,742
Friend.

672
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:01,184
How did you get rid of them?
You just couldn't stand the details baby.

673
00:57:01,185 --> 00:57:03,634
I just hope I didn't
strike them too hard.

674
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:08,282
It's a good thing we're downhill.
I'll release the brake.

675
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,163
What are you doing now?
I'll show you the trick with the wires.

676
00:57:15,164 --> 00:57:17,055
We don't need the key.

677
00:57:33,548 --> 00:57:35,873
What the time to hit the jackpot.

678
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:52,214
You do better with your knife.
Shut up.

679
00:57:53,375 --> 00:57:56,907
What happened? Hey, I'm driving.

680
00:57:57,661 --> 00:58:00,509
I'll take it through here it gets a little rough.
Thanks.

681
00:58:02,668 --> 00:58:05,310
As soon as we get to the city
we'll call Mr Collins.

682
00:58:05,311 --> 00:58:07,994
Or better yet we go to your office
and get the map and then we'll go...

683
00:58:07,995 --> 00:58:09,836
Hold it.
What's the matter?

684
00:58:09,837 --> 00:58:12,890
I got news for you Miss Montay
I'm bowing out.

685
00:58:12,962 --> 00:58:15,936
But Sam you can't.
I'm forcing myself.

686
00:58:16,006 --> 00:58:18,208
This kind of life is too
rich for my blood.

687
00:58:18,209 --> 00:58:22,053
The little I've got left.
I'll get you the map and then we'll call it quits.

688
00:58:22,054 --> 00:58:26,499
Sorry Mr McCloud. Are you always afraid
of old men with phoney sort of accent?

689
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:31,507
What do I owe you? All I know is you came
into my office with a phoney Steiner ring

690
00:58:31,867 --> 00:58:34,397
Now I ain't got the ring
and I'm stuck with the story.

691
00:58:35,632 --> 00:58:38,115
Put this top up.
It's going to rain.

692
00:58:38,116 --> 00:58:40,280
It never rains at this time of the year.

693
00:58:44,965 --> 00:58:45,967
Orange juice.

694
00:58:47,128 --> 00:58:50,932
Here we are.
Ronnie Jackson, photographer for babies?

695
00:58:50,933 --> 00:58:52,334
That's me.

696
00:58:52,335 --> 00:58:56,665
Where's Sam McCloud?
He's out of town. A top break for all of us.

697
00:58:57,181 --> 00:59:01,025
So you've been playing detective.
Yeah but I'm through playing sister.

698
00:59:01,026 --> 00:59:04,991
The last 24 I've been knocked down,
shattered, beaten up, knocked down again

699
00:59:04,992 --> 00:59:06,473
and put through the ringer.

700
00:59:06,474 --> 00:59:10,438
And if I'm still alive it's only because the
insurance company doesn't want to give up.

701
00:59:10,439 --> 00:59:12,570
They're afraid I would break them.

702
00:59:14,044 --> 00:59:18,769
Here's your map miss Montay.
Right water cooler but wrong office.

703
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:20,012
Good bye.

704
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:26,744
Alright. Goodbye Sam.
I mean Mr Jackson.

705
00:59:28,303 --> 00:59:33,271
Bye. And I don't mean see you later.
So long sister.

706
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:49,731
Wait a minute, you can't go out like that,
you're soaked to the skin.

707
00:59:49,732 --> 00:59:52,375
I'll manage.
Hold steady.

708
00:59:52,376 --> 00:59:55,144
Why do women always act like women.

709
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:57,421
Here a few things.
Who's things?

710
00:59:57,422 --> 00:59:59,234
Mine, pick out what you need.

711
00:59:59,585 --> 01:00:02,629
The ones with the lace are still at the laundry.
May I change...

712
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:05,638
No, it's my room.
Over here behind the screen.

713
01:00:06,034 --> 01:00:08,597
You're not a detective but you act like one.

714
01:00:08,598 --> 01:00:11,127
I ain't exactly a cream puff sister.

715
01:00:14,445 --> 01:00:17,020
Guy could use water wings in this business.

716
01:00:19,332 --> 01:00:24,339
Ronnie, I just want you to know
I'm not really angry with you.

717
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:29,235
Why not?
I'm grateful for all you've done for me.

718
01:00:29,305 --> 01:00:33,236
Even if you were McCloud you
couldn't have accomplished more.

719
01:00:34,312 --> 01:00:37,355
Don't rain up on me.
From now on I'm going to stick

720
01:00:37,356 --> 01:00:40,091
to watch the birdie and
leave the checks alone.

721
01:00:43,324 --> 01:00:45,687
I think you're a very brave man.

722
01:00:45,688 --> 01:00:48,171
I know a sniveling coward when I see one.

723
01:00:49,252 --> 01:00:50,665
Hi you snivel.

724
01:00:51,095 --> 01:00:54,258
But I've no one else to turn to,
won't you help me?

725
01:00:54,259 --> 01:00:54,988
No.

726
01:00:56,262 --> 01:00:59,345
Please.
No you don't. What kind of a sucker

727
01:00:59,346 --> 01:01:03,831
do you take me for? Just because
you're a girl and I'm a boy and you

728
01:01:03,832 --> 01:01:08,157
throw those big blue eyes at me
and let me put my arms around you

729
01:01:08,158 --> 01:01:10,800
and you let me hold you close
even closer

730
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:13,810
you think you can get me
to do anything you want.

731
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:18,823
What do you want baby?

732
01:01:19,013 --> 01:01:22,704
Darling, the first thing we got to do...
We're doing it.

733
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:29,387
We've got to find James Collins.
Collins... yes. No, we got to get out of here

734
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:34,913
this is the first place those characters will
look. I don't want that cuddles playing

735
01:01:34,914 --> 01:01:36,916
Mumley pig on my throat.
Take those off.

736
01:01:36,917 --> 01:01:39,399
What?
I mean... put this on.

737
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,602
I better roll these up first.

738
01:01:41,603 --> 01:01:43,734
Where's my hat?

739
01:01:49,213 --> 01:01:51,936
It's you Mrs Fong.
Mr Jackson, stop pushing me.

740
01:01:51,937 --> 01:01:55,661
I'm sorry. Hurry.
I'm very disappointed in you.

741
01:01:55,662 --> 01:01:59,066
You teak the picture of sonny
smiling for the first time in his life.

742
01:01:59,067 --> 01:02:01,749
And then you give me the wrong...
Don't worry about things Mrs Fong

743
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:03,792
I'll give you your money back.
Hurry.

744
01:02:03,793 --> 01:02:06,355
I don't want my money back
I want the picture of sonny smiling

745
01:02:06,356 --> 01:02:08,361
for the first time in his life.

746
01:02:10,802 --> 01:02:13,445
Here they come. Hurry up.

747
01:02:13,446 --> 01:02:15,895
Come on, let's go or we'll stay here.

748
01:02:17,011 --> 01:02:19,780
Don't worry about that
I'll send you a check.

749
01:02:21,657 --> 01:02:24,312
But you gave me the wrong negative.

750
01:02:34,314 --> 01:02:37,846
"Our next move is to
contact Mr James Collins.

751
01:02:37,919 --> 01:02:41,923
His secretary said he had a date that
night at a spot called the "Le Poulet D'Or"

752
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:45,809
From here in we had no worries
Montague and his cute little playmates

753
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:49,093
they were washed up,
threw, lost in the shuffle.

754
01:02:49,094 --> 01:02:53,819
"Poulet D'Or" was our next stop, but we
didn't look exactly like café society

755
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:56,703
Sol blew the bankroll and
rented a tuxedo for myself

756
01:02:56,704 --> 01:03:00,829
and an evening gown for Carlotta.
Boy did she stack up.

757
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:03,553
I guess she only get out of the thing
watch you poor thing do it.

758
01:03:03,554 --> 01:03:07,718
An hour later we're at the "Poulet D'Or",
one of those real swanky cafés

759
01:03:07,719 --> 01:03:09,486
where they eat mink for breakfast.

760
01:03:16,291 --> 01:03:19,025
Mr Whitebow has been waiting.

761
01:03:19,856 --> 01:03:24,663
Mr Collins' table, he's expecting us.
Yes, he's right there by the window.

762
01:03:28,307 --> 01:03:32,231
Yes, there he is.
This way please.

763
01:03:32,232 --> 01:03:38,247
Just a minute bud. Tell that blonde at
that table she's wanted on the phone.

764
01:03:39,202 --> 01:03:42,130
Pronto.
Certainly, sir.

765
01:03:44,729 --> 01:03:49,503
Pardon me, you're wanted on the phone miss.
If you'll excuse me.

766
01:03:51,378 --> 01:03:53,460
Mr Collins, we'd like to
speak to you for a while.

767
01:03:53,461 --> 01:03:56,864
I don't believe I've had the...
Sit down, start talking baby.

768
01:03:56,865 --> 01:04:01,110
My name is Carlotta Montay,
my uncle is baron Montay.

769
01:04:01,111 --> 01:04:05,716
Baron Montay?
I don't think I ever...

770
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:07,848
My uncle told us to
get in touch with you.

771
01:04:10,844 --> 01:04:15,850
I'm sorry, I'm afraid you got the wrong man.
Waiter, my check please.

772
01:04:15,851 --> 01:04:18,665
Does this map mean anything to you?

773
01:04:27,707 --> 01:04:29,393
Where is the baron?

774
01:04:30,791 --> 01:04:34,675
Hanry! The waiter said you
had a phone call for me.

775
01:04:34,676 --> 01:04:35,804
I will check it for you, madame.

776
01:04:36,199 --> 01:04:39,286
The baron had an appointment this
Wednesday afternoon in Washington.

777
01:04:39,763 --> 01:04:41,734
In his office, at the Pilgrim Hotel.

778
01:04:42,487 --> 01:04:44,649
Someone must keep that appointment.

779
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:47,133
Someone will but it won't be
the right baron Montay.

780
01:04:47,454 --> 01:04:50,457
Right, our first move
is to get the local police.

781
01:04:50,458 --> 01:04:52,580
No, you stay here Miss Montay.

782
01:04:52,581 --> 01:04:55,155
These men are killers.
Then I'll stay here too.

783
01:04:55,505 --> 01:04:57,026
Come on.
Ok.

784
01:04:57,027 --> 01:04:59,108
If we're not back in forty-five
minutes call the police.

785
01:04:59,109 --> 01:05:00,762
All of them. Check.

786
01:05:02,955 --> 01:05:05,277
The tenth precinct police station
is the closest.

787
01:05:05,278 --> 01:05:08,000
Good, we'll call from there.
But the soonest we get this

788
01:05:08,001 --> 01:05:10,086
in the hands of
the FBI the better.

789
01:05:12,167 --> 01:05:14,249
Baron Montay's appointment
in Washington Wednesday

790
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:15,936
was with the State department

791
01:05:16,733 --> 01:05:21,739
This is dynamite. Look Mr Collins,
how do you figure in this deal?

792
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:26,747
I'm a geologist. I worked with baron Montay
in Sandimas in fact I drew this map for him.

793
01:05:26,907 --> 01:05:30,120
It shows the location of a
great deposit of cryolite.

794
01:05:30,872 --> 01:05:33,686
I don't see anything.
It's in code.

795
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:37,640
Yesterday morning I received a phone call,
the voice exactly like baron Montay's

796
01:05:37,641 --> 01:05:40,644
said that there had
been a change in plans

797
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:43,568
that the land was no longer for sale.
Do you realise what that means?

798
01:05:43,569 --> 01:05:44,970
Not exactly.

799
01:05:44,971 --> 01:05:48,948
Means that somebody, some other
governments perhaps, are after that cryolite.

800
01:05:53,303 --> 01:05:56,037
Cryolite? We can't let them get it.

801
01:05:57,388 --> 01:05:58,629
What's cryolite?

802
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:04,441
It's an ore. Containing crypto-bar.
Crypto-bar? We can't let them get that!

803
01:06:04,918 --> 01:06:08,484
What's crypto-bar?
The source of uranium.

804
01:06:08,924 --> 01:06:13,572
Uranium! Now I got you,
I read Buck Rogers, too.

805
01:06:18,537 --> 01:06:20,986
Must be that right front. Come on.

806
01:06:23,223 --> 01:06:25,274
I had a hunch this thing's was
much bigger than it looks.

807
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:33,598
That's funny, it's ok.
Come on.

808
01:06:42,609 --> 01:06:45,696
Mr Collins, we're here.

809
01:06:49,178 --> 01:06:52,072
Blood. And it ain't mine, it's red.

810
01:06:52,823 --> 01:06:56,469
Keep cool Ronnie. The murder weapon.

811
01:06:58,070 --> 01:07:00,839
Find the owner of this gun
and you got the killer.

812
01:07:01,515 --> 01:07:03,725
It's mine.
My god!

813
01:07:06,001 --> 01:07:08,484
It's got my fingerprints on it.

814
01:07:09,806 --> 01:07:13,257
I don't care if she has got a girlfriend
I'm going home and hit the hay.

815
01:07:13,771 --> 01:07:17,303
I just don't go for any blind dates
I'd rather be caught dead.

816
01:07:19,098 --> 01:07:21,388
Ok call her up.

817
01:07:30,073 --> 01:07:32,204
Ehi you.
Who me?

818
01:07:32,877 --> 01:07:36,761
You don't expect to get away with this?
I'll tell you I didn't do it.

819
01:07:36,762 --> 01:07:41,251
Of course you didn't do it. This
fire-hydrant just snaked up on you, ah?

820
01:07:41,729 --> 01:07:44,892
Oh that!
Let me see your driver's license.

821
01:07:44,893 --> 01:07:48,220
You got me all wrong officer,
this isn't my car.

822
01:07:48,338 --> 01:07:51,261
Isn't eh?
I don't drive, I drink a lot and get nosebleed.

823
01:07:51,262 --> 01:07:54,024
What are doing here?
I was just cleaning.

824
01:07:54,025 --> 01:07:56,388
Trying to roll that drunk?
No, I wouldn't think of it.

825
01:07:56,389 --> 01:08:00,160
How could I roll him. Besides some
of my best friends are drunks.

826
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:06,042
I was just... well I got to go now, it's been fun.
(Not too fast looks suspicious.)

827
01:08:06,162 --> 01:08:09,245
So long, it's been fun.
(Stop saying that.)

828
01:08:09,246 --> 01:08:12,538
Goodbye now, I got to run now.

829
01:08:14,213 --> 01:08:15,545
Hi fellow.

830
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:21,347
Stop or I shoot.

831
01:08:35,641 --> 01:08:39,165
Well, who takes care of him,
he's a real help to us that boy.

832
01:08:39,166 --> 01:08:43,575
What about the girl?
Carlotta is no problem, we have the map.

833
01:08:47,177 --> 01:08:50,380
"When I told Carlotta they'd rapped out
Collins it was quite a blow.

834
01:08:50,381 --> 01:08:52,263
But the kid bounced back like a rubber ball.

835
01:08:52,264 --> 01:08:56,194
A nice soft rubber ball. Too bad I
wasn't in the mood to play catch.

836
01:08:56,630 --> 01:09:00,955
I was in for keeps now:
Ronnie Jackson wanted for murder.

837
01:09:00,956 --> 01:09:04,760
If we were going to save the doll's
uncle and Mrs Jackson's boy Ronnie

838
01:09:04,761 --> 01:09:06,682
we had to get something
about that gang

839
01:09:06,683 --> 01:09:09,206
that meant our next stop
had to be Washington.

840
01:09:09,207 --> 01:09:12,210
But we needed dosh to get there and
little Carlotta came through.

841
01:09:12,211 --> 01:09:15,374
We got the last two seats
on a plane and by midnight

842
01:09:15,375 --> 01:09:17,617
we were playing tag
with the Rockies.

843
01:09:17,618 --> 01:09:21,262
Carlotta was very sweet.
She looked after me like a mother.

844
01:09:21,263 --> 01:09:23,712
I guess she wanted to make
sure I didn't get away.

845
01:09:23,786 --> 01:09:26,874
And for the skies I was wearing
a ten o'clock shadow

846
01:09:26,951 --> 01:09:30,915
I had to play it cagy. The only thing
that bothered me was the altitude.

847
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:34,840
I knew it would get me, I get airsick
when I step on a thick carpet.

848
01:09:34,841 --> 01:09:39,934
We hit Washington about noon the next day
and we grabbed a cab for the Pilgrim Hotel.

849
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:43,372
This was the end the ride. The payoff

850
01:09:43,373 --> 01:09:48,386
Ronnie Jackson vs mint julep Montague.
My brain pitted against his.

851
01:09:49,541 --> 01:09:51,546
He had the brain and I had the pit.

852
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:01,476
Suppose they haven't got a
room in my uncle's suite?

853
01:10:01,477 --> 01:10:03,960
You just toss that smile on him
and he'll give us a joint.

854
01:10:03,961 --> 01:10:06,365
Thanks, Ronnie. Look.

855
01:10:09,047 --> 01:10:11,178
It's nice to see you again, baron.
Thank you.

856
01:10:14,895 --> 01:10:17,458
I guess old short brain
joins him later.

857
01:10:17,459 --> 01:10:19,701
I'll see about that room.

858
01:10:19,702 --> 01:10:22,264
We would like to talk to you about...
One momento please.

859
01:10:22,265 --> 01:10:24,347
Can you tell me the number
of baron Montay's suite?

860
01:10:24,348 --> 01:10:29,316
Sorry, he's out of town.
I'm Mr Dawson of the State Department.

861
01:10:30,436 --> 01:10:34,572
He's expecting you. Suite 14 C.
Thank you.

862
01:10:37,205 --> 01:10:39,688
We'd like a room, something
on the 14th floor.

863
01:10:39,689 --> 01:10:40,609
Sorry we haven't a thing.

864
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:42,732
What about those rooms for
Hennessey and McCarthy?

865
01:10:42,733 --> 01:10:44,574
And Kelly?
And Schultz?

866
01:10:44,575 --> 01:10:47,150
Oh yes, will you please register?

867
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:49,942
I thought you said you
didn't have a room.

868
01:10:49,943 --> 01:10:52,105
Well, you see, if you were
with the convention I could...

869
01:10:52,106 --> 01:10:54,748
Sure we are with the convention.

870
01:10:54,749 --> 01:10:58,122
You certainly don't look like a detective.

871
01:11:04,963 --> 01:11:08,814
I'm not exactly a detective,
I'm more of a stool pidgeon.

872
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:12,984
There at the other hotel...
Look!

873
01:11:18,461 --> 01:11:23,429
We must be off, cheerio, pit pit,
top holding on... Come, come.

874
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:28,874
We mustn't be late for tea.
I hate soggy crumpets, you know.

875
01:11:28,875 --> 01:11:30,801
So do I.
Stiff up bud.

876
01:11:33,642 --> 01:11:36,616
Read all about it.
Get your latest.

877
01:11:39,049 --> 01:11:41,134
Police captured killer.

878
01:11:42,253 --> 01:11:44,856
They got me.
New York gangster jailed.

879
01:11:44,857 --> 01:11:47,820
It's a New York murder
he's yelling about.

880
01:11:47,821 --> 01:11:50,225
Sure, I'm just a San Francisco murderer.

881
01:11:51,145 --> 01:11:52,226
Don't know how much
more of this I can take.

882
01:11:52,227 --> 01:11:54,789
You've had me in hot water so long
I feel like a tea-bag.

883
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:56,672
Why don't you quit,
I can take it from here.

884
01:11:56,673 --> 01:11:59,886
Sure enough that you got me over a barrel,
now that I'm wanted for murder.

885
01:12:00,478 --> 01:12:03,372
For murder. You want me to quit?
Let me...

886
01:12:07,527 --> 01:12:09,851
Did you hear that bell ringing?
What bell?

887
01:12:10,131 --> 01:12:12,614
They just rang for ice water at 14 C.

888
01:12:12,854 --> 01:12:17,389
And who do you think is going to bring
it up? Me. I'm a chambermaid.

889
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,723
Mr Dawson. Boy, bring it back!

890
01:12:34,724 --> 01:12:36,205
I want to talk to you.

891
01:12:36,206 --> 01:12:39,180
Which way?
To the right major Montague.

892
01:12:41,053 --> 01:12:43,775
Hey boy, give me a hand with these bags.

893
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:46,939
This is ice water. There's a blonde
in 14A that's on fire. I check.

894
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:50,664
Stop that comedy and get these bags.
It's an emergency, she says...

895
01:12:50,665 --> 01:12:53,354
Come on.
Ok,just let me drop this.

896
01:12:56,273 --> 01:12:59,725
Don't push me around.
My dues are paid too.

897
01:13:00,238 --> 01:13:02,050
Alright, Tony?

898
01:13:06,006 --> 01:13:07,419
Let's go.

899
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:15,020
Oh boy, you, that portfolio...
The office is in there, Simon.

900
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:18,954
Put the bags in that room
and the portfolio in the office.

901
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:27,355
Baron, was it easy?
I've known Mr Dawson beautifully.

902
01:13:29,117 --> 01:13:31,239
Nice having you again
with us baron Montay.

903
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,931
Will you be in Washington long?
Not long, a few days perhaps.

904
01:13:35,406 --> 01:13:39,496
Let me tell you about Dawson.
Not now, wait till we're alone.

905
01:13:39,772 --> 01:13:43,816
Would you like me to open the window?
No, it's quite alright, thank you.

906
01:13:43,817 --> 01:13:47,030
Yes baron. Boy.

907
01:13:51,067 --> 01:13:53,995
Boy.
Coming.

908
01:13:56,514 --> 01:13:59,728
Would that be all sir?
That's all thank you.

909
01:13:59,879 --> 01:14:03,012
And the other boy?
Just a minute young man.

910
01:14:06,808 --> 01:14:08,700
Give this to your friend.
Thank you sir.

911
01:14:16,301 --> 01:14:17,589
Ok sucker.

912
01:14:28,638 --> 01:14:30,882
You'd have been proud of me I tell you.

913
01:14:31,401 --> 01:14:34,249
Not Kismet. He's never
proud of anybody.

914
01:15:00,761 --> 01:15:05,768
Well?
The baron is a stubborn old man.

915
01:15:06,128 --> 01:15:11,135
He still hasn't talked, he pretends
he doesn't know the code.

916
01:15:11,656 --> 01:15:13,228
Give me that.

917
01:15:24,633 --> 01:15:27,527
Well, give it in chummy.

918
01:15:27,958 --> 01:15:31,361
Look Willie, we're friends, pals, remember?

919
01:15:31,362 --> 01:15:35,246
Sure. I like you. Let's go tell
the fellows you're here.

920
01:15:35,247 --> 01:15:38,411
No, Willie. They'll ruin everything.
We're friends, let's be alone.

921
01:15:38,412 --> 01:15:41,335
Here, have some walnuts.
Are them yours?

922
01:15:41,336 --> 01:15:44,310
Slip this into your pocket.
Gee, thanks.

923
01:15:45,021 --> 01:15:50,398
Have some more.
I like walnuts better than almost anything.

924
01:15:50,869 --> 01:15:55,875
Except coconuts. I hate them.
They don't get in here.

925
01:15:56,917 --> 01:16:01,690
And they will soon.
Just forget that you ever saw me.

926
01:16:01,803 --> 01:16:06,337
I will bring you some peachy nuts, you can
crack them with your eyelids. More fun.

927
01:16:09,614 --> 01:16:11,745
You're a pal.

928
01:16:38,172 --> 01:16:43,140
You know who I've just seen?
That's the part that's in code.

929
01:16:45,462 --> 01:16:48,835
Go ahead. What are you doing?
Cracking nuts.

930
01:16:49,027 --> 01:16:51,830
Guess who gave it to me.
Sit down.

931
01:16:51,831 --> 01:16:54,155
He was right...
Stop interrupting.

932
01:16:54,354 --> 01:16:56,724
But I just wanted...
Shut up.

933
01:16:56,878 --> 01:17:00,091
That ain't no nice way to talk to...

934
01:17:02,525 --> 01:17:04,610
Alright, I'll keep quiet.

935
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:11,507
Any luck?

936
01:17:13,099 --> 01:17:16,143
Thought you looked a little thin.
Anything in the portfolio?

937
01:17:16,144 --> 01:17:19,387
Just this, they're too smart
to put anything on paper.

938
01:17:19,388 --> 01:17:23,072
I'd like to shoot it up on them
but it's so messy.

939
01:17:23,073 --> 01:17:25,158
I've looked into the filing cabinet.

940
01:17:25,556 --> 01:17:28,086
We got to get something out
baby or we're dead ducks.

941
01:17:29,201 --> 01:17:31,731
"We got to get something out
baby or we're dead ducks."

942
01:17:31,965 --> 01:17:33,412
I said that.

943
01:17:37,412 --> 01:17:39,134
What is it?
That's a recording machine

944
01:17:39,135 --> 01:17:40,535
repeats what you say.

945
01:17:40,536 --> 01:17:42,979
For a guy too fat to hold
his secretary in his lap.

946
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:45,262
Do you know how to work it?
Sure, you just speak into this mike

947
01:17:45,263 --> 01:17:46,303
and make a record.

948
01:17:46,304 --> 01:17:47,865
That's it.
That's what?

949
01:17:47,866 --> 01:17:50,709
You work the machine
I get them to talk.

950
01:17:50,710 --> 01:17:53,473
This is one of the best
ideas I ever had.

951
01:17:53,474 --> 01:17:56,048
Marvelous what you can
do when you're thinking.

952
01:17:56,638 --> 01:17:58,769
Ok, lead them in.

953
01:18:03,608 --> 01:18:06,980
What was that?
I don't know it came from here.

954
01:18:20,711 --> 01:18:24,715
Well, Carlotta. A chambermaid, now?

955
01:18:24,716 --> 01:18:27,479
You see she's dangerous
we've got to get rid of her.

956
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:30,082
Let her go Kismet.
We don't want no trouble here.

957
01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:34,288
That's no trouble. I put her in a trunk and
send her to my brother in California.

958
01:18:34,289 --> 01:18:38,823
I said let her go. Alright boys
we will handle this.

959
01:18:39,536 --> 01:18:42,139
Sit down Carlotta.

960
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:46,985
Whatever happened to your friend,
what was his name, Mr Jackson?

961
01:18:46,986 --> 01:18:51,591
That fool, that imbecile, he never
knew when to keep his mouth shut.

962
01:18:51,592 --> 01:18:56,241
You were too smart for him.
Now I'm alone and...

963
01:18:56,319 --> 01:18:58,973
too weak to fight any longer.

964
01:18:59,843 --> 01:19:02,846
There's really nothing
to fight about honey.

965
01:19:02,847 --> 01:19:04,818
I'll show you what I mean.

966
01:19:05,171 --> 01:19:08,622
I once made you a generous
offer concerning this

967
01:19:09,937 --> 01:19:13,024
Yeah, the map.

968
01:19:15,104 --> 01:19:17,189
Now I'm repeating that offer.

969
01:19:17,507 --> 01:19:20,435
There seems to be something missing here.
The code.

970
01:19:20,752 --> 01:19:25,758
You get me the code to the uranium deposits
in Sandimas and I'll let you both go.

971
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:29,162
Do you mean my uncle and me?
Yes.

972
01:19:29,163 --> 01:19:32,695
I see.
Otherwise?

973
01:19:33,088 --> 01:19:35,823
You know what we did to Mr Collins.

974
01:19:36,212 --> 01:19:39,336
What do you mean we? I did.

975
01:19:39,337 --> 01:19:42,860
Always belittle me.
When I do a job I do it.

976
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:47,106
I don't think we ought to waste
time arguing between ourselves, Kismet.

977
01:19:47,107 --> 01:19:48,679
Alright.

978
01:19:49,030 --> 01:19:53,997
Well I'll get to think it over for a minute
it's a very big decision.

979
01:19:54,077 --> 01:19:57,480
I don't like to be kept waiting girl.
No we don't.

980
01:19:57,481 --> 01:19:59,008
Did you hear me Carlotta?

981
01:20:02,888 --> 01:20:06,332
Did you really kill Mr Collins?
Who do you think did it?

982
01:20:06,333 --> 01:20:09,496
That baby photographer?
That phoney detective?

983
01:20:09,497 --> 01:20:14,504
How do you like that? Such a neat job
and artistic. She thinks an amateur did it.

984
01:20:15,626 --> 01:20:19,270
Yes, stop taking pause.
I'm not taking any pause.

985
01:20:19,271 --> 01:20:20,877
I'm still waiting, Carlotta.

986
01:20:22,235 --> 01:20:23,807
Did you hear me?

987
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:29,043
Kismet, I can't believe that
you killed Mr Collins.

988
01:20:29,044 --> 01:20:34,049
But I did, I killed him!
How often do I have to say it!

989
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:36,739
That does it, stick them up.

990
01:20:39,938 --> 01:20:42,501
Easy Cuddles, one move
and you're a dead midget.

991
01:20:42,502 --> 01:20:46,386
Didn't recognise me? Give me
that map, come here baby

992
01:20:46,387 --> 01:20:50,392
Or you're going to be in a crossfire.
Now get your friends in here.

993
01:20:50,393 --> 01:20:54,036
Hurry up or I'll fill you so full of holes
you'll look like a fat clarinette.

994
01:20:54,037 --> 01:20:56,640
Come on get them in here.
Get back there.

995
01:20:56,641 --> 01:21:02,098
Make it snappy. Nice work baby.
Alright boys, you can come in now.

996
01:21:04,652 --> 01:21:07,695
Come on. Easy enough fellows.

997
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:10,539
I've got a bullet in here for each of you.
And one left over

998
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:12,101
in case I can still hear breathing.

999
01:21:12,102 --> 01:21:17,108
You know those dicks downstairs, them
I'm giving a little party at 14 C. Hurry.

1000
01:21:17,109 --> 01:21:21,273
Will you be alright?
Alright this is my type of work.

1001
01:21:21,274 --> 01:21:24,478
Line up against the wall.
Hurry up I got you all covered.

1002
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:26,245
Back up all of you.

1003
01:21:32,329 --> 01:21:34,380
Ok, then I'll back up.

1004
01:21:34,893 --> 01:21:39,222
Come on fellows, be sensible.
The least you can do is put your hands up.

1005
01:21:41,822 --> 01:21:43,553
Why didn't I think of that before?

1006
01:21:45,347 --> 01:21:48,109
See this record? It's a little swing number.

1007
01:21:48,110 --> 01:21:50,392
And you guys are going
to do the swinging.

1008
01:21:50,393 --> 01:21:53,316
Willie.
What up with Willie?

1009
01:21:53,317 --> 01:21:56,883
Give it to me chummy.
Walnuts? I don't want to hurt you.

1010
01:21:58,885 --> 01:22:02,132
Why you coward? Using you feet, eh?

1011
01:22:03,291 --> 01:22:06,014
Sorry.
Get after him. Get that record.

1012
01:22:06,015 --> 01:22:08,783
Get after him.
Get that record.

1013
01:22:09,539 --> 01:22:14,507
Look. You come one step closer and I'll
break this record into a thousand pieces.

1014
01:22:15,307 --> 01:22:17,309
Wait a minute, who's side am I on?

1015
01:22:17,310 --> 01:22:21,114
Please fellows, I can't go any higher
of the ceiling. I blow my top.

1016
01:22:21,115 --> 01:22:22,556
Get him down and get the record.

1017
01:22:22,557 --> 01:22:25,531
No reachy nuts?
Give it to me chummy.

1018
01:22:28,725 --> 01:22:30,607
Ray Milland's been here.

1019
01:22:30,608 --> 01:22:33,137
Give it to me.
I hate to do this Willie.

1020
01:22:38,578 --> 01:22:40,106
What's going on in here?

1021
01:22:40,581 --> 01:22:44,906
I'm tenent Hennessey.
Tenent! Oh boy am I glad to see you.

1022
01:22:44,907 --> 01:22:47,994
Arrest that man he's a crook and
a murderer, they're all murderers.

1023
01:22:49,273 --> 01:22:50,874
Are you alright?
Yeah, thanks.

1024
01:22:50,875 --> 01:22:52,917
You got here just in time.
What is this?

1025
01:22:52,918 --> 01:22:55,049
The young fellow is a
little mixed up officer.

1026
01:22:55,481 --> 01:22:58,484
I want you all to meet Ronnie Jackson,
who's wanted by the State of California

1027
01:22:58,485 --> 01:23:00,487
for the murder of one James Collins.

1028
01:23:00,488 --> 01:23:04,172
Just a minute, you listen to that record
and you'll see who killed James Collins.

1029
01:23:04,173 --> 01:23:08,498
Get the record mill-plate...
Lock the door!

1030
01:23:08,499 --> 01:23:10,310
Come, watch, listen to this, come here.

1031
01:23:10,421 --> 01:23:11,834
Stay here Jim.
Yes sir.

1032
01:23:15,428 --> 01:23:17,550
And that's not all I'll show
you I'll fix you characters.

1033
01:23:17,551 --> 01:23:20,274
This man is plumb crazy.
You hear this I'll send all these guys

1034
01:23:20,275 --> 01:23:21,796
to the cooler.
That's right Ronnie.

1035
01:23:21,797 --> 01:23:25,240
You may have a detective's convention but
I've been doing a little sloothing myself

1036
01:23:25,241 --> 01:23:27,851
in a modern way with a recording machine.
Need any help?

1037
01:23:27,925 --> 01:23:30,968
Give me that record. Deck away grammen.
Alright.

1038
01:23:30,969 --> 01:23:34,333
Gentlemen the record you're about to
hear not only clears me of a murder charge

1039
01:23:34,334 --> 01:23:37,016
but also exposes a tremendous
international conspiracy

1040
01:23:37,017 --> 01:23:41,871
which seeks to destroy civilization.
Listen.

1041
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:52,838
This isn't the record!
I've been framed.

1042
01:23:52,839 --> 01:23:54,480
They switched the records on me.

1043
01:23:54,481 --> 01:23:58,045
Wait a minute!
Before you take him away

1044
01:23:58,046 --> 01:24:01,730
in that pocket he has something
that belongs to me.

1045
01:24:01,731 --> 01:24:04,654
Give me that map,
it's not his it's baron Montay's.

1046
01:24:04,655 --> 01:24:06,785
Ask her, ask Carlotta.
Carlotta?

1047
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:18,083
Let's go killer.

1048
01:24:24,762 --> 01:24:27,885
That's about it.
You know the rest.

1049
01:24:27,886 --> 01:24:31,373
Quick trial, Carlotta never showing up.

1050
01:24:32,292 --> 01:24:35,300
Nice deal, women.

1051
01:24:37,619 --> 01:24:39,821
Reminds me.
We're late.

1052
01:24:39,822 --> 01:24:42,670
You're late, in about 5 minutes
I'll be the late Ronnie Jackson.

1053
01:24:42,826 --> 01:24:45,228
Come on.
We got tickets for this thing.

1054
01:24:45,229 --> 01:24:47,804
Fine, remember I'm doing
this without a rehearsal.

1055
01:24:50,236 --> 01:24:54,321
Too tight? Can you breathe?
What's the difference?

1056
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:57,409
What is this thing doc?
This is a stethoscope.

1057
01:24:59,368 --> 01:25:00,735
Still beating.

1058
01:25:02,412 --> 01:25:06,058
Hallo Warden.
Any news from the Government?

1059
01:25:07,219 --> 01:25:08,461
Open up.

1060
01:25:11,345 --> 01:25:12,917
Come here son.

1061
01:25:13,147 --> 01:25:15,039
You and I are going
to take a little walk.

1062
01:25:17,753 --> 01:25:20,967
Steady Jackson, you can take it.

1063
01:25:23,841 --> 01:25:25,494
Get some water.

1064
01:25:30,290 --> 01:25:32,660
Now they lay me down to sleep...

1065
01:25:34,776 --> 01:25:36,827
The've got you too?

1066
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:39,951
You look alive.
Yes.

1067
01:25:40,304 --> 01:25:42,914
Where are we?
Look.

1068
01:25:43,348 --> 01:25:47,793
Carlotta... You double cross why didn't you
come to my trial, where have you been?

1069
01:25:47,794 --> 01:25:51,724
Ronnie, you're free.
I'm free?

1070
01:25:54,443 --> 01:25:58,578
But how? Who did it?
You did, with your little keyhole camera.

1071
01:25:58,849 --> 01:26:02,700
Sam got this from Mr Fong.
He claims rest was just routine.

1072
01:26:02,774 --> 01:26:06,338
My keyhole shot of the phoney baron,
so you're the McCoy!

1073
01:26:06,339 --> 01:26:09,152
Young man, I want to thank
you for saving my life.

1074
01:26:09,223 --> 01:26:13,147
It was nothing. And I did it.
I knew I had it in me.

1075
01:26:13,148 --> 01:26:16,551
Maybe I was supposed to be a detective.

1076
01:26:16,552 --> 01:26:21,559
That's it, Ronnie Jackson the private eye.
No Ronnie, I think you better stick

1077
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:23,401
to taking baby pictures.

1078
01:26:23,402 --> 01:26:26,649
I forgot to tell the
executioner it's all off.

1079
01:26:27,007 --> 01:26:29,411
Harry, off.

1080
01:26:29,850 --> 01:26:31,776
Off

1081
01:26:43,028 --> 01:26:46,195
He'll take any kind of a part.
