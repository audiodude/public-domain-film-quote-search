1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:14,560
Sagebrush Trail

2
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,080
Ask for the Express,
the prisoner escapes.

3
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,600
Last edition,
the murderer escapes.

4
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,440
Brant gets the best of it!

5
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,280
This telegram indicates
that the fugitive is on this train.

6
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,000
- We'll check it out.
- Go ahead. Who is it?

7
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,360
John Brant, accused of murder.

8
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,160
I heard about it,
in the newspapers.

9
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,560
It's here!

10
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,000
He doesn't know the area,
we'll get him by going around the hill.

11
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,120
No trace of him.

12
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,640
Look at him.

13
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,120
We got it.

14
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,920
Let's head back to town,
the guys will drag the lake.

15
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,720
This time you've got me.

16
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,760
Get out of there,
I'm not the sheriff.

17
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,800
You're a smart guy...
you've got the nerve.

18
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,360
My boss needs a guy like you.

19
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,080
What is your name?

20
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,640
Smith, right?

21
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
All the guys like you
are called Smith.

22
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,360
Anyway, it doesn't matter, I'm Jones.

23
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,640
You're not well.

24
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,480
I'll take you to our hideout,
you'll meet the chief.

25
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,360
We're missing some guys.

26
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,160
I'm taking a guy to see our leader.

27
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,040
- Dick, I want you to meet a friend...
- Don't tell me,

28
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,520
let me guess.

29
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,840
- Smith, right?
- Right.

30
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,920
You can hold your own
an army here.

31
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,440
Through the underground, we can
make our way towards the mountain.

32
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,600
It's easy to run away.

33
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,320
Wait here a minute.

34
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,880
Now that it's here,
you have to deal with it.

35
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,880
We need a cook,
ours got banged up yesterday.

36
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,440
Smith, come clear the table.

37
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,680
Without me, guys.

38
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,920
I know where it came from, boss.

39
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,680
Your eyesight is failing, Jones.

40
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,840
No way.

41
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,320
Well done.

42
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,320
If he wants to stay a cook,
he should mind his own business.

43
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,960
1000 dollars reward
for any information

44
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,160
to capture John Brant.

45
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,720
Convicted by the State of Maryland

46
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,280
when he was found near the body
of George Wagner.

47
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,040
His apartment adjoined
of Mrs. Joseph Conlon.

48
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,880
Brant escaped on May 14.

49
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,440
He headed west.

50
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,280
That's the guy we lost yesterday.

51
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,760
I have to send a report.

52
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,280
It's a weird case.

53
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,520
The husband is also involved.

54
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,920
He's also hanging around.

55
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,240
I got a notice about him.

56
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,560
He could have saved Brant
if he had testified.

57
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,760
At least that's what they said
at the trial.

58
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,640
What would happen if they met?

59
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,920
Brant must be mad at him.

60
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,040
I've been on a roll.

61
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,800
Thanks for taking my side.

62
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,120
You didn't have to,
I won't forget.

63
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,800
I won't either.

64
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,000
Smith, go water the horses.

65
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,360
I'm a cook.

66
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,160
Do as you're told.

67
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,160
Just a minute,
I want to talk to you.

68
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,680
What do you know about this Smith?

69
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,200
His name is not Smith,
but he is solid

70
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,200
and he can be useful to us.

71
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,640
Besides, I know how to recognize
a good guy.

72
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,160
What if it was a sheriff?
They're good too.

73
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,800
You're worried...

74
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,960
I'll prove to you that he's legit.

75
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,040
Do you remember
our little project,

76
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,760
well, Smith and I
are going to take care of that.

77
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,640
A sheriff wouldn't do that.

78
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,640
All right, take it with you.

79
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,880
If you have any problems,
just hide out at Pete's.

80
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,800
Are you sure there's no sheriff?

81
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,880
Sure and certain,
they have other things to do.

82
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,560
Do you need anything?

83
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,120
- Surely.
- Do you have any rutabagas?

84
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,240
Of course I do.

85
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,240
Don't forget the purpose of the visit.

86
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,440
Tonight, leave the store lit up

87
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,320
and two men inside.
You are going to be robbed.

88
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,440
When is the next mail coming?

89
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,880
At three o'clock.

90
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,040
- Will he be on time?
- He's never late.

91
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,480
Do you want a ribbon?

92
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,160
That will be all.

93
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,640
Anything else?

94
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,200
Maybe for my friend.

95
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,760
What do you want?

96
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,040
The same thing.

97
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,240
The eggs.

98
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,640
You really don't want a ribbon?

99
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,800
Next time.

100
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,240
My friend pays for everything.

101
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,840
I'm sorry.

102
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,040
You want your syrup
for rheumatism.

103
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,120
- How do you know that?
- My little finger told me.

104
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,520
I got the wrong bottle.

105
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,520
No, this is the right one.

106
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,040
I don't know what
what I have today.

107
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,840
Look, Dad.

108
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,400
Do you think these two guys
have anything to do with it?

109
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,080
They didn't have time to write.

110
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,760
I stayed with them
the whole time.

111
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,240
I better tell the sheriff.

112
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,880
We'll be ready to welcome them,

113
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,160
but there will be no light.

114
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,280
No light.

115
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,920
This is bad.

116
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,720
Let me go first.

117
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,120
They were waiting for us.

118
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,640
- Go away, leave me here.
- I'll be all right.

119
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,840
Go hide at Pete's
and I'll come later.

120
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,640
These guys look familiar.

121
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,480
I wonder if...

122
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,960
No need to insist, it's too dark.

123
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,600
July 28th

124
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,080
August 10th

125
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,160
What's up, Pete?

126
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,080
The three-hour stagecoach
will carry the miners' pay.

127
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,760
I didn't expect so much.

128
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,800
My darling,
since I saw you yesterday...

129
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,960
And Smith?

130
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,440
I'm having trouble holding it.

131
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,600
- Where is it?
- In there.

132
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,720
How are you doing, partner?

133
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,760
I'm glad to be out of here.

134
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,600
You should wait a little while,

135
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,480
we're up to something big.

136
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,400
We attack the three o'clock coach,
near the river.

137
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,160
There is no room for an invalid.

138
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,520
I'm glad you're feeling better.

139
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,000
I'll see you later.

140
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,600
By the river, huh?

141
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,800
I'll be there.

142
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,920
Just a few more minutes.

143
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,680
The thieves never rob on this
on this path.

144
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,680
We scare them.

145
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,160
Drop your weapons,
don't turn around.

146
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,000
Throw away the money.

147
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,200
Continue straight ahead
without turning around.

148
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,920
This is going to be a big one.

149
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,040
They're coming in.

150
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,080
He got us from behind,
impossible to see his face.

151
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,240
He must be telling the truth,
the money is nowhere to be found.

152
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,720
It's okay, get out of the way.

153
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,840
Someone has passed us.

154
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,480
Did you tell Smith?

155
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,560
He can't move, he's at Pete's.

156
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,440
Let's go, guys.

157
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,920
Let's split up and try
find that money.

158
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,520
Hurry Sally, this is important.

159
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,640
He could have cleared me,
but he let me go to jail.

160
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,920
One day I'll find him.

161
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,240
- And on that day...
- I'm sorry,

162
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,400
but why do you work
for this band?

163
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,520
It's among this kind of people
that I can find my man.

164
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,080
And then I have a friend
in this band.

165
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,120
I'd better go.

166
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,520
Don't forget, in the hollow tree
near the crossing.

167
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,321
Tell the sheriff that you've been
you were warned by mail.

168
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,200
You lost your ribbon.

169
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,400
I'll get another one.

170
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,120
I wasn't expecting your visit.

171
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,800
What about the stagecoach?

172
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,520
It didn't go well.

173
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,800
Someone has passed us.
The guys think it was you.

174
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,000
It's suspicious that you got out.

175
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,120
If it wasn't for the other night,
I would have suspected you too.

176
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,760
But maybe it's me.

177
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,840
Where were you, anyway?

178
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,560
Still at Sally's, huh?

179
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,440
We're buddies and I like you,

180
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,720
but if I find out
you're talking to Sally...

181
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,400
You think you're enough for her,
maybe?

182
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,320
What about you?

183
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,640
No, not at all.

184
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,240
Maybe you're right.

185
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,240
I've been suspicious ever since
a woman betrayed me.

186
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,560
It's been years.

187
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,520
I'm from Baltimore, actually.

188
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,960
Yes, why?

189
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,080
I knew someone in Baltimore.

190
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,840
I came here
to get my health back.

191
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,640
When I got home,

192
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,080
my wife was in the arms
of another man. I killed her.

193
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,040
I came here to hide.

194
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,600
I've been a fugitive ever since.

195
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,120
Her name was Conlon?

196
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,520
Why do you want to know?

197
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,880
I read this story
in the newspapers.

198
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,240
Everyone had to talk about it.

199
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,480
I don't read them anymore
since that day.

200
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,320
So, you don't know the rest
of the story?

201
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,560
Never heard of it again.

202
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,640
Come on, you need a drink.

203
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,800
We should drop this whole thing

204
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,640
or we'll end up on the end of a rope.

205
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,040
This is Pete's pipe.

206
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,040
Let's do it again, guys.

207
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,640
The mine is sending gold
by the afternoon coach.

208
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,560
- Tomorrow.
- After this shot, I stop.

209
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,520
Let me laugh,
you'll lose everything in poker.

210
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,320
- I don't trust this guy.
- He's legit.

211
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,200
Since he's been here,
somebody's been calling the sheriff.

212
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,960
I think it's a snitch.

213
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,400
He doesn't have the right information
for this one.

214
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,320
Why do you dress so well?

215
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,680
I'm going shopping.

216
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,400
- Why?
- Hold this.

217
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,400
I'm going to buy...

218
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
eggs.

219
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,960
Otherwise the guys will be unhappy
tomorrow morning.

220
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,400
Maybe you were right
about Smith.

221
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,880
It took you long enough.

222
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,720
He went to warn them
about the attack tomorrow.

223
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,840
But the stagecoach will be here
this afternoon.

224
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,360
The gold will be too heavy
for our horses.

225
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,160
I'm going to follow him, just to see.

226
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,520
If we come back together,
it's all right,

227
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,520
but if he comes back alone...

228
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,760
We'll know what to do.

229
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,800
I think Brant is alive.

230
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,520
I'm sure this is the man
who attacked the store.

231
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,360
He managed to get out of the lake.

232
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,320
Let's take these posters
and go see Sally.

233
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,440
Give this note to Miss Sally,
please.

234
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,880
And hand it to her personally.

235
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,160
A man told me
to give you this note.

236
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,680
I need to see you,
meet me at Pete's.

237
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,960
I want you to identify
these men.

238
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,920
Aren't they the ones from the other night?

239
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,080
I don't think so, Sheriff.

240
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,320
I wouldn't be able
recognize them.

241
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,840
Maybe we're wrong.

242
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,680
I've known Sally since
she was a little girl,

243
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,600
but I find it hard to believe her,
she's hiding something from us.

244
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,840
We should follow her.

245
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,480
Hi John,
what are you doing here?

246
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,040
I came to help you
to carry the eggs.

247
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,080
What's wrong with you?
I don't recognize you.

248
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,800
It's nothing.

249
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,400
I need a drink.

250
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,880
Go away, the sheriff suspects
something,

251
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,320
since I told him about
about the stagecoach robbery.

252
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,920
He showed me your
He showed me your wanted notice.

253
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,720
Thank you for letting me know.

254
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,040
Hands up, guys!

255
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,160
We're arresting you, Brant,

256
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,200
and you too, Conlon.

257
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,440
Let's get some backup.

258
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,720
Two of us don't stand a chance.
No chance.

259
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,960
Run to the corral,

260
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,320
get a horse and go to the mine,
I'll take care of them.

261
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,160
- Why are you taking this risk?
- I know the area.

262
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,400
I'll meet you at the hideout.

263
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,360
Where is he?
Is he okay?

264
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,520
Him, always him!

265
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,440
Yes, he's fine.

266
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,200
You'll never see him again.

267
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:39,040
He's going to have a great trip,
he won't betray anyone anymore.

268
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,920
He won't get you either.

269
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,960
- What a fool I was!
- That's right.

270
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,840
You are a fool,
you're the traitor.

271
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,560
You are betraying the best friend
you ever had.

272
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,720
He was charged in your place,

273
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,800
he escaped to get back at you,

274
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,440
but he changed his mind,

275
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,840
to finally help you.

276
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,120
You have to save him.

277
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,680
I'm such a bastard.

278
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,280
Tell the sheriff to go to the mine.

279
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,480
I'm going to get Smith
before they kill him.

280
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,520
They're over there.

281
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,000
Smith arrives alone.

282
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,200
Places, guys.

283
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,440
The whole gang is waiting for
Brant at the mine.

284
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,080
Take cover.

285
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,480
John has betrayed us too.

286
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,000
We're going to catch them
by going around.

287
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,320
They're coming from everywhere.

288
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,800
They are surrounding us.

289
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,880
Come on, we've got them.

290
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,120
Let's not stay here.

291
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,920
- We don't have a choice.
- You're forgetting about the tunnel.

292
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,040
You shoot, I'm driving.

293
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,880
They went this way.

294
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,320
There are more over there.

295
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,200
Don't stop, I'll climb a tree
a tree and surprise them.

296
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,600
Put him on a horse,
we'll bring him back.

297
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,480
Don't move me.

298
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,240
I'm bleeding...

299
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,160
inside.

300
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,840
This time, you won't escape me.

301
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,680
We won't try.

302
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,000
He's about to die.

303
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,760
I escape the rope,

304
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,640
but before I die...

305
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,080
I want to tell you...

306
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,240
I killed Georges Wagner.

307
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,160
Brant is innocent.

308
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,600
I didn't know...

309
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,720
Sorry, partner.

310
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,160
I'm glad.

311
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,280
I always said he wouldn't make
a good gangster.

312
