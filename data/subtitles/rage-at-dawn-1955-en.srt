00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,010
Have you've forgotten?

168
00:15:59,010 --> 00:15:59,810
Edelbach tried.

169
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,950
Look what happened to him.

170
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,200
We'd best let Peterson take
care of the Reno brothers.

171
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,920
He was waiting for us,
loaded up and waiting.

172
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,800
Somebody told
him we was comin'.

173
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,850
Maybe Peterson's got
a man planted in town.

174
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,920
Who knowed you was
going to North Vernon?

175
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,090
You three.

176
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,410
Now hold on, Frank.

177
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,230
He's not accusing us, Judge.

178
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,100
He knows we wouldn't
kill the golden geese.

179
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,800
Did Clint know you was going?

180
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,830
It wasn't Clint.

181
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,570
He ain't one of
us, but he wouldn't

182
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,720
Have no part of
settin' up an ambush.

183
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,860
Maybe it was Sim.

184
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,610
He's kind of talky
when he's drinking.

185
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,880
Yeah, and he does most of his
drinking at Murphy's place.

186
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,790
Yeah, and his bragging.

187
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,310
And Murphy's the only new
man to come to town in years.

188
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,520
Do you suppose
Murphy's a Peterson man?

189
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,820
Gimme a beer, Murphy.

190
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,850
Hello, Sim.

191
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,150
Doing a little drinking, eh?

192
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,320
Yeah, going to do a lot more.

193
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,610
Shot him in the back.

194
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,340
They shot him in the back.

195
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,120
Yeah, I heard about Bill.

196
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,930
What happened over
in North Vernon?

197
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,520
I made a mistake.

198
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,660
I shot too fast, woke up
the town, and they got Bill.

199
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,690
Shot him in the back.

200
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,760
All my fault.

201
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,330
Clumsy.

202
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,290
All my fault.

203
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,690
Hm, I don't think Bill
would have felt that way.

204
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,660
He always thought
you were the best.

205
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,480
I was the best 'til...
'til I made that mistake.

206
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,560
I let Bill down and...
And now he's dead.

207
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,690
He's dead.

208
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,740
Yeah, we all have to
go sooner or later.

209
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,760
But they're going to go sooner.

210
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,110
Come Saturday, we're going
back to North Vernon and blast

211
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,560
The devil out.

212
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:56,780
We'll get even for Bill, and
this time, we'll get the money.

213
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,250
We'll get the money this time.

214
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,270
Murphy!

215
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,720
What happened?

216
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,750
He closed the saloon about 10.

217
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,420
I followed him home.

218
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,500
Through the window, I saw
him write a note first,

219
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,160
Then he went out the barn,
saddled a horse, and left.

220
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,370
Where'd he go?

221
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,440
Up the Glendale road.

222
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,980
Couldn't follow
without him knowing it.

223
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,250
How long ago was that?

224
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,540
30, 40 minutes.

225
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,720
But where does
he mail this note?

226
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,220
They don't.

227
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,970
He hides it someplace
for another Peterson man

228
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:40,680
To pick up.

229
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,410
A stinkin' spy.

230
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,180
We'll find out about
that soon enough.

231
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,560
You reckon he'll
be home by now?

232
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,460
We'll wait.

233
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,240
We've got time.

234
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,760
Tell Dobe to get the horses.

235
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,300
Dobe, I'm ready to mount.

236
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,620
Why, Frank.

237
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,080
Where you been, Murphy?

238
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,240
Riding.

239
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,310
One o'clock in the morning?

240
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,620
Is there some rule about
when a man go riding?

241
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,940
You stinkin' spy.

242
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,440
Spy?

243
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,970
What are you talking about, Sim?

244
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,500
You're a Peterson man.

245
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,090
Peterson man?

246
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,910
You're crazy.

247
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:02,280
Don't lie to us, Murphy.

248
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,520
You know me, boys.

249
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,200
You've known me for a long time.

250
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,610
Yeah.

251
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,160
We know you tipped
off Peterson that we

252
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,470
Was going to raid the
bank in North Vernon.

253
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,980
Why would I do that?

254
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,620
'Cause you're
gettin' paid for it.

255
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,070
You just delivered
a letter saying

256
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,630
We were going to hit
North Vernon again,

257
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:21,010
Didn't you, Murphy?

258
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,760
I don't know where
you got such an idea.

259
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,050
We baited you, Murphy.

260
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,640
Simmy just played
like he was gettin'

261
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,240
Drunk and givin' away secrets.

262
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,320
We knowed that'd flush
you out, and Cortright

263
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,490
Saw you writin' a letter.

264
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,930
Cortright's lyin'.

265
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:37,610
Get a rope.

266
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,980
You kill me, Frank,
somebody else will come.

267
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,800
We'll handle him, too.

268
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,780
Tie him up to the stall there.

269
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,710
John, get that
horse out of there.

270
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,430
Maybe we ought to
let him come too,

271
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,910
So he can know what's happening.

272
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,080
We got time.

273
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,440
There's another
letter for Peterson.

274
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,060
Monk Claxton's here, Dad.

275
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:11,660
Oh good.

276
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,880
Have him come in.

277
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,490
Come on in, Monk.

278
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,410
Thank you, Bill.

279
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,690
Hello, Mr. Peterson.

280
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:18,990
Glad to see you, Monk.

281
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:19,490
Sit down.

282
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,060
Thank you, sir.

283
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:20,980
How are things in Denver?

284
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,650
Couldn't be better, Bill.

285
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,840
Did you read about Murphy?

286
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,600
Yes, sir.

287
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,500
I did.

288
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,090
That's what happens when
something goes wrong.

289
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,430
They're shrewd, those
Renos, and vicious.

290
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,370
Control the whole county
in southern Indiana...

291
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,620
Judge, prosecutor,
constable, all on their side.

292
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,220
Renos had 'em elected.

293
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,740
I still wonder how a thing
like that could happen.

294
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,490
Well people who've
had freedom as long

295
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,060
As we have sometimes
take it for granted.

296
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,320
Come election day,
they're lazy or callous.

297
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,640
Same thing.

298
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,210
However, it's done.

299
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,670
Our job is to get it undone.

300
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,020
Yes, sir.

301
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,430
How do we go about it?

302
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,520
You're a married man, Monk.

303
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,220
Yes, sir.

304
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,420
My wife knows the
line of work I'm in.

305
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,770
I don't want you to
jump into this thing.

306
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,430
I didn't know exactly
what you had in mind,

307
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:11,180
But to bring me all the way from
Denver, the way I figure it,

308
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,320
This is sort of a promotion.

309
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,090
Well, don't let your
vanity get in the way

310
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,640
Of your better judgment, Monk.

311
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,630
I'm a working man,
Bill, with a job to do.

312
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,790
If I didn't like my work, I'd
have gotten out of it long ago.

313
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,610
In the war, we called
it calculated risk.

314
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,260
Yeah, we did.

315
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,900
I've got a new man I want
you to work with, Monk.

316
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,840
I don't figure this is a
time to break in a greenhorn.

317
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,210
Oh, new to us, that is.

318
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,810
He's had some experience
along this line.

319
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,790
Maybe not experience with
this kind of violence,

320
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,870
But I think he's the
kind of a man that

321
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,520
Can handle himself
in rough going.

322
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,080
Name is James Barlow.

323
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,940
Barlow.

324
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,980
Hm, I see you remember him.

325
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,050
If it's the same James
Barlow I'm thinking of,

326
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,430
I do remember him.

327
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,160
He is.

328
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,330
He was in the employ
of the southern states.

329
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:59,280
Which we found
out after the war.

330
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,640
Mr. Greeley said that he
was worth a whole army.

331
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,370
It's the only thing
that Mr. Greeley ever

332
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,550
Said that Mr.
Lincoln agreed with.

333
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:09,400
I still wonder how he got
hold of so many secrets.

334
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,950
Certain generals' wires
found him very charming.

335
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:15,060
Irresistible is the word, Dad.

336
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,760
As a matter of fact, I recall...

337
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,770
Well, I wasn't the only one
that invited him to dinner.

338
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:22,360
Secretary Stanton had him too.

339
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,390
Immodest as it may sound,
man could fool Stanton

340
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:29,260
And me could fool the Reno boys.

341
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,140
That sounds mighty
reasonable, sir.

342
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,660
You are to trust
him implicitly.

343
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,670
Let him run the whole show.

344
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,990
How does he plan to get
in with the Reno brothers?

345
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:37,490
He doesn't.

346
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,870
He plans to let them
get in with him.

347
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,990
In making out your report to
the sheriff on this robbery,

348
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,460
My description is as follows.

349
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:24,600
Six feet three, 195 pounds,
hazel eyes, and brown hair.

350
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,200
Six three, 195 pounds,
hazel eyes, and brown hair.

351
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,580
We just hit the grate.

352
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,770
Be about half a minute.

353
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:47,380
Good.

354
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,760
Pull the cord.

355
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,710
I'll get the [INAUDIBLE].

356
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,390
Now, you want me
to dump the box

357
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,590
When you give me the signal.

358
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,500
After I jump, take
a few shots at me.

359
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,540
Remember, I took your gun but
you had another one hidden.

360
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,970
First I take some shots at you.

361
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,280
When the train stops,
I give the alarm.

362
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:01,780
Right.

363
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,110
Open the door.

364
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:24,020
[GUNSHOTS]

365
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,770
Right on schedule, Jim.

366
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,160
[GUNSHOTS]

367
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:36,730
Morning.

368
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,650
Morning.

369
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,740
Ain't that old man Euall's rig?

370
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,240
Yes.

371
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,760
He's my uncle.

372
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,510
I'd like a side of salt
meat, 10 pounds of sugar,

373
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:48,490
Five pounds of coffee, some
baking soda, and a bathtub.

374
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,510
All right, Mister.

375
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,360
Morning.

376
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,560
Good morning.

377
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,350
I take it you're Jim
Barlow, Noah Euall's nephew.

378
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,270
That's right.

379
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,130
Said a couple of days
ago he was expecting you.

380
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,380
Staying at the farm?

381
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,960
Mm-hm.

382
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,180
Hear you're a painter.

383
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,450
Yes, I am.

384
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,320
What do you paint?

385
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,150
Oh, um, things, people.

386
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:13,970
Like El Greco,
Rembrandt, Van Dyke.

387
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,300
Not quite.

388
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,140
Oh, um, this is Mr. Claxton.

389
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:17,720
How do you do?

390
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,560
Pleased to meet you.

391
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,280
You a painter too?

392
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:19,780
No.

393
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,930
I'm just looking
after Mr. Barlow.

394
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:23,450
He's not fully
recovered from the war.

395
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:23,950
Oh.

396
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:29,340
Morning, Miss Laura.

397
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,210
Good morning, Mr. Fisher.

398
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,610
Um, is my order ready?

399
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,110
Yes.

400
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:35,700
Just finished it.

401
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:44,780
Oh, um, Miss Reno,
this is Mr. Barlow.

402
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,500
How do you do, Mr. Barlow?

403
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,970
It's a pleasure, Miss Reno.

404
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,190
Noah Euall's nephew.

405
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,860
He's a painter.

406
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,080
Oh?

407
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,610
SHOPKEEPER (OFFSCREEN):
Will that be all, sir?

408
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:54,490
Excuse me, please.

409
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,240
Mm-hm.

410
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:13,560
Um, $3.20.

411
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,220
Mr. Fisher, can you change this?

412
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,450
Mr. Barlow.

413
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,490
Have you got anything smaller?

414
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,360
Sorry.

415
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,760
I haven't.

416
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,450
Mm.

417
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,700
Take all my change.

418
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,350
Here you are, sir.

419
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,410
Thank you very much
and come again.

420
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,210
I'll do that.

421
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,380
I'll be around for some time.

422
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,590
There you are, Miss Laura.

423
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,720
May I help?

424
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,830
Oh, don't bother.

425
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,120
Quite the contrary.

426
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,090
Well, thank you.

427
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,780
Who's that with Laura?

428
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,280
I never seen him before.

429
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,090
Thank you very much.

430
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,870
I hope to see you
again, Miss Laura.

431
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,610
May I call on you sometime?

432
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,830
Boy.

433
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:44,240
I'm afraid not, Mr. Barlow.

434
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,140
Who are you, Mister?

435
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,170
That's none of
your business, Pete.

436
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:50,270
Better be on your way, you.

437
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,560
I bet your pardon.

438
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,730
You heard him.

439
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,280
On your way.

440
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,020
My friends, you have
very good manners.

441
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,980
[YELLS]

442
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:08,800
Monk.

443
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,270
Take his gun belt.

444
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,130
Sorry, Miss Laura.

445
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:27,800
Still up to your
old tricks, eh?

446
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,480
$30,000, Frank.

447
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,240
That's a heap of money.

448
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,630
Are you out of your mind?

449
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,150
I told you.

450
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:36,520
We didn't do this train robbery.

451
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,620
The robber wore a mask, had
hazel eyes and sandy hair,

452
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,580
Was around 35
years old, six feet

453
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:45,640
Three inches,
weight, 195 pounds.

454
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,530
The description fits you, John.

455
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:50,330
Careful, Lattimore.

456
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:53,150
Fits a lot of
other people, too.

457
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,280
$30,000.

458
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,850
The judge would be
mighty pleased to share

459
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,400
In a heap of money like that.

460
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,420
We didn't do it.

461
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,380
But I wish we had.

462
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,580
Don't argue with him, sir.

463
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,000
You're in no position
to get uppity.

464
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,500
Listen.

465
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,950
You've got your full portion
of every job we've ever pulled,

466
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,320
And you'll go right
on gettin' it,

467
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,820
So don't come around
here accusing us

468
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,020
Of holding out on you.

469
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,190
All right, Frank.

470
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:18,110
But as prosecuting attorney
of this country, I warn you.

471
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,250
You sure was rough on him.

472
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,530
Be rougher not to
accuse us anymore.

473
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:40,090
Sit around doing nothing
while we take all the chances.

474
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:40,990
At least he's in the hole.

475
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,540
You've got to pay
for aces in the hole.

476
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:45,050
$30,000 is a heap of money.

477
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,830
Now, who'd have thought
of holding up a train?

478
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:58,280
Seems like a business
worth considerin'.

479
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,280
What was the matter with them?

480
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,780
Oh, money crazy as usual.

481
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,630
They're accusing John
of holding up the train.

482
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,840
Yeah, but Frank shut
'em up real proper.

483
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,370
You think it's smart
to make them mad?

484
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,170
They'd better worry
about making me mad.

485
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,290
How'd it go?

486
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,110
Fine, Noah.

487
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,210
You set it up well.

488
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,840
Good.

489
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,680
Buy some extra shootin' iron?

490
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,180
No.

491
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,620
We met a young lady.

492
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,110
Two gentlemen objected.

493
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,630
Turned out to be a couple
of fellas named Lee and Pete.

494
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,500
Oh, they're a couple
of the Reno gang.

495
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,340
The family?

496
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:49,870
No.

497
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:50,940
Just henchmen.

498
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,710
Oh.

499
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,350
Well, you certainly started
the ball rolling, all right.

500
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,560
We sure did.

501
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,890
That's the object.

502
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,460
But the description
does fit John Reno.

503
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,650
John Reno didn't do it.

504
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,600
He never does
anything by himself.

505
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,640
Frank does all the thinkin'.

506
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,090
Frank didn't do it, either.

507
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:09,120
Mind don't run that way.

508
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,850
You're too suspicious.

509
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,530
We got a right
to be suspicious.

510
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,350
Our share keeps gettin'
smaller and smaller.

511
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:16,050
First thing you know, they'll
deal us out completely.

512
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,540
How can they?

513
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,840
We'll be reelected next
month for two more years.

514
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,950
They know which side
their bread's buttered on.

515
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:26,100
You think we can get away
with this for two more years?

516
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,320
Our collusion with
the Reno brothers

517
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,450
Is one of the worst
kept secrets in history.

518
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:33,000
Collusion, conspiracy,
malfeasance.

519
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,050
Ugly words, your
honor, but true.

520
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,660
We've got to be realistic.

521
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,180
The bank job in North Vernon
sure would have helped.

522
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,260
No need cryin' about that.

523
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,480
We'll make it up on
that Davies County job.

524
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,690
How much do tax
collections run?

525
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,390
Might amount to $20,000.

526
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,590
This time, we'll
protect ourselves.

527
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,380
We'll send Jason or
Cortright with 'em.

528
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,750
Oh, they ain't
had no experience

529
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,700
In that kind of thing.

530
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,850
Experience doesn't matter.

531
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,550
When the money is counted,
I want somebody there

532
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,150
We can trust.

533
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:01,050
Think you'll ever find
anybody you can trust?

534
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,110
For you, Judge.

535
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,680
That was the
[INAUDIBLE] at the bank.

536
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,340
Just come across one
of them $100 bills

537
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,820
From the train robbery.

538
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,340
Serial numbers check.

539
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,940
Where'd he get it?

540
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,770
Wade Fisher's department.

541
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,700
You reckon one of
the Renos spent it?

542
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,420
We're sure going to
find out who spent it.

543
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,480
Sure, I remember.

544
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,310
First $100 bill
I've seen in years.

545
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,940
Noah Euall's nephew spent it.

546
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,230
The one that tangled with
Pete McCartney and Lee Harney?

547
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:33,870
That's right.

548

Name's Barlow.

549
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:35,670
He's a painter.

550
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,580
New fella.

551
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,900
He had to be new to
tangle with those two.

552
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,610
Had a whole handful
of $100 bills.

553
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,190
Something wrong?

554
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,600
Oh no, no.

555
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,540

556
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,120

557
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,790
A whole handful of $100 bills?

558
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,010
Something else, too.

559
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:00,050
He fits the description
of the holdup man.

560
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:03,180
I'd say he has some
explaining to do.

561
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,700
You fellas better get at it.

562
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,330
I'm getting sick and tired
of you snarling at me.

00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,990
Well then behave yourself.

564
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:17,100
You know how I feel about
you taking up with strangers.

565
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,480
I didn't take up with him.

566
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,840
He helped me into the
buggy with my packages.

567
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,860
Well, the boys said you and
him was getting mighty friendly.

568
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,210
Now you understand one thing.

This is my house.

00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,950
You want to go on using it,
you'd better be careful.

571
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,380
All right.

572
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,780
Let's get back to the
Davies County job.

573
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,810
This time, we're not
all going in at once.

Thank you for bring these back.

Guess those two cooled off

Don't order me around, Frank.

Why, nothing.

586
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,180
I'm just returning
some equipment

That belongs to friends of

I'm her brother.

Well, Mister, I must say,
you don't act very neighborly.

Got no cause to be neighborly.

Get off of the

Stop it, Frank.

There had been a train robbery.

647
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,700
We found the money.

I guess the robbers dropped it.

00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,380
Everything matches.

659
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:34,950
Coincidence.

660
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:35,870
Where's the money?

661
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:36,500
You took it.

662
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,620
I mean the rest of
it, the other $29,000.

663
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,900
Oh, what's the use.

664
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,940
You wouldn't believe me.

665
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:42,840
Any news?

666
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,070
He won't talk.

667
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,110
How about him?

668
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:47,210
Nothing.

669
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:47,780
All right.

670
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,210
On your feet.

671
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,170
Come on.

672
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,380
Where's the money?

673
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,850
Lattimore was asking him
questions, and all of a sudden,

674
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:18,710
Barlow said, get the judge,
and Lattimore got excited.

675
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:21,300
Kept saying he was the
prosecuting attorney

676
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,040
And if Barlow had
anything to say,

677
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,670
He was the one to say it to.

678
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:27,020
Naturally, I'm
the one to talk to.

679
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,630
Lattimore's trying
to hog everything.

680
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:43,530
He wants to talk to you.

681
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:44,530
So we're here.

682
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:47,740
Go ahead and talk.

683
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,330
Hello.

684
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:50,390
You listen to me.

685
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:52,610
I'm the prosecuting
attorney here.

686
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:53,520
Wait outside.

687
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,760
This was my doing.

688
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,250
He never budged until I tried to
get the express messenger down

689
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,500
Here to identify him.

690
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,620
That's what we can do.

691
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,200
Wait outside.

692
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:21,240
Now what was it
you wanted to say?

693
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,710
Can I have a drink
of water, Judge?

694
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:23,700
Go ahead.

695
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:34,180
Do you appreciate irony, Judge?

696
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,600
How's that?

697
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,240
The imponderables?

698
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,110
The little things that
happen to wreck the foolproof

699
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:47,130
Setup that you can never
figure will happen?

700
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:48,830
This was a foolproof setup.

701
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:51,960
I had a contact man in the
express office who told me

702
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,170
When the money would be shipped.

703
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:55,610
I picked the perfect spot
for the train robbery.

704
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,190
The money box was open just
right, and up to that point,

705
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:00,000
Everything was perfect.

706
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,470
And then... and then
came the imponderable.

707
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,340
In my hurry to get away,
I dropped a few bills

708
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,810
With serial numbers,
and here I am.

709
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:14,310
Irony.

710
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,990
Where's the money?

711
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:22,920
Hidden.

712
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,300
My share, that is.

713
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,070
Your share?

714
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:28,390
You're in this all by yourself.

715
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:30,200
No man could do
this by himself.

716
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,300
There were six of us.

717
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,250
Seven, counting the contact man.

718
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:35,390
Where are they now?

719
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:37,610
Scattered.

720
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,410
That leaves three here.

721
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:39,980
Two.

722
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,630
Claxton and me.

723
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:43,070
Euall had nothing to do with it.

724
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:44,590
He didn't know about it.

725
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,080
Claxton's share hidden too?

726
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,540
With mine at the Euall farm.

727
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,470
Where at the Euall farm?

728
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:51,500
You couldn't find it.

729
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,430
I'd have to go with you.

730
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,960
Now, um, you're a
practical man, Judge.

731
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,060
Sure, you can send
Claxton and me to prison,

732
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,060
But it won't get you
a raise in salary

733
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,960
And it won't get you
much of a reward.

734
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,680
And as for me, with a contact
man who knows when the big

735
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,460
Express money shipments
are to be made,

736
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:20,700
It'll... it'll ruin a
$1 million business.

737
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,990
You say you've got a contact
man in the express office?

738
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:24,190
JAMES BARLOW
(OFFSCREEN): A big one.

739
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:27,130
A superintendent.

740
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:28,340
Which office?

741
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:31,670
I'm a practical man too, Judge.

742
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:33,910
How do I know you ain't lying?

743
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:36,080
You think I held up that train
on the spur of the moment?

744
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,680
How do you think I knew
the money was aboard?

745
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:45,950
A $1 million business,
but not with me in prison.

746
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:47,300
We don't get it,
somebody else will.

747
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,170
I don't like the
way you talk, like

748
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:56,090
The way you handle yourself.

749
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:58,520
All I need is a little freedom.

750
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,560
It won't be that simple.

751
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,230
Lot of people here
in town know you

752
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:03,600
Were arrested with
some of that holdup

753
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,800
Money in your possession.

754
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,530
All you've got
to say is I proved

755
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:08,520
I found it around the money box.

756
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,200
Others did.

757
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,460
And what guarantee have
I got if I turn you loose,

758
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:13,350
You won't pull out?

759
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:14,280
The best in the world.

760
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,690
I need you more
than you need me.

761
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:20,230
This is a safe place to
hole up between operations.

762
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:22,260
Besides, if I did
pull out, you'd

763
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:27,540
Still be better off by $3,000.

764
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,010
Hm.

765
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:29,510
Hm.

766
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:40,940
Gentlemen, I guess we owe
Mr. Barlow an apology.

767
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:43,560
He's clean as a hound's tooth.

768
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,290
Wait a minute.

769
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:45,490
Perhaps you misunderstood me.

770
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:48,780
Mr. Barlow had nothing to
do with the train robbery.

771
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:51,120
He found the money.

772
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:51,950
Oh.

773
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:52,640
Oh.

774
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,460
That was our opinion, too.

775
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:56,110
Yeah, clean as a hound's tooth.

776
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:57,920
Have Cortright
release the other two.

777
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,680
I'm going out to the Euall
farm with Mr. Barlow.

778
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:01,390
Mind if I go, too?

779
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:02,420
And me?

780
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,690
Try and stop you.

781
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:06,830
Oh by the way, um,
did you two gents

782
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:09,710
Give the judge his share of
the $600 you took from me?

783
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:35,400
Here you are, your
honor. $30,000.

784
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,040
This is only the beginning.

785
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,540
All right.

786
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,390
So far so good.

787
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:40,780
Now where do we go from here?

788
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:43,670
We, um, we have to wait
for news from head office.

789
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,780
Let's hope it
won't be too long.

790
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:48,280
We hope stronger
than you since we're

791
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,310
The ones who have
been cleaned out.

792
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:52,180
Have a good day, gentlemen.

793
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:58,510
I'd rather nab those three
than to turn in the Reno boys.

794
00:48:58,510 --> 00:48:59,860
Take it easy, Jim.

795
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:00,830
One thing at a time.

796
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,150
Was that, um, $2,000 even?

797
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,220
You'll get yours,
Mr. Prosecutor.

798
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:13,130
You'll get it.

799
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:15,310
Just askin'.

800
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:19,060
You know, I'm just thinkin'.
He'd be a good one to send

801
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:23,190
To Davies County with the Renos
instead of Jason or Cortright.

802
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:24,540
Maybe.

803
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:25,040
One thing.

804
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,840
He don't scare easy.

805
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,650
You reckon the Renos
would stand for it?

806
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:29,460
They'll have to.

807
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,000
We'll make it a court order.

808
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:39,660
Anything else, Miss Laura?

809
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:40,420
Oh, yes.

810
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,200
I'd like a side of bacon.

811
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,240
But yesterday you...

812
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,500
I know.

813
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,740
I'd like another side of bacon.

814
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:48,810
Very well.

815
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:50,490
Eight and a half
pounds all right?

816
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:51,700
Fine.

817
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,230
Anything else?

818
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:54,430
That's all.

819
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:58,760
Um, here's that, um, article
you asked for, Miss Laura.

820
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,220
Oh, thank you.

821
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,690
Goodbye, Mr. Fisher.

822
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:05,150
Goodbye, Miss Laura.

823
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:06,140
Howdy, Laura.

824
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,120
Oh, Clint.

825
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,150
Um, Mr. Barlow, I'd like you
to meet my brother, Clint.

826
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:10,890
How are you?

827
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:13,750
How do you do?

828
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:14,750
Nice meeting you, Mr. Barlow.

829
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:26,740
Oh.

830
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:27,240
Sorry.

831
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:36,580
It's, um, a book I
borrowed from Mr. Fisher.

832
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:39,340
Interested in
painters, Miss Laura?

833
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,860
Yes.

834
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,820
16th century painters.

835
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,870
Oh.

836
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:47,030
I don't think you're going
to find me in this edition.

837
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,530
What time shall
we shop tomorrow?

838
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:09,660
A couple more shopping
days like this and I

839
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:10,760
Can open my own store.

840
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:16,660
It's been a genuine
pleasure, Miss Laura.

841
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,140
I agree.

842
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:19,630
Thank you, Mr. Barlow.

843
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:20,610
Good day.

844
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:47,250
You aiming on getting
yourself killed?

845
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:48,000
Contrary.

846
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,380
I was just planning my future.

847
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:51,760
I don't like you, Barlow.

848
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,810
Don't like your talk,
but I admire guts.

849
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:57,870
Judge Hawkins said you are
pretty good at train robbin'.

850
00:51:57,870 --> 00:51:59,360
Fair, I'd say.

851
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,600
Seems to think you're good
enough to ride with the Renos.

852
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,030
That's a compliment.

853
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:06,920
My partner and I will
consider your invitation.

854
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,360
No partners.

855
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,950
Judge didn't say
nothing about nobody.

856
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:11,560
Just you.

857
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,560
I see.

858
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,290
Um, when do we go?

859
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:16,030
Now.

860
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:17,340
Now?

861
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,460
Um, where?

862
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:21,640
When you ride with us,
Barlow, don't ask no questions.

863
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:25,520
Come on.

864
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:57,760
Stop.

865
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,230
Let's give 'em a [INAUDIBLE].

866
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:02,760
Isn't that the state
line we just crossed?

867
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,980
Right.

868
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,080
Any harm now in telling
me where we're going?

869
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:06,890
Up ahead.

870
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:07,860
How much farther?

871
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,470
You ask too many questions.

872
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:10,840
What do you mean by that?

873
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:11,340
Look.

874
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:12,620
You're along as an extra hand.

875
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:13,710
You've got nothing to say.

876
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:14,930
Didn't the judge
make that clear?

877
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:15,430
Yeah.

878
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:15,930
All right.

879
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:19,010
Now I'm making it clear, so
get it through your head.

880
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:19,680
All right.

881
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,860
We'll split up, circle
around, and go in.

882
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:22,590
Dobe?

883
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:23,540
Yeah.

884
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:24,670
Meet us on Church Hill.

885
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:27,670
Pick John and Sim up in front
of the surveyor's office.

886
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:28,660
Come on, John.

887
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:43,200
Is everything all right?

888
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,390
Tell Frank the courthouse
is no good the front way.

889
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:46,770
They got to go around the back.

890
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:48,800
But Frank didn't
plan it that way.

891
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,300
Frank didn't plan to
have the sheriff eating

892
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,650
His dinner across
the street either.

893
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:53,150
Ah.

894
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:10,030
See him?

895
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:11,150
He'll be along.

896
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,560
Pete says we've got to use the
back door of the courthouse.

897
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,060
All right.

898
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:33,560
Let's go.

899
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:02,260
Here they are.

900
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:30,900
Raise your hands up.

901
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,890
On your feet and move over.

902
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:36,450
We've got men downstairs,
so don't nobody holler.

903
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:38,370
Over the safe, you.

904
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:40,700
Hurry up!

905
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,570
Against the wall.

906
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:43,780
All right, open it up.

907
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:47,010
Be quick about it!

908
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:48,370
Ain't much money in here.

909
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:51,820
I know what's in there.

910
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:52,640
Now fill that up.

911
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:59,100
Get your hands a
little higher, neighbor.

912
00:56:59,100 --> 00:56:59,600
You!

913
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,360
Get over there.

914
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:01,860
Move!

915
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:14,600
[GUNSHOT]

916
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,510
What are you doing?

917
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,470
Throw it out here.

918
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:22,960
Get out of here.

919
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:23,460
Hurry!

920
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:58,940
Too bad your brains
don't match your guts!

921
00:57:58,940 --> 00:57:59,440
Ha.

922
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:54,480
How much you figure we got?

923
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,610
Plenty.

924
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:57,780
Nice and clean, if
I do say myself.

925
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:59,930
We left those boys far behind.

926
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:02,200
Yeah, but they still got
the telegraph on their side.

927
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,980
This is where we split up.

928
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:05,820
Every man goes back to
the house his own way.

929
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:07,240
Roundabout, too.

930
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,230
Move out!

931
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:23,200
I reckon you didn't
hear me right.

932
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,640
I said this is
where we split up.

933
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,330
I don't know this country.

934
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:29,720
Well, go with one of them.

935
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,410
I'm going with
you, seeing as how

936
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:33,740
You're the one
that's got the money.

937
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:47,710
$21,220.

938
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:52,800
Well, split between 10 of
us, that's $2,122 apiece.

939
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,780
That don't seem like very much.

940
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:56,160
Could've been more.

941
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,070
Why wasn't it, then?

942
00:59:57,070 --> 00:59:57,790
Ask him.

943
00:59:57,790 --> 00:59:59,020
Everything was
going fine until he

944
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:00,200
Took a shot at
one of the clerks.

945
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,070
If I'd let him get his
hands on that pistol,

946
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:04,360
He'd have blown
somebody's head off.

947
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,140
Should've put him on the
floor in the first place.

948
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:09,210
Should've put 'em all on the
floor the moment we went in.

949
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:13,510
You don't think much of the
way I run things, do you?

950
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:14,790
No, not very much.

951
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:18,890
$2,122 apiece for all
this work and risk.

952
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:22,060
[SCOFFS] You'd be better off
if you went back to plowing.

953
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:23,390
MAN (OFFSCREEN): Oh,
you'll get a chance

954
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:25,340
To see what kind of a
job you'll come up with.

955
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:28,220
Won't be for chicken feed
like this, you can bet on it.

956
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:29,060
Count out my share.

957
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:29,760
I want to get to bed.

958
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:38,750
This time, I'll
divide with Claxton,

959
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:43,900
But next time, he's
got to be in on it.

960
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:44,660
Good night.

961
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:49,420
Cold as an icicle.

962
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:50,820
Mighty big for his britches.

963
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:52,870
Handled a six gun
real pretty, though.

964
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:53,840
Real pretty.

965
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:02,190
You paint a pretty
picture, Mr. Barlow.

966
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:08,940
I'm sorry if I disappoint
you, Miss Laura,

967
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,640
But as you know in our
business, a little dishonesty

968
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:15,700
Is necessary now and then.

969
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:19,450
So you're no better
than the rest of them.

970
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:21,270
In fact, you're not as good.

971
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:25,080
At least the Renos don't pretend
to be something they're not.

972
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:27,170
I'm... I'm flattered
by your interest,

973
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:31,150
But if you were attracted by
the painter rather than the man,

974
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:34,850
Maybe it's better
you find out now.

975
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:38,410
I guess it is.

976
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:44,710
I don't expect very much of
people, but I believed in you.

977
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:46,640
I wanted to believe in you.

978
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,260
I wanted so much
to believe in you.

979
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:04,750
I can't wait any longer.

980
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:06,980
I got to get a
message to Peterson.

981
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:08,280
Why don't you wait
'til morning, Monk?

982
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,390
He'll turn up.

983
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:11,240
Maybe so, Noah, maybe not.

984
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,590
He might have been
sidetracked from his business.

afford to let you run things.

But she's loyal to my brothers.

I don't know that I could
do anything about it.

You could break her loose.

That's what you
could do about it.

The Renos are going to be
tried, tried legal and proper.

1314
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:38,610
They're going to be hanged now.

1315
01:24:38,610 --> 01:24:39,110
Step...

1316
01:24:39,110 --> 01:24:41,960
Drop that gun, Barlow.

1317
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:44,230
Get on with it.

1318
01:24:44,230 --> 01:24:46,310
I know you Fisher,
and you, Dedrick.

1319
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:47,900
If you hang these men...

1320
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:00,590
All right, Fisher.

1321
01:25:00,590 --> 01:25:01,890
Who were the others?

1322
01:25:01,890 --> 01:25:03,440
Dedrick, who were they?

1323
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,920
I don't like lynchers much
better than I like outlaws.

1324
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:10,240
Put 'em in the Reno cells.

1325
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:11,420
It was worth it.

1326
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:12,660
After a few years
behind the bars,

1327
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:14,040
Maybe you'll change your tune.

1328
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:19,980
Mighty good shooting, Barlow.

1329
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:22,580
Sorry, fella.

1330
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:24,590
Didn't do much good after all.

1331
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:36,370
Ooh.

1332
01:25:36,370 --> 01:25:39,390
You shouldn't have come here.

1333
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:40,240
I had to.

1334
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:44,560
I'm sorry, Laura.

1335
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,100
I tried.

1336
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,100
I know.

1337
01:26:32,520 --> 01:27:10,970
