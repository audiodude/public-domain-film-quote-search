1
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,428
Shut the door, quick.

2
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,640
Scared of thunder?

3
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,114
No, I like it.

4
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,620
That's good,
'cause there's gonna be more of it.

5
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:07,058
- I brought you food. For the kitten, too.
- Did you steal it?

6
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,718
No, I bought it.

7
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:13,329
And if we get caught, don't go making up
any stories that I did.

8
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,766
I'm in enough trouble as it is.
You and your kitten.

9
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:22,735
- Do you want me to go back, Sam?
- Shut up and eat.

10
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,001
They looking for me?

11
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,948
Your aunt's got every cop in Iverstown
peeping through keyholes.

12
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:32,745
- You won't let them find me?
- You always come running to me.

13
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,384
Got nobody else to run to, Sam.

14
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:42,050
The circus is leaving town tonight.
Their train will go right through here.

15
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,754
When it does, you just follow me.

16
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,491
You run with all your might,
and when you grab on, grab tight.

17
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,760
Don't you worry about me, Sam.

18
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:51,995
Quiet!

19
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,434
There they are.

20
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:01,513
All right, kids.
Unless you got wings, you're caught.

21
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,708
All right, Martha. Let's go.

22
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,197
You'll never catch him!
You'll never catch him!

23
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,326
Don't rough her, you chump.

24
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,562
All right, miss.
We'll take you on home to your aunt.

25
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,981
- Mr. O'Neil to see you, ma'am.
- Show him in.

26
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,856
Mrs. Ivers will see you now.

27
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,267
- Good evening, Mrs. Ivers.
- Good evening.

28
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:05,104
- Good evening, Mrs. Ivers.
- I have good news. Martha...

29
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,873
- What about her?
- Martha has been found.

30
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,140
I know.

31
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,548
Well, it was Walter who was really
responsible for Martha being found.

32
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:16,850
He told the police where she and that boy,
Sam Masterson, usually go.

33
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,048
- Isn't that so, Walter?
- Yes, Father.

34
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,862
The boy will be rewarded.

35
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,692
Well, he's a good boy, and he's bright.

36
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,428
- lf I could afford it, I'd send him...
- Send him to a school like Harvard.

37
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,562
- I guess I've mentioned it before.
- Many times.

38
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,605
Yes, madam?

39
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:40,145
Take the boy to the kitchen, Lynch.
Give him some ice cream.

40
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:43,181
You may give him a piece of cake, too.
Go along.

41
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,946
- You must thank Mrs. Ivers, Walter.
- Thank you, Mrs. Ivers.

42
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,493
You've lost your pupil, Mr. O'Neil.
I'm sending her away.

43
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,523
I know why you offered to tutor Martha.

44
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,895
I know why you've made Walter
do his daily lessons with her.

45
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:07,302
I know why you want him to live here.
A scholarship for Walter, that's why.

46
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,204
But I'm not a foundation, Mr. O'Neil.

47
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,938
I don't care whether Walter drives a truck
or goes to Harvard.

48
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,844
Probably be a lot happier driving a truck.

49
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,578
You are expected, miss.

50
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,782
Just a minute, miss.

51
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,754
The name is Lundeen.

52
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:30,488
You'll tell Mrs. Ivers, the name
of the detective who caught her is Lundeen.

53
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,063
I'll tell her.

54
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,428
I'll take your furs, miss.

55
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,166
- No.
- You'd better, miss.

56
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:45,506
You know how she feels about that cat.
I'll bring it up to your room.

57
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,445
Your aunt is waiting for you.

58
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,597
Come closer, Martha.

59
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,066
Closer, Martha.

60
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,318
Look at me.

61
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,051
You don't seem very sorry.

62
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:39,627
I am. I'm sorry I was caught.

63
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,636
No matter what you do, I won't cry.

64
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,972
This is the fourth time
you've tried to run away.

65
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,134
Each time you were brought back here.
No matter how far you got...

66
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,111
- you were brought back here.
- You don't own the whole world.

67
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:57,944
Enough of it to make sure
that you'll always be brought back here.

68
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,075
Do you understand that?

69
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,119
You understand that?

70
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,124
Your aunt doesn't deserve
such an attitude, Martha.

71
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:09,456
There are not very many women
who would be as patient and as kind.

72
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,622
And there aren't very many little girls
who would be as ungrateful.

73
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,633
When will you understand
that I'm doing all this for you?

74
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,704
That I'm trying to wash the dirt
and grime off you.

75
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,865
- Make an Ivers out of you again.
- My name is Smith.

76
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,999
The same as my father's was.

77
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,806
Your name is Ivers.
I've had it changed legally.

78
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,972
- I don't care what you've done.
- Your name is Ivers...

79
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,879
the same as your mother's was,
before she was stupid enough to marry...

80
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:32,882
Shut up! Shut up!

81
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,350
- How dare you?
- Shut up!

82
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,481
You've still got his foul mouth.

83
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,581
I won't let you talk that way
about my father.

84
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,489
Your father was a nobody, a mill hand.

85
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,687
The best thing he ever did for you
was to die.

86
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,526
- I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
- Martha, stop! Stop!

87
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,123
That's all right, Mr. O'Neil.

88
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,533
Go up to your room
and get into some dry clothes.

89
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,132
After you've had dinner,
I want to have a talk with you.

90
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,946
It's late. I'll go get my son. Good night.

91
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,182
Stay. I'm upset.

92
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,320
- I want someone to talk to.
- Yes, Mrs. Ivers.

93
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,125
Lynch told me to sneak Bundles to you.

94
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:25,636
I thought she'd be hungry,
so I sneaked the milk, too.

95
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:32,710
She hates cats. She hates everything I like.

96
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,743
A policeman came to my house
this morning.

97
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:39,544
He asked me if I had any idea
of where you could have gone.

98
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:43,452
- My father said it was my duty to tell them.
- Your father.

99
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,319
I didn't say a thing.

100
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:49,625
No matter what my father told your aunt.
I didn't say a thing.

101
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,296
I'm cold. I've got to change my clothes.

102
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:55,299
I'll leave the door open, so I can hear you.

103
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,731
My father says you're foolish.

104
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:02,897
My father says that some day
you'll have everything in the world.

105
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:07,069
My father said that if we only had
one little part of what you'll have...

106
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,113
- I could go to Harvard.
- You're what?

107
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,046
I could go to Harvard!

108
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,348
- The lights! What happened to the lights?
- They went out.

109
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,547
I think they went out all over the house.

110
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,649
There's a candle and matches on the table
near the wall.

111
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,887
You stand still. I'll do it.

112
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,041
Don't you think I'd better go up
and see if Martha's all right?

113
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:48,416
Martha will be all right anywhere. Your play.

114
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:57,461
I'm afraid of the thunder and lightning.
Draw the curtains! I'll go in to change.

115
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,530
Martha!

116
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,637
One peep out of you,
and I'll break your nose.

117
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,647
I won't say anything. Martha!

118
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,479
Martha will tell you I won't say anything.

119
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,648
Sam.

120
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:27,223
See, Walter, I told you
they'd never catch him. Sam, button me up.

121
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,055
I came to say good-bye.

122
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,493
I thought it over, Martha.
It's better for you here.

123
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:35,226
- I won't stay here. I hate her!
- All you gotta do is play smart with her.

124
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,131
- I'm going with you.
- Now, you listen to me!

125
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:40,535
- I don't want to listen.
- It's late. I gotta go.

126
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,834
Let him go, Martha.

127
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:45,433
If he's caught here he'll be sent
to reform school. Mrs. Ivers said so.

128
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,535
They gotta catch me first.

129
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,509
All right, Sam, if you won't take me,
I'll go without you.

130
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:53,715
I'll go off by myself.

131
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,118
Okay. Then, let's go.

132
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:01,284
I want to run up to the attic.
I want to get a couple of things.

133
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,961
Sam. Quick, Sam.

134
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,804
Sam, Bundles. She's going downstairs.

135
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,170
- Sam, my aunt.
- I'll get her.

136
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,684
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

137
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,572
Sam, have you got him?
Have you got him, Sam?

138
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:55,412
Hurry, Sam, or that old witch will catch us.

139
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,634
She's dead.

140
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:29,137
We were upstairs.
We heard a noise and we came down.

141
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,977
We saw a man, a big man.

142
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,180
He was leaving. Out of that front door,
he left. See, it's open.

143
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,150
She was lying there.

144
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,516
And this... This was lying there, too.

145
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,483
I picked it up.

146
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,263
Isn't that true, Walter? Isn't it?

147
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,827
Is it, Walter?

148
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,598
Yes, Father, it is.

149
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,911
Put it down.

150
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,482
Put it exactly where you found it.

151
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,020
Both of you better go upstairs.

152
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,322
I'll phone the police.

153
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,839
- You'll never get away with it. Never.
- Your father believes me.

154
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,778
- I don't know. I'm not sure.
- You keep your mouth shut.

155
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,214
But Sam. What about Sam?
He was in the house. He saw it.

156
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,842
- Sam will never tell.
- Yes, he will. He's scared.

157
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,683
- That's why he ran away after it happened.
- Sam will never tell.

158
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,553
Sam's scared. He ran away.
I didn't. I stayed.

159
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,059
No, he won't. Not Sam. Not Sam!

160
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,735
I want to talk to you both.

161
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,308
Sit down.

162
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:22,348
Now, when the police come,
you will tell them...

163
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,656
exactly what you told me.

164
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:28,790
- Do you understand, Martha?
- Yes, Mr. O'Neil.

165
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,328
- And you, too, Walter?
- Yes, Father.

166
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,526
You poor child.

167
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,839
You'll be all alone in the world now.

168
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,603
Except for Walter and myself.

169
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:51,107
But you needn't be afraid.
We'll always be with you, Walter and I.

170
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,952
We'll never leave you.

171
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,780
Thank you, Mr. O'Neil.

172
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,525
<i>... competition at the Fair Grounds last week.</i>

173
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:39,290
<i>In a handicap,</i>
<i>Chestnut King looks like an odds-on favorite.</i>

174
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:42,856
That guy doesn't know what he's talking
about. Chestnut King's a dog.

175
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:46,495
He was losing races to cow ponies
years ago in Tijuana.

176
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:50,735
Well, what do you know?

177
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:54,710
What do you know about that?
How do you like that, sailor?

178
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:59,341
Leave a place when you're a kid, maybe 17,
18 years ago, and you forget all about it.

179
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,180
Then, all of a sudden, you're driving along...

180
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,049
and smacko, your own hometown
up and hits you...

181
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,214
right in the face.

182
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,975
End of the line, sailor. Come on, wake up.

183
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:32,115
- Where are we?
- In a small accident.

184
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:36,020
- What happened?
- The road curved, but I didn't.

185
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:39,386
Come on, I've got to put into Iverstown
for repairs.

186
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,627
Next time, I pick me a guy
that don't fall asleep.

187
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:55,439
Welcome to Iverstown.
Well, maybe this time they mean it.

188
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,979
You got anybody here
to fix this wreck, mister?

189
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,449
Roll her in.

190
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,483
- $10 more, you don't make it.
- Bet.

191
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,079
- $5 more, you don't.
- Bet.

192
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,920
- $5 to you.
- Shoot.

193
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:31,608
- How long will it take, pop?
- Can't tell till we look her over.

194
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:34,275
- Come back tomorrow.
- Open game?

195
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,372
Nope.

196
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,449
- Four.
- Right back, little Joe.

197
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,715
- 20-10 no four.
- You got a bet.

198
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,814
Come on, Harry, make four.

199
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,523
- Seven. You shoot, Joe.
- Thanks.

200
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,185
Shooting 20.

201
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,934
- $10 more, you don't make it.
- $10, I do.

202
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:56,525
- $10 more, you don't make it.
- $10, I do.

203
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,665
- How much will it cost, pop?
- Won't know till it's done.

204
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,805
- Hey, now, look, I want to know now.
- Take it someplace else.

205
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,613
Welcome to Iverstown.

206
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:13,207
<i>We interrupt this program of dinner music</i>
<i>to bring you a special broadcast...</i>

207
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,549
<i>in the interest of the re-election</i>
<i>of District Attorney Walter P. O'Neil.</i>

208
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,680
- Leave that on, will you?
- <i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

209
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,452
<i>it is with deep regret that we are forced to</i>
<i>announce that...</i>

210
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,757
<i>Mr. O'Neil will not be able to address</i>
<i>this citizens' forum tonight.</i>

211
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,387
<i>Mr. O'Neil was suddenly taken ill.</i>

212
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,934
<i>But we are fortunate to have</i>
<i>the best loved civic figure of Iverstown...</i>

213
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:33,835
<i>the gracious Mrs. O'Neil, here in the studio</i>
<i>tonight to speak for him.</i>

214
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:38,103
<i>Citizens of Iverstown,</i>
<i>the issues in this election are simple.</i>

215
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:43,476
- That's enough of that malarkey.
- This Walter P. O'Neil...

216
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,483
isn't that the kid
that used to live on Sycamore Street?

217
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,816
- His father used to be a school teacher?
- Yeah, that's him.

218
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,947
- You know him?
- Yeah, I used to.

219
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:57,095
A little, scared kid on Sycamore Street.
Now he's running for the district attorney.

220
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,721
- What's the odds?
- On what?

221
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,899
- The election.
- No odds. No takers.

222
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,268
This is a sure bet, mister.

223
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,371
Gonna be re-elected. Gonna be governor.

224
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:12,705
And I'm making book right now
that some day he'll run for president.

225
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,810
Gonna be whatever his wife
wants him to be.

226
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:20,316
- Some gal. Who'd he marry?
- You from this town?

227
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:23,653
- Used to be.
- You ought to know her then.

228
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,586
Old lady Ivers' niece.

229
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,054
- Martha Ivers?
- Yep.

230
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,525
Came into the whole works
after the old lady died.

231
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,488
Well, what do you know?

232
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,364
What do you know about that? Martha Ivers.

233
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:49,040
I don't know. You still look like
a scared, little kid, to me.

234
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:55,512
- Hello, Gallagher.
- Hey, wait a minute!

235
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,416
- Do I know you?
- Sure.

236
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,882
I'm the guy who tossed a rock
through that window once.

237
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:06,090
- And you're the guy who chased me.
- lf I chased you, I'll bet I caught you.

238
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,862
Come to think of it, I believe he did.

239
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,639
- Hello.
- Hello.

240
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,980
- You live here?
- Used to.

241
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,587
- Who runs this place?
- Lady, the name of Mrs. Burke.

242
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:09,252
- She's not home.
- You waiting for her?

243
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,689
Just came back to get my things.

244
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,227
I've been away for awhile.

245
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:20,595
- I'm waiting for a taxi.
- I used to live here, in this house.

246
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:24,597
Seventeen, eighteen years ago.
I was born here.

247
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,870
Don't kid me. You're older than that.

248
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,981
Well, I didn't move right after I was born.

249
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,243
Got one to spare?

250
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:38,446
- Got some more matches?
- You can have these.

251
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,692
Got the time?

252
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:47,427
- It's 11: 15.
- Now, ain't that just dandy?

253
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,729
- And I've got an 11:30 bus to catch.
- You can still make it.

254
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,396
Not if the taxi doesn't show up fast.

255
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:57,206
Know anybody who lives around here,
name of Masterson?

256
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:58,876
No.

257
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:02,743
- Know anybody in town at all, by that name?
- No, I'm from Ridgeville.

258
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,579
- Is your name Masterson?
- Yeah.

259
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:11,052
You mean, you're just getting home
after 18 years?

260
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,050
Well, 17 or 18.

261
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,625
You're just getting around
to looking up your people?

262
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,320
No, not exactly.

263
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,693
I just happened to be driving through
on my way West...

264
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,167
and got more or less curious, that's all.

265
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,330
Well, good luck.

266
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:34,137
- What you going to do?
- What do you mean?

267
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,447
I mean about your people.

268
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,578
I don't know. Maybe nothing.

269
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:42,983
Maybe tomorrow I'll go down to the
courthouse and look up the deaths...

270
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,750
- in the last 18 years.
- Can you do that?

271
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,557
Yeah, I think so.

272
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:51,559
Good night.

273
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:09,508
Bus terminal, please hurry.
I've got an 11:30 bus to catch.

274
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,987
Mr. Masterson.

275
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:26,128
- I thought it was you, Mr. Masterson.
- I'm glad to see you again.

276
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:27,755
I gave you my last match.

277
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,460
Want a lift any place on the way
to the bus station?

278
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,434
You talked me into it.

279
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:39,376
You've got my matches. Got a name?

280
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:44,643
Toni. Antonia. Antonia Marachek.

281
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:47,476
Ain't that a dilly, Mr. Masterson?

282
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:48,677
Sam.

283
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,691
Please hurry.

284
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:58,695
The depot's just across the tracks.
You still got four minutes.

285
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,431
We would have made it,
if you didn't stop to pick up your gent.

286
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,436
We might be able to chase it.

287
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:09,439
I can get a bus back to Ridgeville tomorrow.

288
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:12,774
Maybe I won't get a bus back to Ridgeville.

289
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,846
Maybe I'll go someplace else.

290
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:17,848
Maybe in another direction.

291
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:20,975
Chicago or further west, maybe.

292
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,951
- Have you ever been out West before?
- Yeah.

293
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:27,057
I've never.

294
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,894
But maybe I will.

295
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:33,758
What's it like?

296
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:36,828
Big.

297
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,524
- Well, do you want to go back?
- I can't go back there.

298
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:06,163
I'll have to go someplace else.

299
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:09,130
Do you drink, Sam?

300
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,566
- Yes, I drink.
- I'll buy you one.

301
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:13,896
Okay.

302
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,710
Too bad, you want me to check your bag
in the station here?

303
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,005
Too bad, you want me to check your bag
in the station here?

304
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,375
I don't know. I guess I'll want it at a hotel.

305
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,610
- You don't want me to take you there?
- Do you happen to be at the Gable Hotel?

306
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,246
- Yeah.
- Can I go there?

307
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:31,648
It's a public place.

308
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:35,988
Here, tell the clerk that Sam Masterson
wants a room for a young lady.

309
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,619
- She'll register when she gets there.
- Yes, sir.

310
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,357
- Thanks.
- Keep it.

311
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:54,742
Classy. Blue lights, music...

312
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,876
- everything.
- A cafe.

313
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:02,209
When I lived in this town,
there were nothing but saloons.

314
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,618
My father used to live in them.

315
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,925
- Mine, too.
- We're related.

316
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,650
I'll have the same thing you have,
if you don't mind.

317
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:14,391
Scotch. I take a plain water chaser
with that...

318
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:15,898
when the Scotch isn't so good.

319
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,593
Two water chasers.

320
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,897
Did you drive far?

321
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:24,074
About 600 miles since this morning.

322
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:27,170
You weren't driving anything tonight?

323
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,180
No, my Stanley Steamer's in the garage,
having her face lifted.

324
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:35,214
You'd better bring us a couple more
before curfew.

325
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,288
That'll be $2.

326
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,891
- On me.
- Thanks.

327
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,357
Maybe you'd like to drink to
finding your people?

328
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,397
No, my mother wouldn't approve of that.

329
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,900
How would you know after all this time?

330
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:55,234
After all this time you probably
wouldn't care, one way or the other.

331
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:58,405
You talk awful cold-blooded about them,
don't you?

332
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,910
- That's life.
- Is it a big family?

333
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:02,579
No, it wasn't.

334
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:07,448
Besides me, there were just the usual two
people necessary to increase the population.

335
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:11,446
Mother left when I was a baby,
and my father...

336
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:14,582
probably drank himself to death by now.

337
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:18,121
Another man I know talks cold
like that's my Dad.

338
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,056
He's the most cold-blooded man
in Ridgeville.

339
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,324
Once he kicked me.

340
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,394
Gee, it made me sick.

341
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:31,141
I can guess why you didn't break your neck
to catch that bus back to Ridgeville tonight.

342
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:35,008
I probably would have got on
and got off before it started out.

343
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,043
Or I would have got the jitters
the minute I got on.

344
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:43,977
Anyway, it's gone now, for tonight anyhow.

345
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:47,450
There won't be another one
until tomorrow night.

346
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:51,995
And now I know for sure,
I'm not going to make that one either.

347
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:54,854
Not the one to Ridgeville, at least.

348
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:00,933
But I'm so glad you came
to have a drink with me tonight.

349
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,202
I was so lonesome, I like to have died.

350
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:08,603
- Have you ever been that lonesome?
- How lonesome is that?

351
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:11,978
About as much as you can hold
without busting open.

352
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,480
Wanna know how I got that way?

353
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,919
Curfew. Shall we go home?

354
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:23,926
The reason I picked the hotel,
your hotel, it's really very...

355
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,997
You read the hotel advertising
on that when you had it.

356
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,566
You're smart.

357
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:33,267
Maybe you think I've been trying too hard
to get acquainted.

358
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:36,204
- Maybe you have.
- Maybe you think that's wrong.

359
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:38,639
Maybe it's too soon to tell.

360
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,002
I wonder what you're thinking.

361
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,479
I don't think you'll take up too much room
in my Stanley Steamer.

362
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,447
Maybe you're all right.

363
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,952
You think you can hold that thought
all the way to the Coast?

364
00:29:57,762 --> 00:30:00,128
We better wait here for a minute.

365
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:03,563
Hey, I wanna ask you something.

366
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:07,363
Does that guy look like
a scared, little boy to you?

367
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,599
He looks like he's going to cry any minute.

368
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,641
Let's get away from him.

369
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,881
- Is Mr. O'Neil in?
- No, madam, not to my knowledge.

370
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,506
Walter.

371
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,009
Hello.

372
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,656
No words?

373
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:05,358
Can I have a cigarette?

374
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:13,566
- My lady's lips.
- I'll ring for some coffee for you.

375
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:16,834
- No, thank you. I'll have another drink.
- Walter!

376
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:20,604
If there's to be a discussion,
I'll need another drink.

377
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:24,142
Otherwise, I shall neither hear,
nor be coherent...

378
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:28,743
when, and if, I reply to whatever
it is you're about to say.

379
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:32,220
Did you forget
that you were supposed to speak tonight?

380
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:33,950
I didn't forget, I...

381
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:38,485
It' s nice. Your room, I mean.

382
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,090
It's been a long time since I've been here.

383
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,600
- Where were you?
- Getting drunk.

384
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:48,103
- Where?
- I'm still the people's choice, honey.

385
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:51,470
I did not make a public display
of myself anywhere.

386
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:54,442
You realize, of course,
that you will one day, inevitably.

387
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:57,639
- Inevitably.
- It's your career, not mine.

388
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,913
What's mine is yours.

389
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:03,146
Don't you think
I'm entitled to an explanation?

390
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,983
What do you want me to say?

391
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,786
- I don't want to put words in your mouth.
- I'd prefer that you would.

392
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:10,588
All right. When did you get drunk?

393
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:13,721
Where did you get drunk?
Why did you get drunk?

394
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,861
Don't stand over me like that.

395
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:20,569
I'm a sentimental man, Martha.

396
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,804
I started to get dressed...

397
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:28,806
then I realized it was the fourth
anniversary of my father's death.

398
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,273
I thought it would be nice
if I went to the cemetery and...

399
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:37,912
laid a wreath of flowers on his grave.
However, I never got there.

400
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,181
Sentiment overwhelmed me.

401
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:45,758
I stopped off to have a drink
to his sainted memory.

402
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:52,232
As I drank, I thought to myself,
it's such a pity that my father isn't alive...

403
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:56,568
to be able to see for himself
all his dreams come true.

404
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,704
The dreams he worked so hard for.

405
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,838
His son, a famous man.

406
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:11,051
Married to a beautiful and wealthy woman.

407
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,720
All right.

408
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,850
Now tell me why you got drunk?

409
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,157
Because I couldn't get up
and speak before people.

410
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,694
Walter, listen to me, what's done is done.

411
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,533
- The deed's done, not the thought.
- You've got a life to live.

412
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:31,164
- I don't know, I'm not sure.
- A brilliant career.

413
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:34,438
- My father always said that.
- Your father was right.

414
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,979
He was never right about anything.

415
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,913
From the day he walked in
and found your aunt on the floor...

416
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,986
I told you I never want that mentioned.

417
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:46,318
To the day he sat beside you in
the courtroom, as I, the public prosecutor...

418
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:49,222
demanded that the state take the life
of a man...

419
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,727
for the brutal murder of Mrs. Ivers.

420
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:55,890
My father said nothing.
I looked at him, but he said nothing.

421
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:58,532
Your father was a realistic man.

422
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:01,799
My father, may he rest in peace,
was a greedy man.

423
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:04,932
The man they executed was a criminal.

424
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,137
If he hadn't hanged for that,
he would have hanged for something else.

425
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,840
The man was a man. Justice is justice.

426
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,012
That's the way it is. I...

427
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:16,916
I can't get up and speak before people.

428
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:20,050
The words stick in my throat.

429
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:24,687
I'd rather get drunk. I do get drunk.

430
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:29,190
I did get drunk.

431
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,560
Walter, dear, listen to me.

432
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:36,504
If you carry a thing in your mind,
it makes you sick.

433
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:40,201
- I want you well. Tomorrow...
- Will be like today.

434
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:44,238
You will leave on a trip
for your health for a few weeks.

435
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,152
- Will you go with me?
- No.

436
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,110
I'll stay here.

437
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,748
Then, I'll stay here, too.

438
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:55,259
What do you want to do? Give everything
up, is that what you want to do?

439
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,456
What do you want to do? Give everything
up, is that what you want to do?

440
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:00,463
You wouldn't let me do that,
would you, Martha?

441
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:03,159
- Do you want to?
- I don't know, Martha.

442
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:06,597
I ask myself that question all the time.

443
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,468
If my father were alive I could ask him.

444
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,969
Only I know what his answer would be.

445
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,672
He'd say to me, "Keep what you have...

446
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,576
"and make her live up to it."

447
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:24,216
"Make her live up to her bargain."
That's what he'd say.

448
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:26,517
I am living up to it, Walter.

449
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:53,411
There's another drink left,
might as well have it.

450
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,160
The bottle's empty now.

451
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,426
Goodnight, Martha.

452
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:20,833
Tell me, Martha, what shall I do
about my love for you?

453
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:24,037
Tell me, Martha,
why I don't abandon all this?

454
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:29,081
- Why I don't just throw it back in your face?
- You tell me, Walter.

455
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:53,568
- Well, this is it. Not good. Not bad.
- With bath?

456
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:58,680
With bath. And come out, come out,
wherever you are.

457
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:02,651
With bath, hey? There's half as many baths
as there is rooms.

458
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:06,484
Half the rooms has baths, and half hasn't.
That's one way of looking at it.

459
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:10,891
Another is, for each two rooms one has
a bath in the middle and the other hasn't.

460
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:15,694
Or, you might say, there's a half a bath to
each of two rooms.

461
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,798
How was that again, now?

462
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,631
There's half as many baths
as there is rooms...

463
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,035
- and if, and if the two...
- That's all right.

464
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:25,973
I've already sent the boy with those bags
up to your room, Mr. Masterson.

465
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,443
Well, they belong to Miss Marachek, here.

466
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:31,572
They came in my name
because she wasn't registered yet.

467
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:35,110
- I missed my bus to Ridgeville.
- That's too bad.

468
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:44,252
The boy went off at 12:00.
You'll have to manage yourselves.

469
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,728
- I can't leave the board.
- Thanks.

470
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:48,795
Good night.

471
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,498
- Sweet dreams.
- Good night, Cupid.

472
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:58,331
Twenty-five. Your room number's 25, I'm 23.
Makes us neighbors.

473
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:15,015
Why did you buy a ticket to Ridgeville,
if you didn't want to go back home?

474
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:16,660
I didn't.

475
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:21,393
I didn't buy the ticket.
I got it, but I didn't buy it.

476
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,940
You all right?

477
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:35,845
- I'm a little cold, maybe.
- Better get out of those wet clothes.

478
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:44,544
I've started your bath for you.
Hurry up, now. I'm next.

479
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:45,815
Thanks.

480
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:17,679
Okay?

481
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,586
I'll loan you a book
for a couple of cigarettes.

482
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,926
If you don't mind what kind of a book it is.

483
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:35,501
That pine soap makes you tingle all over.

484
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:38,403
There's something very personal about soap.

485
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:42,309
- It's almost as personal as a toothbrush.
- I won't use your toothbrush.

486
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:45,678
- Where's your book now?
- You don't care what kind of a book it is?

487
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:48,809
- The suspense is killing me.
- It isn't my book.

488
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:51,746
Somebody here before forgot and left it.

489
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,057
I warned you.

490
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,295
There's one in every room of the hotel.

491
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:08,431
One in practically every room
of every hotel in the world.

492
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,574
It tells all about it there
in the first page or so.

493
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:24,616
- Well, what do you know?
- No, no, no, don't get up.

494
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:30,256
I want to look at you a minute.

495
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,354
That's really a picture.

496
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,660
Throw me a match.

497
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:43,306
- So you're leaving tomorrow?
- Yeah, we're leaving tomorrow.

498
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:48,003
- That is, if the car is fixed.
- Sure you won't mind me being a passenger?

499
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:49,279
No.

500
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:54,217
- Glad of the company.
- Are you gonna stay in the West?

501
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,884
Maybe, maybe not.

502
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,883
You might get lonesome again.

503
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,050
I've been lonesome before. I was
so lonesome tonight, I like to have died.

504
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,991
I know. You mentioned that.

505
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,864
I tried to tell you why.

506
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,958
- Look, I'm going to take a shower.
- I just got out of jail.

507
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:17,137
I just got out tonight.

508
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:22,412
Like I said, we leave tomorrow.

509
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:33,089
I think you'll like that one.

510
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,761
Open up, sonny.

511
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:55,855
Try that door.

512
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:27,756
Good morning, Mr. Masterson.

513
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:32,299
You don't have to show me who you are,
I can tell by the smell.

514
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:35,031
My nose isn't that big. I want to see.

515
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:44,445
The chief sent us up here
to ask you a couple of questions.

516
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:47,410
Sergeant Masterson.

517
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,510
The suspense is killing me.
What do you want to know?

518
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,524
You've been around. Look at that.

519
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:56,420
Africa, Anzio and Normandy.

520
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:59,093
Why don't you wear that button
in your coat?

521
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:02,427
For the same reason you don't wear
your badge. I like it incognito.

522
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,024
- Now what else do you want to know?
- What we wanted to know...

523
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:08,901
this layout told us.
There ain't nothing you can add to it.

524
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:21,040
- She didn't get in an accident, did she?
- She's in the can for a nice long stretch.

525
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:23,346
- What's the charge?
- Violation of probation.

526
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,081
- Probation? For what?
- Theft.

527
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:28,681
Terms of her probation when she was
released yesterday was that she return...

528
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:29,952
to her home in Ridgeville.

529
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,496
An hour ago we picked her up at the
depot when she tried to cash the ticket.

530
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:36,191
Well, maybe she wanted to go by train.

531
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,325
Maybe she wanted to walk.
There's no law that says she...

532
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:39,868
That's not the reason she gave, wise guy.

533
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:41,301
- No?
- No.

534
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,166
The reason she gave
was that she'd got a job.

535
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:46,208
Said you were her employer.

536
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:48,709
Well, what's wrong with that?

537
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:53,181
Nothing, if you can prove it.
But take a tip from me, bud, don't try it.

538
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:57,146
Jake and me don't like to waste our time
testifying in court.

539
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,812
But we will.

540
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:01,188
So long.

541
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:06,057
Exhibit "A", bud, in case you get stubborn.

542
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:08,188
Hey, now wait a minute, copper.

543
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:13,328
- All right, leave her things alone.
- You want to come along, soldier?

544
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:32,719
The little, scared boy.

545
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:38,626
You're just about to do your old pal
a great big favor.

546
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,534
How do you like the way the election
is going this beautiful morning?

547
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,044
The election's going good every morning.

548
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,613
Look, honey...

549
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:01,377
- Miss...
- St. John.

550
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,918
- St. John.
- Bobbie.

551
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,580
- Better still.
- What can I do for you?

552
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:09,088
- In?
- In, but not yet ready to face the world.

553
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:14,995
- Won't you sit down?
- Look, honey, I'm in kind of a hurry.

554
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,762
- Would you take a note in for me?
- When he buzzes.

555
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:21,863
Here.

556
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:27,538
I'll take calls now.

557
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:39,149
Come in.

558
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:42,790
There's a gentleman to see you,
he says it's very important.

559
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:49,629
Tell him I don't want to... Wait a minute.

560
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:54,435
Never mind. I'll tell him myself.

561
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:03,379
Sammy!

562
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:06,573
- Sammy Masterson.
- Little Walter O'Neil.

563
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,878
We were kids together, Miss St. John.

564
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:12,353
- I wouldn't have known you, Sam.
- I wouldn't have known you, either, Walter.

565
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:16,222
- Only I saw your picture.
- My picture? Yes, of course.

566
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:19,056
I don't want to be disturbed
unless it's very important.

567
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:20,720
Yes, Mr. O'Neil.

568
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:30,837
How long has it been?

569
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:32,966
Seventeen, eighteen years,
something like that.

570
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:35,977
- That long?
- We were just kids, you remember?

571
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,774
The three of us?

572
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,307
The three of us.

573
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,216
Thanks. What's she like, Walter?

574
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,754
- Beautiful. I married her.
- I know.

575
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:48,347
- You've done all right.
- I guess so.

576
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:53,122
- And you, what have you done?
- Knocked around. Seen a lot, I guess.

577
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:56,961
- You know, had some fun, maybe.
- What have you done mostly?

578
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,258
- Lately or mostly?
- Mostly.

579
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:00,997
Gambled.

580
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:04,738
- You mean, gambled?
- Sure, that's my business.

581
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:08,878
Perhaps this is where I should remark
that all life is a gamble.

582
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:11,810
You don't need to bother. I know it.
Some win, some don't.

583
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:14,281
You needn't have made that point.

584
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:18,850
I'm sorry, Sam.
This has been a stuffy conversation. I...

585
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:21,054
Would you like a drink?

586
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:25,558
Isn't it a little early in the morning?
I haven't even stopped for breakfast yet.

587
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:29,029
- The occasion.
- You talked me into it.

588
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,558
Fine. Fine.

589
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,568
Nice of you to look me up, Sam.

590
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:36,662
Well, I wouldn't have bothered you,
Walter, only...

591
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,203
I met a girl and you can help.

592
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:43,578
You don't look like you need help
with any girl.

593
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,376
This trip out, I do. This kid's in jail.

594
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:50,113
- What's the charge?
- Violation of probation.

595
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:54,451
- Name is Toni Marachek.
- That's not easy to square, Sam.

596
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:56,719
You can do it. And you will.

597
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,592
For old time's sake.

598
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:03,130
- For old time's sake.
- Thanks.

599
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:08,268
Excuse me.

600
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:16,568
- <i>Mrs. O'Neil is here to see you.</i>
- Please have her wait.

601
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:19,810
She usually drops in on her way downtown.

602
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:21,884
I'd like to see her.

603
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:26,913
- Have Mrs. O'Neil come in.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

604
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:33,927
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were busy.
I'll wait.

605
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,261
- Hello.
- Hello.

606
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,357
The name is Masterson, Sam Masterson.

607
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,131
I'm sorry, I...

608
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:49,135
Sammy Masterson.

609
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:53,708
Hello!

610
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:56,809
Well, I'll do that again. Hello!

611
00:50:57,454 --> 00:51:00,446
- You should have called me.
- He just came in.

612
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:04,325
Well, you've grown to be a big boy, Sam.

613
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:07,192
I always was big for my age,
you remember?

614
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:11,200
- Yes, I remember.
- Anything else you remember?

615
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:14,697
Well, there are lots of things.

616
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:19,572
I never figured that a skinny little mutt
would grow up so beautiful.

617
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:23,510
- I thank you, for my wife.
- Sounds funny.

618
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:27,342
- What does?
- Your saying, "my wife."

619
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:29,779
Does it?

620
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:32,286
Now, don't get sore, Walter. I mean...

621
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,516
Well, I've always thought of Martha as...

622
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:37,252
You know how it is.
You keep something in your mind, since...

623
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,987
the time you were a kid.

624
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:43,396
- How long are you staying, Sam?
- That all depends on our district attorney.

625
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:48,063
- I may have to pull out in a couple of hours.
- Why, that's too bad.

626
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:50,036
That's the way things are, you know.

627
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:57,205
- I don't want to be disturbed.
- That's all right, Walter.

628
00:51:57,314 --> 00:52:01,045
You're a busy man, so I'll blow.
And thanks. Thanks for everything.

629
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,044
So long, Martha.

630
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:09,317
Aren't you glad now
you missed that circus train?

631
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:12,791
- I don't know.
- Where can I reach you, Sam?

632
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:16,888
The Gable Hotel. And, you will do that
for me, won't you, Walter?

633
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,498
- I'll try my best.
- You do that.

634
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:23,104
- And here's hoping you win that election.
- Thanks.

635
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,737
- I will.
- What? Sure thing?

636
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:29,841
- Ask Martha.
- Sure. Sure thing.

637
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:31,646
What odds are you giving him?

638
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:34,273
- A sure thing is never a gamble.
- No?

639
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,886
What odds will you give that that's a fact?

640
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:55,370
- Breezy character, Sam.
- Thank you.

641
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:58,664
- Very sure of himself.
- He always was.

642
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:02,233
This is the first time
I've ever seen you off balance.

643
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:06,749
- I wasn't aware of it.
- I was.

644
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:11,921
- It came as a shock.
- Yes, it did. To me, too.

645
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:17,792
"Sam will never tell."
I'll never forget you saying that.

646
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:21,352
- What makes you think he will?
- What makes you think he won't?

647
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,735
- How long has he been here?
- He came in last night.

648
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:30,033
Did he tell you much about himself:
Where he's been? What he's been doing?

649
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,608
I thought you'd ask what he wanted.

650
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,512
- What does he want?
- He's playing it smart.

651
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,441
Sam was always a smart boy.

652
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:43,951
All he wanted was for me to get his girl
out of jail.

653
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:47,352
- His girl?
- That's what he said he wanted.

654
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:51,059
- What do you think he wants?
- What he can get.

655
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:53,652
He's a gambler, a sharp shooter,
an angle boy.

656
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:55,856
They come through my office
by the hundreds.

657
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:58,628
Couldn't you see blackmail in his eyes?

658
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:02,536
- I haven't your experience with criminals.
- You will...

659
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,166
- when Sammy starts to shake you down.
- Release the girl.

660
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:08,574
- Maybe he'll just pick her up and leave.
- Leave?

661
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:10,942
Do you think he'll leave
a touch worth millions?

662
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:14,483
There's only one way you'll find out.
Release the girl.

663
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:18,318
Good-bye, Miss St. John.

664
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:23,587
<i>Yes, Mr. O'Neil?</i>

665
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:26,423
I want a routine check
on a Samuel Masterson, non-resident...

666
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:27,860
registered Gable Hotel.

667
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:31,456
Miss St. John, close the door!
I want a routine check of all garages.

668
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:33,559
One of them has his car. Stay here, please.

669
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,262
I want a check up on all local banks.

670
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:38,569
Get that private detective McCarthy,
and tell him to come right over.

671
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,427
I thought I might improve my mind,
while I waited.

672
00:54:57,427 --> 00:54:57,916
I thought I might improve my mind,
while I waited.

673
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:00,053
Boswell's <i>Life of Johnson.</i>

674
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:04,532
- Surely you didn't expect to wait that long?
- I was just going to look at the pictures.

675
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:07,159
I found your message
when I got back to the hotel.

676
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:08,862
I asked you to phone.

677
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:12,032
I figured you wouldn't mind
if I came in person.

678
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:14,666
- I figured you would.
- Why?

679
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:17,975
You impressed me this morning as a man
who would bet on anything.

680
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:20,311
Almost anything, depending on the odds.

681
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:22,282
I'll bet you'd like to hear
the story of my life.

682
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:25,354
- What do you bet?
- My story against yours.

683
00:55:26,189 --> 00:55:27,713
You got a bet.

684
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:32,257
Let's see, you left here September 27, 1928.

685
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:33,920
We'll start from there.

686
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,897
The exact date.
How come that's so clear in your mind?

687
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,729
Why shouldn't it be?

688
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:44,205
You know, I used to think
this was the swellest spot in the world.

689
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:46,537
But you've really made it just that.

690
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:49,908
It used to be so dark and ugly when she...

691
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,537
I hate it.

692
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:57,410
Come on, I'll show you what I've done
with the rest of the house.

693
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,580
Okay, fine. I haven't been
on a rubber-neck tour in years.

694
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:04,148
Soon after my aunt died the executors
of the estate wanted to close the house...

695
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,229
- and send me to school, but Mr. O'Neil...
- Mister?

696
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:11,091
You're kind of formal about your husband,
aren't you?

697
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,828
No, I was speaking about his father.

698
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:15,769
- Mr. O'Neil was my tutor, you remember?
- Oh, yeah.

699
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,773
After my aunt died,
he and Walter lived here.

700
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:22,602
- That was cozy.
- This is Walter's room.

701
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:25,314
Rich.

702
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:27,913
Very rich.

703
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,952
Well, you lived here all the time, then?

704
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:35,720
Except for the few years I went to college.
Mr. O'Neil...

705
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:38,123
Walter's father. Walter's father
thought it would be...

706
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,219
good for me to get away for awhile.

707
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:45,164
Mr. O'Neil, Walter's father, he sort of
took care of everything didn't he?

708
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:48,829
- Yes. Yes, he took care of everything.
- You didn't like that?

709
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:51,736
- Let's talk about something else.
- What do you want to talk about?

710
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:53,331
Pick a subject.

711
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:55,475
This is the dining room.

712
00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:58,581
Isn't it kind of crowded?

713
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:03,515
All right. I pick Walter as my subject.
When did you marry him?

714
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:05,921
- When or why?
- I asked when.

715
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:08,582
- When I finished school.
- All right.

716
00:57:08,691 --> 00:57:10,784
Now, why did you marry him?

717
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:13,686
- Pick another subject.
- It's your turn.

718
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:15,094
You.

719
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:17,530
An open book.

720
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:21,468
I went out of this town with the circus,
the one you were supposed to go with.

721
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:25,302
Made friends with the animals
and lived happily ever after. Almost.

722
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:28,108
- Almost?
- Yeah.

723
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:31,009
I got ambitious and that tore it, but good.

724
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:34,242
I got so I wasn't satisfied just
being friendly with the animals.

725
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:38,218
I got so I wanted to own the animals.
So I bought some animals.

726
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:40,687
Well, my lion got the mange
and gave it to the monkeys.

727
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:43,657
The animals became a responsibility
and a liability.

728
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,093
I lost my hard-earned cash
and ran like a thief out of there...

729
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:50,030
with a great yen
to become friendly with people.

730
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,657
Now in that I had some success...

731
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:54,362
me being a gambler,
and people being what they are.

732
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:57,570
Well, that brings us up to my 21st year...

733
00:57:57,674 --> 00:58:00,040
when I became a man officially.

734
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:03,135
How did it feel to become a man officially?

735
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,810
I felt I'd been there before.

736
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:09,447
How did you feel
about becoming a woman officially?

737
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:12,280
I felt I'd been there, too.

738
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,122
Why, this is the room that you...

739
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:23,430
Do you remember, Sam?

740
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,826
- Do I.
- It's the only room I didn't change.

741
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:33,033
It seems that only yesterday
I came through that window.

742
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:35,702
We were going to run away together
that night.

743
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:38,070
You do remember.

744
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:42,048
Yeah.

745
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:45,651
And it was Walter who let me in.

746
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:50,358
I come here often, Sam.

747
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:53,391
Little girls grow up.

748
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:55,760
But they never get through
playing with dolls.

749
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,959
There was a storm that night,
thunder and lightning.

750
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:01,300
I was afraid of the thunder.

751
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:04,635
Why, in the freight car that night,
you told me you weren't.

752
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:06,436
I didn't want you to know.

753
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,376
I wanted to be like you,
never afraid of anything.

754
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,678
You remember that, too, don't you, Sam?

755
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,848
- Things come back to you.
- Don't say it like that, Sam.

756
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:19,786
Not to make me feel good,
but because it's true.

757
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:23,347
All right, it's true.
We were just a couple of kids.

758
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:27,728
- We're not kids now.
- No, Martha, we're not kids.

759
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,927
No time for dreams.

760
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:34,926
Only one dream, Sam,
and it came true. You're here.

761
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:36,300
So is Walter.

762
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,033
- About Walter and myself...
- Don't tell me...

763
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:41,076
- I want you to understand.
- I understand, Martha.

764
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:44,510
I understood when I saw
both of you together in the office.

765
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:46,013
I watched the way he looked at you.

766
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:49,209
I never saw a guy so nuts
about anybody in my life.

767
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:53,380
- Sam, if you stay in Iverstown...
- Well, I'm not staying in Iverstown.

768
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,588
All right, Sam. What do you want?

769
01:00:01,564 --> 01:00:04,761
- What do I want?
- Yes, why did you come back here?

770
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:08,733
- The road curved, but I didn't.
- Answer me!

771
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:11,234
Hey, now, wait a minute.

772
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,573
You sound like I have to.

773
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:17,002
As a matter of fact,
you sounded just like your aunt used to.

774
01:00:17,747 --> 01:00:20,238
- Don't say that to me. Don't ever...
- Look, baby...

775
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:22,875
I won't be around long enough to repeat it.

776
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:26,422
As soon as a certain young lady
is out of your husband's clink...

777
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:29,548
and my car's out of
Dempsey's alleged garage...

778
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:31,325
I'm headed west.

779
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:34,487
- I think you really mean that.
- Any objections?

780
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:37,425
No. No objections.

781
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:43,001
- I should have known if I remembered.
- You should have known what?

782
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:46,306
You. That you'd be like this.

783
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:49,843
I'm sorry.

784
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:53,080
Sorry that you ever left here.

785
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:01,452
Sam, for old time's sake?

786
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:07,963
Yeah. Sure. For old time's sake.

787
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:20,205
Bye, Martha.

788
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:29,214
Dempsey's garage.

789
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:31,511
Yes, Mrs. O'Neil.

790
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:35,079
- Mrs. Walter O'Neil?
- Yes, ma'am.

791
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:42,291
Well, it was a rush job anyway,
and I'm rushed enough as it is.

792
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:45,629
Don't mention it.
Glad to be of service, Mrs. O'Neil.

793
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:50,739
You can add this to your report.

794
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:54,235
Mrs. O'Neil, don't like this guy to go.

795
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:57,939
- Not yet.
- All right, Dempsey. Thanks.

796
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:07,045
- Drink?
- Thanks.

797
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:09,084
There's not much to report on him, locally.

798
01:02:09,192 --> 01:02:10,921
The out-of-town reports are still coming in.

799
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:13,154
You'll have a complete file on him
in a couple of hours.

800
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:16,060
- What's he look like so far?
- He's a big shot gambler.

801
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:19,396
Broke many times,
but always turns up with a new bankroll.

802
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:23,632
The police in every state have tried to find
the source of his money, but no dice.

803
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:27,403
Many arrests, no convictions.
Beat a murder rap in Frisco.

804
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:28,602
Self-defense.

805
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:30,406
Has a war record few can equal.

806
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:33,971
- The car in Dempsey's garage?
- The ownership certificate says he owns it.

807
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,948
- What's wrong with it?
- Smashed radiator.

808
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:38,179
How long will it take to fix it?

809
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:39,652
Well?

810
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:51,325
Who did Dempsey get this call from?
Didn't you check that?

811
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:53,827
- Yes, I checked it.
- Then who was it?

812
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:56,069
Mrs. O'Neil.

813
01:02:58,274 --> 01:02:59,707
That's all.

814
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:05,171
<i>Yes, Mr. O'Neil?</i>

815
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:08,842
Get me the county jail. I want the
Superintendent of the Women's Division.

816
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:15,054
- Yes?
- <i>I have the county jail for you, Mr. O'Neil.</i>

817
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:16,989
<i>Deputy Elizabeth Baker is on.</i>

818
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:21,187
Hello. That girl,
the one I called you about before.

819
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:24,727
Yes. Bring her out here at 8:00.

820
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:26,165
I want to talk to her.

821
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:35,972
You got the time, bud?

822
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:38,637
- Yeah. It's five after eight.
- Thanks.

823
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:41,376
I'm expecting my friend out
in a few minutes.

824
01:03:42,251 --> 01:03:45,118
Say, I ain't seen your face
around here before.

825
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:46,916
No. I'm a stranger here.

826
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:49,082
Then you ain't waiting for anybody, huh?

827
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,687
She's a stranger, too.

828
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:55,423
Yeah, she was due out
a couple of hours ago.

829
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,363
You're in a lot of trouble, Miss Marachek.

830
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:07,442
The law is very specific
on violation of probation.

831
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:09,477
It's specific about everything.

832
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,170
You're serving a five-year sentence.

833
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:14,749
- So I was told once before.
- You lied when you were picked up.

834
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,046
You told the police,
you were employed by Sam Masterson.

835
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:19,417
You think they would've believed me,
if I'd told the truth?

836
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:22,582
- Did you cook up that story between you?
- He had nothing to do with it.

837
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:25,516
You're very fond of him, aren't you?

838
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:28,862
You wouldn't want anything
to happen to him.

839
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:31,225
Does he feel the same about you?

840
01:04:32,768 --> 01:04:35,896
You wouldn't want to serve out
that five-year sentence, would you?

841
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:40,170
- What are you getting at?
- Remember, five years.

842
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:43,541
And this time you'll have to serve
every day of it.

843
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:46,909
You don't have to.

844
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:51,781
All right. Get down to it.
What do I have to do?

845
01:05:11,706 --> 01:05:12,900
Toni!

846
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,169
Toni.

847
01:05:17,913 --> 01:05:18,880
Toni.

848
01:05:19,114 --> 01:05:20,240
Hello, Sam.

849
01:05:20,348 --> 01:05:22,782
O'Neil phoned me,
told me you'd be out at 6:00.

850
01:05:22,884 --> 01:05:24,784
- O'Neil?
- Yeah. Sure. The district attorney.

851
01:05:24,886 --> 01:05:28,287
He's an old friend of mine. I asked him
to do me a favor and here you are.

852
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:30,017
You're late, but free.

853
01:05:30,125 --> 01:05:32,150
There was a mix-up. They lost some papers.

854
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:34,194
I got worried about you.

855
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:36,962
What's the matter, kid?

856
01:05:37,065 --> 01:05:38,157
Toni.

857
01:05:38,733 --> 01:05:40,098
Look at me.

858
01:05:41,636 --> 01:05:43,194
I'd like a drink.

859
01:05:43,305 --> 01:05:46,502
You're a cinch.
I'll buy you a dozen. Hey, taxi!

860
01:05:46,608 --> 01:05:49,873
I'm going to toss you
a real coming-out party. Hey, taxi!

861
01:06:01,056 --> 01:06:02,250
Thanks.

862
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:07,462
Spaghetti.

863
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:13,895
- That looks wonderful!
- I think you'll like it.

864
01:06:17,305 --> 01:06:18,567
Go ahead. Eat.

865
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:22,443
I guess I'm not hungry.
My stomach's in a knot.

866
01:06:23,545 --> 01:06:25,240
Here, this ought to help.

867
01:06:25,814 --> 01:06:27,941
I'd have died, if I had to stay on in jail.

868
01:06:28,049 --> 01:06:29,914
Forget it now. You're out.

869
01:06:30,018 --> 01:06:32,077
If you'd ever been in,
you'd know what I mean.

870
01:06:32,187 --> 01:06:33,677
I know what you mean.

871
01:06:34,823 --> 01:06:38,486
A couple of times last night
I tried to tell you why I did time.

872
01:06:39,261 --> 01:06:41,058
- You wouldn't listen.
- I don't want to now.

873
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:43,358
Now you've got to. Please?

874
01:06:43,465 --> 01:06:46,093
All right, if it'll make you feel any better.

875
01:06:46,201 --> 01:06:48,669
I want to be sure you understand.

876
01:06:49,104 --> 01:06:52,699
One to five, they gave me.
One to five years, that is.

877
01:06:52,807 --> 01:06:55,173
- That's a long jolt.
- It's forever.

878
01:06:56,077 --> 01:06:58,875
I did three months before I came to trial.

879
01:06:59,047 --> 01:07:01,379
It can happen to the best of people.

880
01:07:01,483 --> 01:07:05,385
I'm not the best of people.
I'm just Toni Marachek.

881
01:07:07,155 --> 01:07:10,682
"Where'd you get the fur coat, Toni?"
the judge asked me.

882
01:07:10,792 --> 01:07:12,191
"I met a guy," I told him.

883
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:15,058
"He said he was in love with me.
He gave me the coat."

884
01:07:15,163 --> 01:07:17,461
"A likely story," he said.

885
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:19,557
I said, "But it's true, every word of it.

886
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:24,196
"I tried to pawn it because I needed
the money." "Where's the man?" he asks.

887
01:07:24,739 --> 01:07:26,229
"I don't know," I said.

888
01:07:26,341 --> 01:07:29,469
"He took a powder. He blew.
He flew to the moon."

889
01:07:30,979 --> 01:07:33,243
"You don't fly, Toni," the judge says.

890
01:07:34,182 --> 01:07:36,980
"The charge is theft. You do one to five."

891
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,984
How come they gave you probation?

892
01:07:41,089 --> 01:07:42,750
First offense.

893
01:07:42,857 --> 01:07:44,825
You know what probation is?

894
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:48,120
Yeah, sure. A knife sticking in your back.

895
01:07:53,835 --> 01:07:57,327
Still looking out for the cops?
Relax, now you're free.

896
01:07:57,973 --> 01:07:59,668
I don't feel so good.

897
01:07:59,808 --> 01:08:01,605
Do you want me to take you
back to the hotel?

898
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:03,302
No, no, please.

899
01:08:04,412 --> 01:08:05,879
Let me sit here awhile.

900
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:15,687
Yeah?

901
01:08:18,393 --> 01:08:20,054
- Get your coat on.
- What's the gag?

902
01:08:20,161 --> 01:08:21,822
- Get your coat.
- All right, Joe.

903
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:23,454
What's the gag?

904
01:08:23,565 --> 01:08:27,092
I was up to your hotel.
Nice layout you got there.

905
01:08:27,202 --> 01:08:29,796
Double rooms, connecting doors
and tall glasses.

906
01:08:29,904 --> 01:08:32,395
What did this guy tell you
he'd give you when he picked you up?

907
01:08:32,507 --> 01:08:34,668
All right. There don't have to be
any trouble. Forget it.

908
01:08:34,776 --> 01:08:36,573
She's my wife.

909
01:08:41,116 --> 01:08:43,346
Well, brother, you can have her.

910
01:08:43,852 --> 01:08:45,183
In spades.

911
01:08:47,722 --> 01:08:50,555
Now beat it. You, too.

912
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:52,286
I just want to make sure.

913
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:55,921
- Joe, there don't have to be no trouble.
- No, there don't have to be no trouble.

914
01:08:56,031 --> 01:09:00,058
There's got to be. Certain wise guys
have to be taught a lesson.

915
01:09:00,168 --> 01:09:03,569
- Certain wise guys have to be...
- Where do you want it, here or outside?

916
01:09:03,905 --> 01:09:06,271
Outside will do me fine.

917
01:09:06,374 --> 01:09:08,865
There's an alley through the kitchen door.

918
01:09:09,344 --> 01:09:11,471
- Sam!
- Shut up.

919
01:09:17,352 --> 01:09:18,717
Stay here.

920
01:09:42,811 --> 01:09:45,837
Okay, sister. You did a swell job.

921
01:09:47,048 --> 01:09:48,310
Now blow.

922
01:09:50,985 --> 01:09:52,452
Yes, sir.

923
01:11:44,999 --> 01:11:46,796
What happened to you?

924
01:11:46,901 --> 01:11:49,802
Not a thing.
I'm just made up for Halloween.

925
01:12:27,108 --> 01:12:29,702
Go ahead, bud. She'll catch the next one.

926
01:12:40,221 --> 01:12:43,384
Cut that.
Crying is not going to get you anywhere.

927
01:12:43,491 --> 01:12:44,890
I'll stop.

928
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:46,790
I ought to beat it out of you.

929
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:49,693
- I think maybe I got it coming.
- Why? Why? Why?

930
01:12:49,797 --> 01:12:52,095
Last night in that restaurant,
I kept trying to tell...

931
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,428
Come on! Get down to it.

932
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:55,730
Before they let me out
they took me to the D.A.'s office.

933
01:12:55,837 --> 01:12:58,635
- O'Neil? His name's Walter O'Neil.
- That's right. That's his name.

934
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:01,265
- They took you to his office.
- He asked me a lot of questions.

935
01:13:01,376 --> 01:13:02,604
Mostly about you.

936
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:04,803
- About me?
- About you and me.

937
01:13:04,913 --> 01:13:06,073
- Yeah?
- He kept asking me...

938
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:08,774
if I knew why you came here.
He asked me that a couple of times.

939
01:13:08,883 --> 01:13:11,113
- What else?
- A lot of questions. I forget.

940
01:13:11,386 --> 01:13:13,718
- Remember!
- My head's mixed-up.

941
01:13:13,821 --> 01:13:15,789
Well, the goons,
the ones who worked me over?

942
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:19,382
They just wanted to scare you.
O'Neil doesn't want you in town.

943
01:13:19,494 --> 01:13:21,860
They said if I didn't play with them
I'd go back to jail.

944
01:13:21,963 --> 01:13:22,987
Who said that, O'Neil?

945
01:13:23,097 --> 01:13:25,725
No, no, the other man.
Mr. O'Neil wasn't there by then.

946
01:13:25,833 --> 01:13:27,027
Cute kid.

947
01:13:27,135 --> 01:13:28,762
They said they wouldn't hurt you.

948
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:29,894
Much.

949
01:13:30,004 --> 01:13:32,063
"No more parole," they said, if I went for it.

950
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:35,034
I'd "do the whole five," they said, if I didn't.

951
01:13:35,643 --> 01:13:37,110
I went for it.

952
01:13:37,879 --> 01:13:40,370
Go ahead and hit me, Sam.
I've got it coming.

953
01:13:47,322 --> 01:13:50,086
The only thing you've got coming, kid,
is a break.

954
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:53,590
- I'm going back to town.
- They don't want you here, Sam.

955
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:55,185
- I don't know what it is...
- They got me.

956
01:13:55,296 --> 01:13:56,763
Whether they like it or not, they got me.

957
01:13:56,864 --> 01:13:58,832
- Next time it'll be worse.
- Look!

958
01:13:58,933 --> 01:14:02,699
I don't like to get pushed around. I don't
like people that like to be pushed around.

959
01:14:02,804 --> 01:14:05,136
I don't like anybody to get pushed around.

960
01:14:08,343 --> 01:14:11,437
Kid, I'll tell you what you do.

961
01:14:15,683 --> 01:14:19,016
You grab the next bus out.
I'll meet you, wherever you say.

962
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,088
I'll go back with you.

963
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:26,324
Good. I wanted you to say that.

964
01:14:37,071 --> 01:14:38,936
Just a moment, sir.

965
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,133
Take me to Mr. O'Neil
and you won't get hurt.

966
01:14:41,242 --> 01:14:44,370
Yes, Mr. Masterson.
I hardly recognized you, sir.

967
01:14:48,549 --> 01:14:51,211
Tell your man to ask Martha
to come down here.

968
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:54,154
Tell Mrs. O'Neil that, John.

969
01:15:01,496 --> 01:15:04,226
I thought we ought to have a little talk.

970
01:15:04,332 --> 01:15:06,766
Who'll kick off first? Your team or mine?

971
01:15:06,868 --> 01:15:09,928
You look terrible, Sam. Have a drink.

972
01:15:11,406 --> 01:15:12,600
Thanks.

973
01:15:21,249 --> 01:15:22,477
My hand!

974
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:51,671
"The report on Sam Masterson."

975
01:16:06,294 --> 01:16:08,762
Here, take this. I'm two up on you.

976
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:10,957
Thanks.

977
01:16:11,065 --> 01:16:14,557
You're out of shape, Walter.
For a minute there I thought you were dead.

978
01:16:15,136 --> 01:16:16,330
I was.

979
01:16:18,139 --> 01:16:21,506
- I wasn't going to shoot.
- I wasn't going to wait and see.

980
01:16:21,609 --> 01:16:22,871
Come on.

981
01:16:25,813 --> 01:16:29,010
I took a gander at this while you were out.

982
01:16:30,351 --> 01:16:34,412
I could have given you a much more
detailed picture on Sam Masterson.

983
01:16:34,522 --> 01:16:36,353
I didn't know you cared.

984
01:16:37,725 --> 01:16:39,317
You know it now.

985
01:16:41,362 --> 01:16:44,525
- Now I'll let Martha give it to you.
- Give him what, Sam?

986
01:16:44,632 --> 01:16:47,567
The facts concerning a guy
called Sam Masterson...

987
01:16:47,668 --> 01:16:51,399
and his attitudes towards life and love.
Walter's got the wrong ideas.

988
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:54,066
- Sam, you're hurt.
- You ought to see the other guy.

989
01:16:54,175 --> 01:16:56,439
- What happened?
- This.

990
01:16:57,111 --> 01:17:00,274
It fell out of a guy's pocket
and hit me in the face.

991
01:17:00,381 --> 01:17:01,780
Private dicks.

992
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:04,584
What's the trouble, Walter?
Don't you trust your own cops?

993
01:17:05,486 --> 01:17:06,953
You're right, Sam.

994
01:17:07,054 --> 01:17:10,490
I hired the man who worked you over.
The idea was mine.

995
01:17:10,758 --> 01:17:14,558
I thought it might scare you
into not coming back. It hasn't.

996
01:17:15,596 --> 01:17:18,463
We're ready to listen to the
current quotation on blackmail.

997
01:17:18,566 --> 01:17:19,931
- Walter!
- Blackmail?

998
01:17:20,034 --> 01:17:22,696
I said blackmail. Now, what is the price?

999
01:17:23,771 --> 01:17:26,740
Remember you are dealing
with two old friends.

1000
01:17:29,110 --> 01:17:31,510
- Which one of you do I deal with?
- With me.

1001
01:17:31,612 --> 01:17:33,671
Be at my office at the plant at 3:00.

1002
01:17:33,781 --> 01:17:34,873
Okay.

1003
01:17:37,485 --> 01:17:40,283
May the deal be profitable, to all of us.

1004
01:17:40,388 --> 01:17:43,755
Whatever the price is, that's it, Sam.
Don't try this again.

1005
01:17:44,692 --> 01:17:48,423
What happened last night
can happen again, and worse.

1006
01:17:50,097 --> 01:17:52,065
Don't try it, sweetheart.

1007
01:17:52,867 --> 01:17:54,732
I'll make this a flat statement.

1008
01:17:56,671 --> 01:17:58,104
I'll kill you.

1009
01:18:08,449 --> 01:18:10,178
Hold your hand under the water.

1010
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:18,221
Now dry your hand.

1011
01:18:23,898 --> 01:18:25,229
This will hurt.

1012
01:18:27,134 --> 01:18:30,900
- Even pain at your hands.
- You were lucky.

1013
01:18:31,305 --> 01:18:34,672
- Yes, I'm a very lucky man.
- And a stupid one.

1014
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:38,974
Yesterday afternoon he told me he didn't
want anything. That he was going away.

1015
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:42,413
- lf you had let me handle it...
- I didn't like what you had in mind.

1016
01:18:43,784 --> 01:18:47,276
It's quite a thing, in a small city like this,
to be a district attorney.

1017
01:18:48,556 --> 01:18:51,582
You get to feel like God.
You know everything.

1018
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:54,252
Down to the smallest detail.

1019
01:18:55,162 --> 01:18:57,528
Even a call to Dempsey's garage.

1020
01:18:59,133 --> 01:19:01,328
Sam's leaving Iverstown today.

1021
01:19:02,236 --> 01:19:04,363
- That's what he said.
- I want to hear you say it.

1022
01:19:04,472 --> 01:19:06,633
- It's up to him.
- No, it's up to you.

1023
01:19:06,741 --> 01:19:09,676
I know you, Martha. You are my life's work.

1024
01:19:09,777 --> 01:19:11,938
I've studied you all these years.

1025
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:15,945
A little girl in a cage,
waiting for someone to let her out.

1026
01:19:16,584 --> 01:19:18,279
And along comes Sam.

1027
01:19:19,153 --> 01:19:22,122
Do you know what's on my mind, Martha.
About Sam, I mean?

1028
01:19:23,324 --> 01:19:27,055
I think I do. And that's where it will stay.
On your mind.

1029
01:19:28,496 --> 01:19:31,294
Unless, of course, I tell you differently.

1030
01:19:33,668 --> 01:19:36,262
What did O'Neil say?
Do you think he'll make trouble?

1031
01:19:36,370 --> 01:19:39,464
No, no, I had him figured out right.
He's still just a scared, little kid.

1032
01:19:40,308 --> 01:19:42,139
Coffee, please. Black.

1033
01:19:42,643 --> 01:19:45,271
You know,
Martha's the one I can't dope out.

1034
01:19:45,479 --> 01:19:47,606
- Martha?
- Mrs. O'Neil.

1035
01:19:47,715 --> 01:19:51,116
The three of us grew up together.
I told you about it, remember?

1036
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:54,180
Thanks.

1037
01:19:56,223 --> 01:19:58,589
- What's she like now?
- What do you mean?

1038
01:20:00,194 --> 01:20:02,822
- Is she pretty?
- She's beautiful.

1039
01:20:03,264 --> 01:20:04,663
That's why I can't figure it out.

1040
01:20:04,765 --> 01:20:08,667
Why should a beautiful, rich girl stay
married to a guy she's not in love with?

1041
01:20:08,769 --> 01:20:10,930
- How do you know that?
- I know.

1042
01:20:12,406 --> 01:20:13,808
You sound like you're in love with her.

1043
01:20:13,808 --> 01:20:14,934
You sound like you're in love with her.

1044
01:20:15,042 --> 01:20:17,272
You sound like you're jealous.

1045
01:20:19,847 --> 01:20:21,508
Could be.

1046
01:20:22,616 --> 01:20:26,074
- When are we leaving?
- This evening, if the car is ready.

1047
01:20:26,554 --> 01:20:28,545
What do we do until then?

1048
01:20:28,656 --> 01:20:32,023
I know, why don't we find out
what happened to your people?

1049
01:20:32,927 --> 01:20:35,919
Yeah. That ought to be simple...

1050
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:39,466
now I know I left town September 27, 1928.

1051
01:20:39,567 --> 01:20:41,626
The exact day. How come you remember it?

1052
01:20:41,736 --> 01:20:43,795
Wouldn't you remember a date,
the exact date...

1053
01:20:43,904 --> 01:20:45,531
about something
that happened that long ago?

1054
01:20:45,639 --> 01:20:47,698
No. Not unless something terrific
happened that day.

1055
01:20:47,808 --> 01:20:48,934
Yeah.

1056
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:52,538
Come on, let's finish our coffee.
We'll go down to the newspaper morgue.

1057
01:20:52,646 --> 01:20:53,840
The morgue?

1058
01:20:54,348 --> 01:20:57,374
Yeah. I think I can find out
about my people down there.

1059
01:20:57,518 --> 01:20:59,782
Afterwards, take you shopping.

1060
01:21:05,593 --> 01:21:09,757
That was a strange case.
It went unsolved for years.

1061
01:21:10,931 --> 01:21:14,799
Then one day they picked up a guy
who stuck up a garage or something.

1062
01:21:15,069 --> 01:21:18,232
Someone who used to work
at old lady Ivers' house.

1063
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:22,408
It came out at the trial that he was
the one that knocked the old lady off.

1064
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:25,877
It's my favorite case.
Here's a picture of the guy.

1065
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:28,172
He doesn't look like very much, does he?

1066
01:21:28,282 --> 01:21:30,807
Yeah. Kind of a scared, little rabbit.

1067
01:21:31,318 --> 01:21:34,549
I watched him all through the trial.
Never had a chance.

1068
01:21:34,755 --> 01:21:36,689
O'Neil really did a job on him.

1069
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:38,918
- Is that Walter O'Neil?
- Yep. Same guy.

1070
01:21:39,727 --> 01:21:41,661
It was kind of dramatic, though.

1071
01:21:41,762 --> 01:21:44,822
Him being engaged to the niece
of the murdered woman.

1072
01:21:45,866 --> 01:21:47,390
Sure did a job.

1073
01:21:48,302 --> 01:21:51,100
- The jury was unanimous.
- What happened to him?

1074
01:21:51,205 --> 01:21:53,833
They hung him. Interesting, eh?

1075
01:21:54,275 --> 01:21:56,072
Solving a murder after all those years.

1076
01:21:56,177 --> 01:21:58,168
It's all in the files there,
go ahead and read it.

1077
01:21:58,279 --> 01:22:00,008
Thanks, I will.

1078
01:22:07,621 --> 01:22:10,112
- Yes?
- <i>Mr. Masterson. By appointment.</i>

1079
01:22:10,424 --> 01:22:11,948
Send him in, please.

1080
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:19,732
- 3:00, on the nose.
- On the nose. Come in, Sam.

1081
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:21,233
You should have kept me waiting.

1082
01:22:21,335 --> 01:22:23,929
Big executives always keep people
waiting, didn't you know that?

1083
01:22:24,038 --> 01:22:26,233
- Good executives don't.
- I'll bet you're good.

1084
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:27,705
I am.

1085
01:22:34,248 --> 01:22:37,513
It catches it, doesn't it?
The feeling of a factory?

1086
01:22:38,152 --> 01:22:41,553
When your aunt owned this place,
I couldn't get past the gate.

1087
01:22:41,655 --> 01:22:44,749
Now I'm a guest. Or am I?

1088
01:22:44,859 --> 01:22:46,554
I invited you here.

1089
01:22:46,961 --> 01:22:49,555
Martha, did your aunt leave you everything?

1090
01:22:49,930 --> 01:22:52,057
I was her only heir.

1091
01:22:52,166 --> 01:22:55,863
I'll never forget the way she looked
that night standing in the doorway...

1092
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:58,438
- leaning on her cane.
- I don't want to talk about her.

1093
01:22:58,906 --> 01:23:00,567
Okay. Okay.

1094
01:23:01,342 --> 01:23:05,142
You look different than you did
this morning. Clean and fresh.

1095
01:23:05,246 --> 01:23:09,114
Yeah. Well, it's the perfume
I use that makes me smell so nice.

1096
01:23:10,518 --> 01:23:13,851
I bet I smell as nice as you
and Walter put together.

1097
01:23:14,755 --> 01:23:16,222
What do you want?

1098
01:23:16,323 --> 01:23:19,417
I think I've got what I want.
I think I've got a gimmick.

1099
01:23:20,394 --> 01:23:23,227
A gimmick is an angle that works for you...

1100
01:23:23,330 --> 01:23:26,094
to keep you from working too hard
for yourself.

1101
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,497
Simple.

1102
01:23:27,601 --> 01:23:30,502
- Specifically, what is your angle?
- Specifically?

1103
01:23:31,872 --> 01:23:32,839
Half.

1104
01:23:32,940 --> 01:23:34,999
- Half of what?
- You tell me.

1105
01:23:37,945 --> 01:23:39,469
All right, Sam.

1106
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:44,515
Come here.

1107
01:23:47,388 --> 01:23:49,618
My father used to work here as a mill hand.

1108
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:52,682
So did my father, when he was sober.

1109
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,692
- Now I own it.
- Now you're even.

1110
01:23:56,163 --> 01:23:57,630
Now I'm even.

1111
01:23:58,132 --> 01:24:01,260
I was 21 when I took it over.
It had 3,000 workers then.

1112
01:24:01,569 --> 01:24:03,434
It's got 30,000 now.

1113
01:24:03,537 --> 01:24:07,268
Ran as far as that gate.
Now it goes down to the edge of the river.

1114
01:24:07,374 --> 01:24:09,501
And I did it all by myself.

1115
01:24:09,877 --> 01:24:12,072
Without Walter, without his father.

1116
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:14,847
All by myself.

1117
01:24:16,183 --> 01:24:18,617
Half of this should make quite a score.

1118
01:24:21,722 --> 01:24:23,747
Half would make you my partner.

1119
01:24:24,358 --> 01:24:26,189
That's what I had in mind.

1120
01:24:27,194 --> 01:24:30,652
You went out of here a dirty little kid
once before. That can happen again.

1121
01:24:30,764 --> 01:24:33,597
I don't have to give you anything,
if I don't want to.

1122
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:35,225
But you do want to.

1123
01:24:46,213 --> 01:24:48,875
Hey, Toni! Come in here, quick!

1124
01:24:53,754 --> 01:24:55,016
Yes, Sam?

1125
01:24:56,857 --> 01:24:58,449
- Make a wish.
- I went shopping.

1126
01:24:58,559 --> 01:25:00,151
Any wish. You make it. You got it.

1127
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:02,923
- You feel good.
- Yeah, I'm high. I had a drink.

1128
01:25:03,030 --> 01:25:06,898
- What was in it?
- A bucket of gold. The dice came up seven.

1129
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:10,562
Toni, you bring me luck.
I'm gonna wear you like a charm.

1130
01:25:11,872 --> 01:25:14,340
You really think so, Sam?
You really think I bring you luck?

1131
01:25:14,441 --> 01:25:17,968
I know so, and that's an asset
for a guy in my business.

1132
01:25:18,078 --> 01:25:19,705
Toni Marachek, asset.

1133
01:25:19,813 --> 01:25:23,044
Toni Marachek, good kid.
You stick around, Toni Marachek.

1134
01:25:23,717 --> 01:25:27,153
Now I've got all the luck.
I'm funny that way.

1135
01:25:27,554 --> 01:25:28,816
I say what's on my mind.

1136
01:25:28,922 --> 01:25:31,823
You walk down the street
and a girl asks you for a cigarette.

1137
01:25:31,925 --> 01:25:33,893
And a match and the time.

1138
01:25:34,862 --> 01:25:37,228
- Life is funny.
- That's philosophy.

1139
01:25:37,331 --> 01:25:38,855
It's good, too.

1140
01:25:39,533 --> 01:25:42,229
- You want to know how it is with me, Sam?
- No. Tell me.

1141
01:25:43,103 --> 01:25:44,536
I've told you.

1142
01:25:45,105 --> 01:25:47,198
And even if it's over, quick...

1143
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:50,175
Look, what you don't know, don't talk about.

1144
01:25:54,682 --> 01:25:58,174
I bought a new outfit. I want to show you.
Well, let's take a look at it.

1145
01:25:59,019 --> 01:26:01,487
$8.95. How do you like it?

1146
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:04,782
With you in it...

1147
01:26:06,827 --> 01:26:07,919
Hello, Sam.

1148
01:26:08,662 --> 01:26:10,687
- Toni.
- Yes, Sam.

1149
01:26:11,699 --> 01:26:13,462
I heard you talking.

1150
01:26:13,634 --> 01:26:16,364
Well, even a crummy hotel like this
has a switchboard.

1151
01:26:16,603 --> 01:26:19,197
I have special privileges in this hotel, Sam.

1152
01:26:20,574 --> 01:26:22,007
I own it.

1153
01:26:22,910 --> 01:26:24,810
This is Mrs. O'Neil, Toni.

1154
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:29,010
- Hello.
- So this is the girl?

1155
01:26:30,017 --> 01:26:33,453
Toni's my name. Antonia Marachek.

1156
01:26:34,021 --> 01:26:37,855
The sun-suit looks very well on her, Sam.
She's got just the figure for it.

1157
01:26:37,958 --> 01:26:39,858
She's a very pretty girl.

1158
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:43,487
- I give another show at 8:00.
- In your room or here?

1159
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:48,461
- Toni!
- Yes, Sam?

1160
01:26:49,136 --> 01:26:52,833
- Mrs. O'Neil is sorry she said that.
- I'm sorry I said that.

1161
01:26:53,173 --> 01:26:54,470
Okay, forget it.

1162
01:26:55,042 --> 01:26:57,135
- Toni.
- Yes, Sam.

1163
01:26:58,078 --> 01:27:00,672
I'm going out with Mrs. Neil, on business.

1164
01:27:01,048 --> 01:27:03,346
- That's why you came here, isn't it?
- Yes.

1165
01:27:03,884 --> 01:27:06,079
I'll be back after a little while.

1166
01:27:06,286 --> 01:27:09,187
I got no place to go. I'll be here.

1167
01:27:14,528 --> 01:27:16,962
- I didn't like that.
- I apologized.

1168
01:27:17,664 --> 01:27:19,529
There was ice on your tongue.

1169
01:27:19,633 --> 01:27:21,794
If you want me to say anything else
to her...

1170
01:27:21,935 --> 01:27:24,802
You spoke your piece. Let's get out of here.

1171
01:27:25,105 --> 01:27:27,505
I've never been in a hotel room
like this before.

1172
01:27:27,608 --> 01:27:29,200
I've been in too many.

1173
01:27:29,443 --> 01:27:31,570
Just the way you read about it in books.

1174
01:27:31,678 --> 01:27:34,772
Window shades, Scotch on the dresser...

1175
01:27:36,617 --> 01:27:38,175
Let's stay here, Sam.

1176
01:27:38,285 --> 01:27:40,480
- No.
- Why not? We can order our dinner here.

1177
01:27:40,587 --> 01:27:42,646
I don't like room service.

1178
01:27:45,025 --> 01:27:48,654
- All right, Sam.
- Come on, let's go.

1179
01:27:57,471 --> 01:27:59,735
What's your Toni Marachek really like?

1180
01:28:00,574 --> 01:28:03,042
That's what she asked me about you.

1181
01:28:04,044 --> 01:28:06,205
What are your plans for her?

1182
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:09,408
- She's very independent.
- Hardly.

1183
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:13,515
- How did you meet her?
- We lived in the same house.

1184
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:15,178
- In Iverstown?
- Yeah.

1185
01:28:15,289 --> 01:28:18,747
- When?
- Now. Now and then.

1186
01:28:26,333 --> 01:28:27,698
Well, let's get back to our drinks.

1187
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:37,301
To continue with your Antonia Marachek,
have you other things in common?

1188
01:28:37,411 --> 01:28:41,313
Taxicabs, hotels and Bibles.

1189
01:28:41,915 --> 01:28:45,248
And we don't like some of the same people
and places.

1190
01:28:45,352 --> 01:28:48,446
It all sounds like a very
substantial beginning.

1191
01:28:49,756 --> 01:28:52,247
How long have you known her, really?

1192
01:28:52,559 --> 01:28:56,086
- Since the day before yesterday.
- How long have you known me?

1193
01:28:57,764 --> 01:29:00,733
Martha, I'm not sure
that I've ever known you.

1194
01:29:01,935 --> 01:29:04,495
What do you say?
Let's get down to business.

1195
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,639
Let's get out of here.

1196
01:29:08,942 --> 01:29:10,432
Waiter.

1197
01:29:11,512 --> 01:29:13,503
- Yes, sir.
- Check, please.

1198
01:29:13,614 --> 01:29:14,706
Yes, sir.

1199
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:17,950
Whiskey and soda.

1200
01:29:21,221 --> 01:29:22,688
Thank you, sir.

1201
01:29:24,691 --> 01:29:25,988
- Wait outside.
- Sam, what is it?

1202
01:29:26,093 --> 01:29:27,253
Wait outside.

1203
01:29:42,609 --> 01:29:44,406
Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful!

1204
01:29:45,045 --> 01:29:47,377
Give that back to him when he sobers up.

1205
01:29:47,548 --> 01:29:50,608
Tell him I run an honest book.
I always pay off.

1206
01:29:59,326 --> 01:30:01,692
- I thought I told you to wait outside.
- I wanted to see.

1207
01:30:01,795 --> 01:30:04,628
- You saw.
- You wanted to kill him, didn't you?

1208
01:30:04,898 --> 01:30:07,162
Yes, I did.

1209
01:30:13,507 --> 01:30:15,304
- This the spot?
- Yes.

1210
01:30:16,343 --> 01:30:17,901
I like your car.

1211
01:30:19,212 --> 01:30:22,204
You know what happened to Lot's wife
when she looked back, don't you?

1212
01:30:22,316 --> 01:30:25,114
- What?
- She was turned into a pillar of salt.

1213
01:30:25,786 --> 01:30:29,313
- What happened to Lot?
- He got away. He didn't look back.

1214
01:30:29,423 --> 01:30:30,651
You know your Bible.

1215
01:30:30,757 --> 01:30:34,420
You would too, if you'd spent
as much time as I did in hotel rooms.

1216
01:30:34,528 --> 01:30:37,827
I'll take it up.
Come on. Let's get out of here.

1217
01:30:37,931 --> 01:30:40,331
I love to watch the city from this spot.

1218
01:30:44,671 --> 01:30:46,662
From up here,
it doesn't even look real, does it?

1219
01:30:46,773 --> 01:30:50,504
It's real, very real.
Owning it gives you a sense of power.

1220
01:30:51,311 --> 01:30:53,438
You'd know what I meant if you had it.

1221
01:30:54,548 --> 01:30:57,176
Ivers, Ivers, Ivers. Ivers.

1222
01:30:57,351 --> 01:31:01,082
If anyone asked me my name now,
I'd say it was Martha Smith.

1223
01:31:01,555 --> 01:31:03,386
Say, I smell smoke.

1224
01:31:05,258 --> 01:31:07,226
Better take a look.

1225
01:31:12,466 --> 01:31:14,263
Must have been some kids up here.

1226
01:31:15,302 --> 01:31:17,133
Sam, don't. Let it burn.

1227
01:31:17,237 --> 01:31:20,570
We used to come up here
when we were kids and build a fire.

1228
01:31:23,744 --> 01:31:25,507
Let it burn, Sam.

1229
01:31:26,747 --> 01:31:27,873
Okay.

1230
01:31:35,589 --> 01:31:38,649
In those days,
we used to think that this was real.

1231
01:31:39,092 --> 01:31:40,286
And that...

1232
01:31:42,229 --> 01:31:43,890
That didn't even exist.

1233
01:31:44,631 --> 01:31:47,759
Just now, you looked like Martha Smith.

1234
01:31:47,868 --> 01:31:49,768
If only you hadn't run away.

1235
01:31:50,203 --> 01:31:53,434
I waited for you, I remember
I waited a long time in the rain...

1236
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:55,201
but you didn't show.

1237
01:31:55,308 --> 01:31:57,037
Give me a cigarette, Sam.

1238
01:31:58,045 --> 01:32:00,343
If only you hadn't left town.

1239
01:32:00,447 --> 01:32:02,415
I had no one to turn to.

1240
01:32:05,018 --> 01:32:08,283
- What did you say, Sam?
- Nothing. I didn't say anything.

1241
01:32:09,022 --> 01:32:12,583
When I found out, it was too late.
Much too late.

1242
01:32:13,593 --> 01:32:15,584
One thing led to another and...

1243
01:32:17,764 --> 01:32:19,288
Another what?

1244
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:22,063
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

1245
01:32:22,169 --> 01:32:25,138
No, go ahead, Martha, it will do you good.

1246
01:32:25,372 --> 01:32:28,102
- Another what?
- Where was I?

1247
01:32:28,208 --> 01:32:29,800
One thing led to another.

1248
01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:32,344
It would have been so different,
if you hadn't run away.

1249
01:32:33,914 --> 01:32:36,678
It would have been you instead of Walter.

1250
01:32:38,185 --> 01:32:40,176
Or if you had stopped me.

1251
01:32:41,154 --> 01:32:43,622
When I lifted the cane,
why didn't you stop me?

1252
01:32:43,724 --> 01:32:46,420
You knew how much I hated her.
Why didn't you stop me?

1253
01:32:46,526 --> 01:32:47,754
I wasn't there, Martha.

1254
01:32:47,861 --> 01:32:50,489
And then I stood there after it was over...

1255
01:32:55,602 --> 01:32:56,569
You...

1256
01:32:58,438 --> 01:33:00,963
- You weren't there?
- No, Martha.

1257
01:33:02,342 --> 01:33:05,573
I wasn't there. I left
when your aunt came into the hallway.

1258
01:33:05,679 --> 01:33:09,080
I didn't want to stick around.
I was in enough trouble as it was.

1259
01:33:09,182 --> 01:33:10,843
I never saw what happened.

1260
01:33:10,951 --> 01:33:14,751
I never knew until tonight
about your aunt or that man.

1261
01:33:14,855 --> 01:33:18,882
The one they hung.
The man that you and Walter killed.

1262
01:34:07,507 --> 01:34:09,202
Sam, help me.

1263
01:34:09,309 --> 01:34:10,276
Help me.

1264
01:34:10,844 --> 01:34:14,177
All right, Martha. Tell me. Talk.

1265
01:34:16,416 --> 01:34:17,678
All right, Sam.

1266
01:34:20,887 --> 01:34:23,515
I never imagined
anyone could die so quickly.

1267
01:34:23,857 --> 01:34:26,951
I had always supposed
that wherever I went she would be with me.

1268
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:28,994
That she would never die.

1269
01:34:30,030 --> 01:34:31,895
But it wasn't like that.

1270
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:35,529
I expected to find her
when I went back to my room.

1271
01:34:37,404 --> 01:34:39,395
Later I became frightened.

1272
01:34:39,973 --> 01:34:42,373
The coroner and the police
were sympathetic.

1273
01:34:42,475 --> 01:34:43,737
The doctor very attentive.

1274
01:34:45,045 --> 01:34:48,481
They believed my story.
The one I told Walter's father.

1275
01:34:50,517 --> 01:34:54,476
That night I slept heavily, peacefully.

1276
01:34:54,588 --> 01:34:57,853
How did you sleep the night
after they hung that man?

1277
01:34:57,958 --> 01:35:01,689
It wasn't long when I found out
why Walter's father believed my story.

1278
01:35:02,295 --> 01:35:05,560
It was as if my aunt had never died.
He took her place.

1279
01:35:06,499 --> 01:35:08,399
He wanted to make something of his son...

1280
01:35:08,501 --> 01:35:11,231
and I was tied to them both
from that time on.

1281
01:35:12,539 --> 01:35:15,838
It became so unbearable
that I wanted to tell the truth.

1282
01:35:15,942 --> 01:35:18,342
But he had deliberately
given me such a sense of guilt...

1283
01:35:18,445 --> 01:35:20,777
and had painted such a picture
of what would happen to me...

1284
01:35:20,881 --> 01:35:22,746
that I was crazy with fear.

1285
01:35:24,317 --> 01:35:26,251
He used that fear well.

1286
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:30,155
To increase it,
he made me part of another crime.

1287
01:35:31,658 --> 01:35:34,650
My testimony sent an innocent man
to the gallows.

1288
01:35:36,696 --> 01:35:39,494
And he used that to make me marry Walter.

1289
01:35:41,735 --> 01:35:45,535
Sam, you're not going to go away again!
I want you here, Sam.

1290
01:35:45,639 --> 01:35:49,575
I've lived so much inside of myself,
so choked with wanting something else...

1291
01:35:49,676 --> 01:35:53,942
that lives and breathes. So desperate
for air and room to breathe it in.

1292
01:35:54,047 --> 01:35:57,778
Sam, please! Please stay here, Sam!

1293
01:36:15,769 --> 01:36:17,634
Good night, Martha.

1294
01:36:47,434 --> 01:36:49,425
Toni, are you still up?

1295
01:36:51,604 --> 01:36:53,936
- Toni?
- Yes.

1296
01:36:55,508 --> 01:36:57,533
It's me. It's Sam. Can I come in?

1297
01:36:57,978 --> 01:36:59,036
Yes, Sam.

1298
01:37:05,285 --> 01:37:07,185
Mind if I put your light on?

1299
01:37:07,287 --> 01:37:10,745
In a little while. I was sound asleep.
I've got a headache.

1300
01:37:11,825 --> 01:37:13,292
Okay.

1301
01:37:15,362 --> 01:37:17,330
I've got something to tell you, Toni.

1302
01:37:18,999 --> 01:37:20,193
Yes, Sam.

1303
01:37:39,219 --> 01:37:40,413
Toni.

1304
01:37:47,293 --> 01:37:48,817
You're crying.

1305
01:37:50,530 --> 01:37:52,725
You're crying because you saw...

1306
01:37:53,533 --> 01:37:56,502
You were at the window there
when we drove up.

1307
01:37:59,205 --> 01:38:01,935
Well, that's what I came in to
tell you about, Toni, the...

1308
01:38:02,642 --> 01:38:04,234
Martha and me.

1309
01:38:04,611 --> 01:38:08,547
You didn't have to, Sam.
There were no strings on this deal.

1310
01:38:09,682 --> 01:38:11,411
Well, that's why I wanted to.

1311
01:38:12,118 --> 01:38:15,815
You see, it started a long way back.

1312
01:38:17,023 --> 01:38:19,150
I don't know yet how it's going to finish.

1313
01:38:19,259 --> 01:38:21,318
What do you want me to say?

1314
01:38:21,694 --> 01:38:23,821
- I don't know.
- What do you want me to do?

1315
01:38:23,930 --> 01:38:27,024
- I don't know.
- All you have to do is tell me the truth.

1316
01:38:28,168 --> 01:38:30,864
Like you did when those goons
worked me over.

1317
01:38:34,974 --> 01:38:36,532
Now we're even.

1318
01:38:38,011 --> 01:38:39,842
Now I'm beat up.

1319
01:38:40,914 --> 01:38:43,212
I'm sorry I said that, Toni.

1320
01:38:46,786 --> 01:38:48,048
Look, kid.

1321
01:38:49,722 --> 01:38:52,714
I'm sore at myself, not at you.

1322
01:38:53,426 --> 01:38:55,087
Do you want me to leave?

1323
01:38:56,863 --> 01:38:58,524
Do you want to leave?

1324
01:38:59,699 --> 01:39:01,530
That's up to you, Sam.

1325
01:39:02,635 --> 01:39:04,603
I'm here on a rain check.

1326
01:39:05,271 --> 01:39:08,104
Now, don't put it that way.
You're here because...

1327
01:39:08,675 --> 01:39:10,802
that's the way we wanted it.

1328
01:39:11,211 --> 01:39:12,473
And now?

1329
01:39:14,180 --> 01:39:15,408
I'm not sure.

1330
01:39:18,051 --> 01:39:19,541
I'm just not sure.

1331
01:39:38,404 --> 01:39:41,805
Hello. Gable Hotel?
I want to speak to Sam Masterson.

1332
01:39:42,308 --> 01:39:45,368
- Put that phone down.
- Hello, Sam. This is Walter.

1333
01:39:46,246 --> 01:39:50,080
I know I'm not disturbing you.
Martha just came in.

1334
01:39:51,985 --> 01:39:54,954
- Well, what do you want?
- I want you to come up here.

1335
01:39:55,221 --> 01:39:57,314
Now. Right now.

1336
01:39:57,423 --> 01:40:00,085
- Are you crazy? The servants...
- I gave them the night off.

1337
01:40:00,927 --> 01:40:02,394
You're drunk.

1338
01:40:03,396 --> 01:40:06,229
I've had a lot to drink, but I'm not drunk.

1339
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:09,732
I suppose it would be stupid
to ask where you were.

1340
01:40:09,836 --> 01:40:12,634
- Yes, it would.
- Sam's not leaving, is he?

1341
01:40:12,739 --> 01:40:15,731
- Ask him when he gets here.
- I just got my answer.

1342
01:40:15,842 --> 01:40:18,072
Then there are no more questions.

1343
01:40:18,178 --> 01:40:20,646
No, I know what I need to know.

1344
01:40:21,581 --> 01:40:23,606
Sam, the superman.

1345
01:40:24,250 --> 01:40:27,117
Sam, the dirty, little boy
from the other side of the tracks.

1346
01:40:27,487 --> 01:40:29,045
I'll go and change.

1347
01:40:29,155 --> 01:40:32,591
I wouldn't want him to see me
in the same dress twice.

1348
01:40:40,366 --> 01:40:41,628
Come in.

1349
01:40:47,407 --> 01:40:48,499
Toni.

1350
01:40:50,109 --> 01:40:53,044
- You're leaving, huh?
- There's a bus out in about an hour.

1351
01:40:53,246 --> 01:40:54,508
Toni.

1352
01:40:55,348 --> 01:40:57,748
Sam, it's better this way.

1353
01:41:00,453 --> 01:41:01,715
Look.

1354
01:41:01,821 --> 01:41:04,654
Sam, I came back here with you because...

1355
01:41:05,325 --> 01:41:08,294
you said you didn't like
to be pushed around.

1356
01:41:08,394 --> 01:41:10,624
I liked you when you said that.

1357
01:41:10,997 --> 01:41:14,433
You were looking for trouble,
but it was a good kind of trouble.

1358
01:41:15,435 --> 01:41:17,062
- And now...
- Now what?

1359
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:20,264
Sam, I saw her. You're going to get hurt.

1360
01:41:21,174 --> 01:41:25,941
Leave her, Sam. Leave this town.
Even without me, but leave.

1361
01:41:26,613 --> 01:41:27,910
I can't.

1362
01:41:28,481 --> 01:41:30,540
At least, not just yet.

1363
01:41:34,187 --> 01:41:36,155
You're going to need some money.

1364
01:41:36,522 --> 01:41:39,457
No, thanks. Let's break clean.

1365
01:41:47,267 --> 01:41:49,360
- See you around.
- Yeah.

1366
01:41:52,839 --> 01:41:54,033
Around.

1367
01:42:02,915 --> 01:42:07,352
- Where's Martha?
- Upstairs getting dressed for the occasion.

1368
01:42:08,087 --> 01:42:10,681
We'll go upstairs.

1369
01:42:14,193 --> 01:42:15,990
Why did you call me?

1370
01:42:16,095 --> 01:42:19,531
I've got a riddle, Sam.
Maybe you can help me solve it.

1371
01:42:19,632 --> 01:42:24,365
It's a little riddle called, "What's to be
done about me, Martha, and you?"

1372
01:42:27,173 --> 01:42:31,633
Sounds just like a poem. If it rhymed,
it would rhyme with murder.

1373
01:42:42,889 --> 01:42:46,290
He's drunk. He's been sitting here
drinking all night.

1374
01:42:46,793 --> 01:42:48,784
Draw a chalk line and I'll walk it.

1375
01:42:49,962 --> 01:42:52,795
Or I'll take a mental test,
any question, like...

1376
01:42:53,466 --> 01:42:55,491
what is my object in life?

1377
01:42:55,935 --> 01:42:58,768
- I tried to stop him from calling you.
- You're a wiseacre...

1378
01:42:59,472 --> 01:43:02,703
an angle boy.
You know all the answers, don't you?

1379
01:43:03,109 --> 01:43:04,406
How are you on dreams?

1380
01:43:04,510 --> 01:43:07,206
Then I was glad he called you.
I was frightened of him, Sam.

1381
01:43:07,313 --> 01:43:09,213
She was frightened of me.

1382
01:43:10,416 --> 01:43:12,543
I had a dream, Sam. It was about you.

1383
01:43:13,619 --> 01:43:16,019
In my dream,
you were not a handsome corpse.

1384
01:43:16,122 --> 01:43:17,612
Maybe it was some other guy.

1385
01:43:17,724 --> 01:43:20,488
- In other dreams there were others.
- I told you, he's drunk.

1386
01:43:20,593 --> 01:43:22,618
- Did you say "others?"
- Many others.

1387
01:43:22,729 --> 01:43:24,856
- He's lying.
- Poor little Martha.

1388
01:43:25,331 --> 01:43:28,494
Her life was so empty.
Is that what she told you, Sam?

1389
01:43:28,601 --> 01:43:30,796
I don't want him in here, Sam.
Make him get out.

1390
01:43:30,903 --> 01:43:32,871
Now you're all of them, Sam.

1391
01:43:32,972 --> 01:43:34,701
Every one of them rolled into one.

1392
01:43:34,807 --> 01:43:36,297
- Sam, make him...
- Keep talking.

1393
01:43:36,409 --> 01:43:38,843
- I'm all of them rolled into one.
- Yes.

1394
01:43:39,979 --> 01:43:42,539
You're a gymnasium instructor
in Philadelphia.

1395
01:43:42,648 --> 01:43:45,845
With a muscle for a brain
and a tendency to insipid verse.

1396
01:43:45,952 --> 01:43:49,752
You're a guy, just a guy, named Pete,
in Erie, who smells of fish and sings.

1397
01:43:51,090 --> 01:43:52,751
You're last year's greatest fullback...

1398
01:43:52,859 --> 01:43:56,454
and you flunked your bar exam,
but you wanted to be an industrial engineer.

1399
01:43:56,629 --> 01:43:58,688
You're a guy who came along to fix a tire...

1400
01:43:58,798 --> 01:44:01,358
so well you became a city-paid inspector.

1401
01:44:01,734 --> 01:44:03,463
And you're a lot of others.

1402
01:44:03,569 --> 01:44:06,333
But worst of all you're the one
and only man who shares with me...

1403
01:44:06,439 --> 01:44:09,966
the only claim I have on her. Ask her, Sam.

1404
01:44:10,076 --> 01:44:11,873
Say to her, "Martha, is all this true?"

1405
01:44:11,978 --> 01:44:15,573
What if it is? What did you expect?
She never wanted to marry you.

1406
01:44:15,681 --> 01:44:16,943
If you had any self-respect...

1407
01:44:17,049 --> 01:44:19,415
She married me because she felt
that way I would never tell.

1408
01:44:19,519 --> 01:44:20,986
That's a lie! Your old man forced her!

1409
01:44:21,087 --> 01:44:23,817
How long you expect her
to go on paying off?

1410
01:44:23,923 --> 01:44:25,390
Forever.

1411
01:44:26,092 --> 01:44:28,993
Well, whatever happens to you,
you've got coming.

1412
01:44:29,095 --> 01:44:31,723
What can happen, Sam? Shall I tell you?

1413
01:44:32,865 --> 01:44:34,992
She'll try to get you to kill me.

1414
01:44:35,735 --> 01:44:38,533
Like she got me to send an innocent man
to the gallows.

1415
01:44:38,638 --> 01:44:41,106
I told you the way it was.
It was his father's idea. He...

1416
01:44:41,207 --> 01:44:43,539
Did she tell you how she stood up in
the police station...

1417
01:44:43,643 --> 01:44:45,873
how she looked at the man
without batting an eye...

1418
01:44:45,978 --> 01:44:47,707
how she said, "Yes, that's the man.

1419
01:44:47,814 --> 01:44:49,805
"He's the one who came
into the house that night.

1420
01:44:49,916 --> 01:44:52,476
"He's the man who killed my aunt."

1421
01:44:53,553 --> 01:44:56,351
That even stuck in the throat of my father.

1422
01:44:57,156 --> 01:45:00,387
My poor, dear, departed, greedy father.

1423
01:45:02,161 --> 01:45:06,120
- But he went right on and so did I.
- He's lying.

1424
01:45:06,232 --> 01:45:09,258
- You believe me, don't you, Sam?
- You believe her, Sam?

1425
01:45:10,069 --> 01:45:12,299
Martha, at least tell the truth now.

1426
01:45:12,405 --> 01:45:14,669
Tell how much you were afraid
of an unsolved murder.

1427
01:45:14,774 --> 01:45:16,935
Tell what a threat it was to the power
and the riches...

1428
01:45:17,043 --> 01:45:19,443
that you'd learned to love so much.

1429
01:45:19,846 --> 01:45:22,041
That I'd learned to love, too.

1430
01:45:22,482 --> 01:45:24,507
Tell why I became district attorney.

1431
01:45:24,617 --> 01:45:26,710
Tell why you made me hang that man.
Tell the truth!

1432
01:45:26,819 --> 01:45:28,650
I told the truth! They were like leeches!
Both of them.

1433
01:45:28,754 --> 01:45:30,085
- They wanted everything.
- All I ever wanted was you.

1434
01:45:30,189 --> 01:45:31,178
- Everything you are.
- I'm nothing.

1435
01:45:31,290 --> 01:45:32,689
- Everything you have, I gave you!
- You gave me nothing!

1436
01:45:32,792 --> 01:45:33,986
Then let go!

1437
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:42,995
You're insane.

1438
01:45:44,036 --> 01:45:45,970
You're out of your mind.

1439
01:45:47,006 --> 01:45:48,200
Me, too.

1440
01:45:49,709 --> 01:45:52,872
You see, Sam, how close we really are
to each other?

1441
01:45:52,979 --> 01:45:55,539
Don't break up our happy home.

1442
01:45:55,648 --> 01:45:57,741
It'll have to be you or me.

1443
01:45:58,050 --> 01:46:01,315
And unless you do it now, it'll be you.

1444
01:46:13,766 --> 01:46:16,291
You mustn't think I'm drunk. I'm not.

1445
01:46:18,404 --> 01:46:20,201
It's just that I'm sick.

1446
01:46:22,141 --> 01:46:25,167
Inside of me, I'm sick.

1447
01:46:34,654 --> 01:46:38,283
Martha, help me. Please.

1448
01:46:47,867 --> 01:46:50,631
Sam, you believe me, don't you?

1449
01:47:12,124 --> 01:47:14,456
Now, Sam. Do it now.

1450
01:47:15,227 --> 01:47:17,457
Set me free. Set both of us free.

1451
01:47:17,563 --> 01:47:20,361
He fell down the stairs and fractured
his skull. That's how he died.

1452
01:47:20,466 --> 01:47:22,559
Everybody knows
what a heavy drinker he was.

1453
01:47:23,603 --> 01:47:26,071
Sam, it can be so easy.

1454
01:48:21,894 --> 01:48:24,761
- I thought you loved me.
- I thought I did, too.

1455
01:48:25,665 --> 01:48:29,157
- Now, you hate me.
- Now, I'm sorry for you.

1456
01:48:31,537 --> 01:48:33,835
When I dreamed about you coming back...

1457
01:48:33,939 --> 01:48:36,635
Your whole life has been a dream.

1458
01:48:36,742 --> 01:48:39,336
I thought you'd be the Sam
I knew as a child.

1459
01:48:39,445 --> 01:48:41,310
Martha, you're sick.

1460
01:48:41,414 --> 01:48:43,678
I could run to you when I was in trouble.

1461
01:48:43,783 --> 01:48:45,910
In your mind, I mean,
that's where you're sick.

1462
01:48:46,018 --> 01:48:47,508
And you'd help me.

1463
01:48:47,620 --> 01:48:49,611
So sick that you don't even know
the difference...

1464
01:48:49,722 --> 01:48:51,883
between right and wrong anymore.

1465
01:48:51,991 --> 01:48:55,051
You've killed. It says so in your record.

1466
01:48:55,461 --> 01:48:57,190
I've never murdered.

1467
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:09,366
Are you all right, now?

1468
01:49:11,210 --> 01:49:12,507
All right.

1469
01:49:13,846 --> 01:49:15,837
You fell down the stairs.

1470
01:49:17,717 --> 01:49:19,082
I remember.

1471
01:49:22,488 --> 01:49:25,651
You carried me in here?

1472
01:49:25,891 --> 01:49:27,017
Yeah.

1473
01:49:35,301 --> 01:49:37,235
You had your chance, Sam.

1474
01:49:43,809 --> 01:49:47,506
It's a thin line.
The one between life and death.

1475
01:49:50,182 --> 01:49:53,174
You said I didn't know the difference
between right and wrong.

1476
01:49:53,486 --> 01:49:56,978
What's right for Walter and myself?
For us to tell the truth?

1477
01:49:57,289 --> 01:49:59,018
- I think so, yes.
- And hang for it?

1478
01:49:59,125 --> 01:50:02,060
You wouldn't hang for it.
Not if you confessed. You'd do time, sure.

1479
01:50:02,161 --> 01:50:04,789
Sure, I'll rot in prison for the rest of my life.
And for what?

1480
01:50:04,897 --> 01:50:05,955
- What am I guilty of?
- Murder.

1481
01:50:06,065 --> 01:50:07,965
What were their lives compared to mine?
What was she?

1482
01:50:08,067 --> 01:50:09,932
- A human being.
- A mean, vicious, hateful old woman...

1483
01:50:10,035 --> 01:50:11,400
who never did anything for anybody.

1484
01:50:11,504 --> 01:50:13,165
Look what I've done with what she's left me.

1485
01:50:13,272 --> 01:50:16,207
I've given to charity, built schools,
hospitals, given thousands of people work.

1486
01:50:16,308 --> 01:50:17,400
- What was he?
- Another human being.

1487
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:20,172
A thief, a drunkard, someone who would've
died in the gutter anyway.

1488
01:50:20,279 --> 01:50:21,803
Neither one of them had any right to live.

1489
01:50:21,914 --> 01:50:23,677
You didn't think Walter had, either.

1490
01:50:25,551 --> 01:50:27,246
Good-bye, Martha.

1491
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:29,348
Sam.

1492
01:50:32,324 --> 01:50:34,383
Sam's going away.

1493
01:50:36,428 --> 01:50:39,727
- Did you hear what I said, Walter?
- Yes, I heard you.

1494
01:50:40,499 --> 01:50:42,228
We can't let him go, can we?

1495
01:50:47,339 --> 01:50:49,637
Martha's waiting for your answer, Walter.

1496
01:50:49,742 --> 01:50:52,609
We'd always be afraid of him.
We couldn't live that way.

1497
01:50:52,711 --> 01:50:55,305
We'd be fools to let him go,
knowing so much about us.

1498
01:50:55,414 --> 01:50:57,314
You may have a little trouble
squaring this one.

1499
01:50:57,416 --> 01:50:59,145
You broke into the house.
You demanded money.

1500
01:50:59,251 --> 01:51:01,446
You tried to attack me
and I shot you in self-defense.

1501
01:51:01,554 --> 01:51:05,422
I've a right to kill in self-defense.
That's what the law says, doesn't it, Walter?

1502
01:51:13,999 --> 01:51:17,435
Isn't that what the law says, Walter?

1503
01:51:20,806 --> 01:51:24,333
It'll hold up, Walter.
I'm a man with a police record.

1504
01:51:32,852 --> 01:51:36,652
It's a perfect case,
if you can get Walter to be your witness.

1505
01:51:39,558 --> 01:51:41,253
Do you want to bet?

1506
01:51:51,237 --> 01:51:53,034
I feel sorry for you.

1507
01:51:54,206 --> 01:51:55,696
Both of you.

1508
01:52:21,033 --> 01:52:23,524
- You love him.
- I hate him.

1509
01:52:23,636 --> 01:52:27,003
- That's why you dropped the gun.
- I was afraid.

1510
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:30,400
For the first time in my life, I was afraid.

1511
01:52:31,110 --> 01:52:34,978
I felt you'd no longer stand by me.
That you'd leave me.

1512
01:52:37,349 --> 01:52:39,544
No, Martha, I won't leave you.

1513
01:52:40,286 --> 01:52:41,617
I love you.

1514
01:52:43,155 --> 01:52:46,454
Don't cry, Martha. It's not your fault.

1515
01:52:47,826 --> 01:52:51,227
- It isn't, is it, Walter?
- No, nor mine.

1516
01:52:51,630 --> 01:52:54,690
Nor my father's, nor your aunt's.
It's not anyone's fault.

1517
01:52:55,367 --> 01:52:57,597
It's just the way things are.

1518
01:52:57,703 --> 01:53:00,866
It's what people want
and how hard they want it.

1519
01:53:01,874 --> 01:53:04,536
And how hard it is for them to get it.

1520
01:53:06,745 --> 01:53:09,077
He's near the gate.

1521
01:53:10,349 --> 01:53:12,112
I'm glad he's going.

1522
01:53:13,819 --> 01:53:17,220
- He'll always be here.
- No, he won't, Walter. He won't.

1523
01:53:17,489 --> 01:53:20,117
And he'll never tell. You needn't be afraid.

1524
01:53:20,225 --> 01:53:24,457
And you'll see, things will be different
now between you and me.

1525
01:53:25,931 --> 01:53:26,898
Just like...

1526
01:53:29,301 --> 01:53:31,633
just like nothing ever happened.

1527
01:53:33,238 --> 01:53:35,536
Just like nothing ever happened.

1528
01:53:38,811 --> 01:53:40,574
Will you kiss me, Martha?

1529
01:53:49,922 --> 01:53:51,446
You believe me.

1530
01:54:21,854 --> 01:54:23,651
<i>Ivers, Ivers, Ivers.</i>

1531
01:54:25,090 --> 01:54:26,057
No.

1532
01:54:28,127 --> 01:54:30,789
No, Martha Smith.

1533
01:55:18,043 --> 01:55:19,977
I missed a bus once and I was lucky.

1534
01:55:22,014 --> 01:55:25,973
I wanted to see if I could be lucky twice.

1535
01:55:33,792 --> 01:55:37,284
Don't look back, baby. Don't ever look back.

1536
01:55:39,164 --> 01:55:41,394
You know what happened
to Lot's wife, don't you?

1537
01:55:41,567 --> 01:55:44,536
- Whose wife?
- Sam's wife.

1538
01:55:49,041 --> 01:55:50,770
Sam's wife.
