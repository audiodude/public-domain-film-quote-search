1
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,173
Hello, Duke.

2
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:51,275
Hello, Mike.
Any luck today?

3
00:01:51,352 --> 00:01:53,286
I figured out a swell racket,

4
00:01:53,354 --> 00:01:55,754
and everything was going great
until the cops came along.

5
00:01:55,823 --> 00:01:57,757
Too bad it didn't work.

6
00:01:57,825 --> 00:02:00,123
<i>If them cops would stick
to their own racket,</i>

7
00:02:00,194 --> 00:02:02,128
<i>we'd get somewhere
in this country...</i>

8
00:02:02,196 --> 00:02:04,562
<i>without a lot of this
relief and all that stuff.</i>

9
00:02:04,632 --> 00:02:08,693
Mike, I wouldn't worry.
Prosperity's just around the corner.

10
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:13,229
Yeah. It's been there a long time.
I wish I knew which corner.

11
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:15,867
Well, Duke, I'm gonna turn in.

12
00:02:15,943 --> 00:02:18,343
<i>- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir, Mike.</i>

13
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,958
This is the place, all right.
That looks like one of them.

14
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,961
- Looks pretty tough to me.
- Stall Irene. I'll talk to the fellow.

15
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,725
- I told you about this place.
- We got here first.

16
00:02:36,798 --> 00:02:38,959
Well, she's not gonna
get ahead of me.

17
00:02:41,303 --> 00:02:43,703
Good evening.

18
00:02:45,073 --> 00:02:48,008
- Good evening.
- How'd you like to make five dollars?

19
00:02:48,076 --> 00:02:50,909
Huh? I didn't quite
catch what you said.

20
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:53,174
I said, how'd you like
to make five dollars?

21
00:02:53,248 --> 00:02:55,648
<i>- Five dollars?
- Five dollars.</i>

22
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,743
Well, I don't want
to seem inquisitive,

23
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,913
but what would I
have to do for it?

24
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:03,583
All you have to do is go
to the Waldorf Ritz Hotel with me,

25
00:03:03,658 --> 00:03:06,593
I'll show you to a few people,
and then I'll send you right back.

26
00:03:06,661 --> 00:03:08,595
May I inquire just why
you would want...

27
00:03:08,663 --> 00:03:10,654
to show me to people
at the Waldorf Ritz?

28
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,667
Oh, if you must know,
it's a game... a scavenger hunt.

29
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:18,001
If I find a forgotten man first, I win.
Is that clear?

30
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,132
Yes, quite clear.

31
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,939
Shall I wear my tails,
or come just as I am?

32
00:03:24,012 --> 00:03:27,345
You needn't be fresh. Do you want
the five dollars or don't you?

33
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,940
Madam, I can't tell you
how flattered I am...

34
00:03:30,018 --> 00:03:31,952
by your very generous offer.

35
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,512
However, I'll have to take it up
with my board of directors.

36
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,684
- Don't you touch me!
- No matter what my directors advise,

37
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,058
- I think you should be spanked.
- George, do something!

38
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:43,256
Are you in the habit
of hitting ladies?

39
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:46,323
I'm in the habit of hitting gentlemen
also, if that'll interest you.

40
00:03:46,401 --> 00:03:49,302
- Aren't you going to do anything?
- Let's get a policeman.

41
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:54,468
- Who are you?
- I'm Irene.

42
00:03:54,543 --> 00:03:57,137
That was my sister Cornelia
you pushed in the ash pile.

43
00:03:57,212 --> 00:03:59,806
- Like me to push Cornelia's sister?
- I don't think I'd like that.

44
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:01,906
- Then you'd better get out of here.
- Oh, you bet.

45
00:04:01,983 --> 00:04:03,917
Wait a minute!
Sit down!

46
00:04:03,985 --> 00:04:05,919
I'm sitting.

47
00:04:05,987 --> 00:04:08,751
What's up, Duke?
Need some help?

48
00:04:08,823 --> 00:04:11,917
No, thanks, boys.
Got everything under control.

49
00:04:11,993 --> 00:04:14,359
Are you a member
of this hunting party?

50
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:17,227
I was, but I'm not now.
Are they all forgotten men too?

51
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:19,392
Yes, I guess they are, maybe. Why?

52
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:23,028
I couldn't help but laugh. I've wanted
to do that since I was six years old.

53
00:04:23,104 --> 00:04:26,540
- You wanted to what?
- Oh, push Cornelia in a pile of ashes.

54
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:29,543
That was Faithful George with her.
That isn't really his name.

55
00:04:29,611 --> 00:04:33,012
He gets in everybody's hair.
His father's the broker.

56
00:04:33,081 --> 00:04:35,049
That's very enlightening.

57
00:04:35,116 --> 00:04:38,051
Cornelia thought she was going to win,
and you pushed her.

58
00:04:42,123 --> 00:04:46,059
Could follow an intelligent conversation
for just a moment?

59
00:04:46,127 --> 00:04:48,425
- I'll try.
- Well, that's fine.

60
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,431
Do you mind telling me
just what a scavenger hunt is?

61
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,195
Well, a scavenger hunt
is exactly like a treasure hunt.

62
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:56,863
In a treasure hunt
you try to find something you want.

63
00:04:56,938 --> 00:04:59,873
In a scavenger hunt you try to find
something that nobody wants.

64
00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:02,239
- Hmm, like a forgotten man?
- That's right.

65
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,074
The one that wins gets a prize,
only there really is no prize.

66
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:08,081
It's just the honor of winning.
The money goes to charity.

67
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:11,084
That is, if there's any money left over,
and there never is.

68
00:05:11,152 --> 00:05:14,019
Well, that clears
the whole matter up beautifully.

69
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:17,889
I've decided I don't want to play any
more games with human beings as objects.

70
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:21,156
It's kind of sordid when you think
of it, when you think it over.

71
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:24,426
Yeah, well, I don't know.
I haven't thought it over.

72
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:27,935
I don't like to change the subject, but
why do you live in a place like this?

73
00:05:28,003 --> 00:05:30,267
There's so many
other nice places.

74
00:05:30,338 --> 00:05:33,466
- You really want to know?
- Oh, I'm very curious.

75
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:38,478
Because my real estate agent felt the
altitude would be good for my asthma.

76
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,538
- Oh, my uncle has asthma.
- No!

77
00:05:41,616 --> 00:05:44,346
Well, now there's a coincidence.

78
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:47,252
Well, I suppose I should
be going now, shouldn't I?

79
00:05:47,322 --> 00:05:49,256
That's a good idea.

80
00:05:49,324 --> 00:05:52,350
I want to see who won the game.
I suppose it was Cornelia.

81
00:05:52,427 --> 00:05:54,827
She probably got another
forgotten man by now.

82
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,956
If you took me with you,
you'd win the game? Is that the idea?

83
00:05:58,033 --> 00:06:00,160
Well, I might if I got there first.

84
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:03,102
But after seeing what you did
to Cornelia, I'm not saying anything.

85
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:05,765
But you'd win if you
got back first with me?

86
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,606
It'd be awfully nice of you,
but I don't like to ask.

87
00:06:09,678 --> 00:06:11,873
Let's beat Cornelia.

88
00:06:11,946 --> 00:06:14,881
- It wouldn't be asking too much?
- Mm-mm.

89
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:18,146
See, I've got a sense of curiosity,
just the same as you have.

90
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:21,382
I'd really like to see
just what a scavenger hunt looks like.

91
00:06:21,456 --> 00:06:25,392
- But I told you!
- Yes. I'm still curious.

92
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,190
Well, come on.

93
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:35,725
<i>Thank you.</i>

94
00:06:35,804 --> 00:06:38,967
- My name's Blake.
- My name is Bullock.

95
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,100
The place slightly resembles
an insane asylum.

96
00:06:42,177 --> 00:06:44,407
Well, all you need
to start an asylum...

97
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,743
is an empty room and
the right kind of people.

98
00:06:46,815 --> 00:06:48,749
That's right.

99
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,385
Oh, good evening, Mrs. Jordan.
Look what I brought with me.

100
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,584
Oh, why, look!

101
00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:00,059
- And the baby came along too!
- Here.

102
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,361
Take a look at the dizzy
old gal with the goat.

103
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:08,766
I've had to look at her for 20 years.
That's Mrs. Bullock.

104
00:07:08,837 --> 00:07:10,429
Alexander!

105
00:07:10,505 --> 00:07:12,871
- Alexander! Alexander!
- I'm terribly sorry.

106
00:07:12,941 --> 00:07:15,933
How do you think I feel?
All right, Angelica!

107
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,343
Alexander, Alexander, come here.
Look at the pretty goat.

108
00:07:19,414 --> 00:07:22,906
Carlo and I found him in the Bronx.
Isn't he just sweet?

109
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,249
- He doesn't smell very sweet.
- Oh, Alexander never did like animals.

110
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,619
Come on, goat, goat, goat.
Come on. Come on.

111
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,181
- Are you talking to me or that thing?
- Oh, Alexander!

112
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:35,059
Don't be afraid of the stairs. Angelica
won't let anything happen to you.

113
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,598
Quick, quick, quick.
Come on. Quick, quick.

114
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,065
Come on, goat, goat, goat.
Come on.

115
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:47,001
I have a goat!
I have a goat!

116
00:07:47,075 --> 00:07:49,703
I have a goat!

117
00:07:49,778 --> 00:07:52,941
Will you please
pay attention to me?

118
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,744
I'm Mrs. Bullock,
and I have a goat.

119
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:58,911
<i>I have a goat!
I have a goat!</i>

120
00:07:58,987 --> 00:08:02,150
I have a goat!
I have a goat!

121
00:08:02,223 --> 00:08:06,284
I know you've got a goat. Will you
please get Mrs. Bullock's goat?

122
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:09,057
Get those things
out of the way.

123
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:15,664
I have a little baby goat.

124
00:08:15,737 --> 00:08:18,900
What am I supposed
to do with that?

125
00:08:18,973 --> 00:08:20,998
- What else do we have to find?
- What?

126
00:08:21,075 --> 00:08:23,566
What else do we have to get?

127
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:27,012
All you have to get is one forgotten man
and a bowl of Japanese goldfish.

128
00:08:27,081 --> 00:08:29,982
What? Get that thing
out of the way! What?

129
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,020
I said, a forgotten man
and a bowl of Japanese goldfish.

130
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:36,579
One man... Let's go.

131
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:38,853
A Japanese man.

132
00:08:38,927 --> 00:08:42,226
A man and a bowl
of Japanese men.

133
00:08:42,297 --> 00:08:45,130
- I can't remember what he said.
- How about going home?

134
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,067
- What are you talking about?
- How about going home?

135
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:50,661
We just have
two other things to get.

136
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,070
A bowl of Japanese men
and a forgotten goldfish.

137
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:56,599
- Goldfish!
- I don't know about the goldfish!

138
00:08:56,678 --> 00:09:00,910
But if you want a forgotten man,
you'll find me home in bed!

139
00:09:00,982 --> 00:09:04,145
I can't concentrate, Alexander.
Come along, Carlo. Goldfish...

140
00:09:06,187 --> 00:09:08,655
- Are all these people hunters?
- Oh, no, we work in groups.

141
00:09:08,723 --> 00:09:10,918
Some are hunters,
and some are receivers.

142
00:09:10,992 --> 00:09:13,756
- Sounds like a bankruptcy proceeding.
- I never thought of that.

143
00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:16,160
- Who receives me?
- I have to take you to the committee.

144
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:18,665
- You don't mind, do you?
- I can hardly wait.

145
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:20,860
Wait a minute!
What have you there?

146
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,666
This is Godfrey.
Is Cornelia back yet?

147
00:09:23,738 --> 00:09:26,172
I haven't seen Cornelia.
Where did you find him?

148
00:09:29,511 --> 00:09:33,072
Oh, Mr. Guthrie!
Come on this way.

149
00:09:33,148 --> 00:09:36,584
Mr. Guthrie!
Mr. Guthrie!

150
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:40,087
I have a forgotten man.

151
00:09:40,155 --> 00:09:43,989
I have a forgotten man!
Mr. Guthrie, this is Godfrey.

152
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:46,357
He's a forgotten man!
Mr. Guthrie!

153
00:09:46,428 --> 00:09:48,555
- A forgotten man!
- His name is Godfrey.

154
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,860
- A forgotten man? You got all eight.
- Yes.

155
00:09:50,932 --> 00:09:53,196
Ladies and gentlemen,
please, quiet, quiet.

156
00:09:53,268 --> 00:09:55,202
Miss Bullock has a forgotten man.

157
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,397
Do you mind stepping up
on the platform, please.

158
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:00,703
Yes, get right up
on the platform, Godfrey.

159
00:10:00,775 --> 00:10:04,643
- Mind if I ask you a few questions?
- Fire away.

160
00:10:04,713 --> 00:10:08,809
- What is your address?
- City Dump 32, East River, Sutton Place.

161
00:10:08,883 --> 00:10:11,977
<i>- It's rather fashionable over there.
- In spots.</i>

162
00:10:12,053 --> 00:10:15,454
- Is that your permanent address?
- The permanency is questionable.

163
00:10:15,523 --> 00:10:18,424
See, the place is being
rapidly filled in.

164
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:22,554
- Mind if I ask a personal question?
- If it isn't too personal.

165
00:10:22,031 --> 00:10:25,125
- Are those whiskers your own?
- No one else has claimed them.

166
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,862
I must ask that question
because one group...

167
00:10:27,936 --> 00:10:31,997
tried to fool the committee by trying to
put false whiskers on one of their own.

168
00:10:32,074 --> 00:10:35,908
- May I, uh... May I, uh...
- What?

169
00:10:35,978 --> 00:10:38,139
Oh, it's a pleasure.

170
00:10:38,213 --> 00:10:40,977
One more question.
Are you wanted by the police?

171
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,644
Ah, that's just the trouble.
Nobody wants me.

172
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:46,347
<i>- Oh, very good answer.
- Splendid, Godfrey.</i>

173
00:10:46,422 --> 00:10:48,788
You mean, nobody wants him?
Nobody at all?

174
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,916
- Nobody.
- Oh, that's too bad.

175
00:10:50,993 --> 00:10:53,928
On the contrary,
I sometimes find it a great advantage.

176
00:10:53,996 --> 00:10:55,930
The committee is satisfied.
Miss Irene Bullock...

177
00:10:55,998 --> 00:10:57,932
wins 20 points
for a forgotten man...

178
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,730
and 50 points extra
for bringing in the first one.

179
00:11:00,803 --> 00:11:03,169
<i>- Oh, bravo!
- Speech! Speech!</i>

180
00:11:03,238 --> 00:11:05,763
Group ten...

181
00:11:05,841 --> 00:11:08,833
<i>- Speech! Speech!
- Group ten wins the silver cup.</i>

182
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:11,277
<i>- Oh, thank you.
- Speech! Speech!</i>

183
00:11:11,346 --> 00:11:13,746
<i>- They want a speech. Come on!
- Speech!</i>

184
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:20,246
My purpose in coming here
tonight was twofold.

185
00:11:20,323 --> 00:11:23,292
Firstly, I wanted
to aid this young lady.

186
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:25,293
Secondly, I was curious to see...

187
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:28,262
how a bunch empty-headed nitwits
conducted themselves.

188
00:11:28,331 --> 00:11:30,731
My curiosity is satisfied.

189
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,462
I assure you it will be
a pleasure for me...

190
00:11:33,536 --> 00:11:36,903
to go back to a society
of really important people.

191
00:11:36,973 --> 00:11:38,998
- What did he call us?
- Nitwits.

192
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:41,908
- Nitwits? What are they?
- I don't know.

193
00:11:41,978 --> 00:11:43,912
<i>The man's perfect!</i>

194
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,847
<i>I've been wanting to say that,
but I didn't have the nerve.</i>

195
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:50,113
<i>Oh, Godfrey!
Oh, Godfrey!</i>

196
00:11:50,186 --> 00:11:52,711
Oh, Godfrey,
I'm terribly sorry.

197
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:55,781
- That's all right.
- I'd never brought you here.

198
00:11:55,858 --> 00:11:59,794
This is the first time I've ever beaten
Cornelia, and you helped me do it.

199
00:11:59,862 --> 00:12:02,387
Well, that makes me
a Cornelia beater, doesn't it?

200
00:12:02,465 --> 00:12:05,400
You've done something for me.
I wish I could do something for you.

201
00:12:05,468 --> 00:12:08,960
- Why?
- Because you've done something for me.

202
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:12,599
No, I don't see. But I could use a job,
if you've got one.

203
00:12:12,675 --> 00:12:14,700
- Can you "buttle"?
- "Buttle"?

204
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:17,245
We're fresh out of butlers.
The one we had left this morning.

205
00:12:17,313 --> 00:12:20,077
<i>Irene, they're calling for you
in the jade room.</i>

206
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:23,084
- Don't you want your cup?
- Tell them to keep their cup.

207
00:12:23,152 --> 00:12:25,814
You can't talk to this man.
What will people think?

208
00:12:25,888 --> 00:12:28,721
I don't care what they think.
Godfrey's gonna be our butler.

209
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,487
- He's gonna be whose butler?
- He's gonna work for us.

210
00:12:31,561 --> 00:12:33,495
Oh, that's ridiculous.
You don't know anything about him.

211
00:12:33,563 --> 00:12:35,497
He hasn't any recommendations...

212
00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:37,499
The last one had recommendations
and stole all the silver.

213
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:39,501
That was merely a coincidence.

214
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:42,402
People that take in stray cats
say they make the best pets.

215
00:12:42,472 --> 00:12:44,906
I don't see what cats
have got to do with butlers.

216
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:47,738
You mustn't pay any attention
to my daughter. She's very impulsive.

217
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,801
- I'm not impulsive!
- Don't shout at your mother.

218
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:52,905
- I will shout!
- Oh, Mrs. Meriwether, Irene is shouting.

219
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:57,078
- You mean it's all over?
- Yes, she always shouts when she wins.

220
00:12:57,153 --> 00:13:01,647
Run along, my good man. Thank you so
much for coming. Thank you so, so much.

221
00:13:01,724 --> 00:13:03,954
<i>He will not run along!</i>

222
00:13:04,026 --> 00:13:07,189
<i>I think I'd better.</i>

223
00:13:07,263 --> 00:13:10,664
My word! There's Cornelia,
and she has another one!

224
00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:17,437
You're a little late, Cornelia.
I've won the game.

225
00:13:17,507 --> 00:13:20,635
- Oh, you have?
- Where do I get my five bucks?

226
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,110
Bucks? What...
Will you talk to your sister?

227
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:25,579
<i>She wants to hire this man
as a butler.</i>

228
00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:28,708
Why not? He might make
a very good butler.

229
00:13:28,784 --> 00:13:31,378
I'm sure I'd make
a very good butler.

230
00:13:31,454 --> 00:13:33,615
Hey, where do I get
my five bucks?

231
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:37,181
Bucks? Bucks? What's he talking
about? What's he talking about?

232
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,195
- Five bucks!
- I promised him five dollars.

233
00:13:40,263 --> 00:13:43,562
Well, give him the five dollars and the
bucks too, and get him out of here...

234
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:45,828
before your sister
hires him as a chauffeur.

235
00:13:45,902 --> 00:13:48,837
Why did I have to find out
there's insanity on your father's side?

236
00:13:48,905 --> 00:13:50,839
Come along, Cornelia.

237
00:13:50,907 --> 00:13:54,343
I hope, Godfrey,
that you're very good at shining shoes.

238
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,504
I think we'd better drop
the whole idea, don't you?

239
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,879
I should say not. You're gonna make
the best butler we ever had.

240
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:04,181
And here. You'll need
some clothes and things, you know.

241
00:14:04,253 --> 00:14:06,847
Oh, well, I...

242
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:14,329
I told G. To lay out my other coat.

243
00:14:14,397 --> 00:14:18,060
You have a wonderful sense of humor.

244
00:14:18,134 --> 00:14:20,068
Thank you.

245
00:14:20,136 --> 00:14:22,900
Well, then... good night.

246
00:14:22,972 --> 00:14:25,839
Oh, uh, just one question.

247
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:27,842
- What?
- Where do you live?

248
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,777
Oh, 1011 Fifth.
Funny, I never thought of that.

249
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:33,337
- No, you didn't.
- No.

250
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,852
1011 Fifth.
Well, good night again.

251
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,353
Good night, Godfrey.

252
00:14:55,805 --> 00:14:58,103
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

253
00:14:58,174 --> 00:15:01,371
- I'm the new, uh...
- Yes, I know. You're the new butler.

254
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:05,039
- How did you know?
- There's one every day at this hour.

255
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:07,480
They're dropping in and out
all the time.

256
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,484
Why is that?

257
00:15:09,552 --> 00:15:12,385
Some get fired,
some quit.

258
00:15:12,455 --> 00:15:15,720
- Is the family that exacting?
- No, they're that nutty.

259
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,326
- May I be frank?
- Is that your name?

260
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:22,956
- No, my name is Godfrey.
- All right, be frank.

261
00:15:23,032 --> 00:15:26,468
You're, uh,
quite an enthusiast.

262
00:15:26,535 --> 00:15:29,629
Don't you worry about me.
I'm a seasoned campaigner.

263
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:32,765
Uh, may we be friends?

264
00:15:32,842 --> 00:15:36,039
Oh, I'm friends
with all the butlers. Sit down.

265
00:15:36,112 --> 00:15:39,741
What's a three-letter sea bird
with an "R" in the middle?

266
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:43,148
That's... Oh, I...
I don't know.

267
00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:46,347
You're no help.
Where'd you get the trick suit?

268
00:15:46,422 --> 00:15:48,356
What's the matter with it?

269
00:15:48,424 --> 00:15:52,360
Well, it might look better
if you took the rental tag off the coat.

270
00:15:52,428 --> 00:15:55,363
Oh... thanks.

271
00:15:55,431 --> 00:15:58,559
Does the butler have quarters here
in the house, or is that necessary?

272
00:15:58,634 --> 00:16:00,864
Oh, you won't need any quarters.
Hang your hat near the door...

273
00:16:00,936 --> 00:16:02,870
so you can get it quickly
on the way out.

274
00:16:02,938 --> 00:16:05,065
What's that?

275
00:16:05,141 --> 00:16:08,235
That's the old battle axe.
She usually rings about this time.

276
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,302
- The old battle axe?
- Mrs. Bullock. She's the mother type.

277
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,543
- Well, don't you do anything about it?
- Mrs. Bullock or the buzzer?

278
00:16:14,617 --> 00:16:16,608
- The buzzer.
- Not the first time.

279
00:16:16,686 --> 00:16:20,747
If she has a hangover, she'll ring again
in a minute in no uncertain terms.

280
00:16:20,823 --> 00:16:24,156
Then, brother, you better
grab her tomato juice and get going.

281
00:16:24,226 --> 00:16:27,252
<i>Ah, there she blows.</i>

282
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,530
Well, Cupid, this is
your big opportunity.

283
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,534
Shall I take it to her?

284
00:16:33,602 --> 00:16:35,763
You might as well
know the worst.

285
00:16:35,838 --> 00:16:37,965
- I want to warn you, she sees pixies.
- Pixies?

286
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,907
- You know, the little men.
- Oh, those.

287
00:16:40,976 --> 00:16:43,911
I know how to take care of those.
Have you any Worcestershire?

288
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:46,004
What are you
gonna do with that?

289
00:16:46,082 --> 00:16:48,312
Do unto others as you would
have others do unto you.

290
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:50,614
What do you want to do?
Scorch her windpipe?

291
00:16:50,686 --> 00:16:53,621
There's nothing like a counterirritant.
Where do I find her?

292
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:55,816
You better go this way.
It's quicker.

293
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:57,825
The upper landing,
to the left.

294
00:17:06,969 --> 00:17:09,870
- Just which is her...
- That's her cage up there, first door.

295
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:12,874
- Oh. Wish me luck.
- Happy landing.

296
00:17:51,514 --> 00:17:53,539
What day is it, Molly?

297
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:56,016
- I'm not Molly.
- Who isn't?

298
00:17:56,085 --> 00:17:58,019
I'm not.

299
00:17:58,087 --> 00:18:01,056
Stop jumping up and down,
so I can see who you are.

300
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,591
- I'm not jumping.
- That's better.

301
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:06,093
- What's your name?
- Godfrey.

302
00:18:06,162 --> 00:18:08,187
Are you someone I know?

303
00:18:08,264 --> 00:18:10,892
We met last night
at the Waldorf Ritz.

304
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:14,402
Oh, yes, you were
with Mrs. Maxton's party at the bar.

305
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,404
Or were you?

306
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:18,736
I'm the forgotten man.

307
00:18:18,808 --> 00:18:21,606
So many people
have such bad memories.

308
00:18:21,677 --> 00:18:23,611
That's so true.

309
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,139
Why do they keep playing
that same tune over and over again?

310
00:18:28,217 --> 00:18:30,151
Why do they?

311
00:18:30,219 --> 00:18:32,915
Don't you hear it?

312
00:18:35,224 --> 00:18:39,752
Oh... yes, yes, I do,
in a way.

313
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:43,856
Always the same tune
over and over again.

314
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:46,094
May I, uh...

315
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:49,331
May you what?
Where are you?

316
00:18:49,405 --> 00:18:51,566
What's that?

317
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,665
Pixie remover.

318
00:18:53,742 --> 00:18:56,267
Oh. Then you see them too.

319
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:58,176
We're old friends.

320
00:18:58,247 --> 00:19:00,306
Yes, but you mustn't
step on them.

321
00:19:00,382 --> 00:19:03,943
I don't like them, but I don't like
to see them stepped on.

322
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:07,318
I'll be very careful.
I wouldn't hurt them for the world.

323
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:09,983
<i>- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Drink it.</i>

324
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:12,721
And they'll go away very quickly.

325
00:19:12,795 --> 00:19:15,127
Very, very quickly.

326
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,829
You must never be rough with them.
You must always send them away quietly.

327
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:29,533
- Is that better?
- Yes. You're a great help.

328
00:19:29,612 --> 00:19:32,376
Go away, little men.
Go away. Shh, shh, shh.

329
00:19:32,448 --> 00:19:36,214
Oh, but... Oh, you haven't
told me who you are.

330
00:19:36,285 --> 00:19:40,221
I'm Godfrey, the forgotten man.
I'm the new butler.

331
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:43,315
- Are you that ugly man with the beard?
- The same.

332
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:46,156
Oh, you've changed.
I should never have known you.

333
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:48,890
- Thank you.
- You're very comforting.

334
00:19:48,964 --> 00:19:51,432
I hope I'll see more of you.

335
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,368
Maybe I'd better not drink any more
of this, or you might go away too.

336
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:11,648
I put your hat
at the foot of the stairs.

337
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,654
You can go out
the front way.

338
00:20:13,722 --> 00:20:16,657
- I think I won the first round.
- You're still working here?

339
00:20:16,725 --> 00:20:19,694
- Haven't heard anything to the contrary.
- You just got by the cub.

340
00:20:19,762 --> 00:20:21,855
- Try the lioness.
- Oh, which is she?

341
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:25,196
Her name's Cornelia.
She's a sweet-tempered little number.

342
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,861
- Yes, I met her last night.
- You've got a treat coming.

343
00:20:27,937 --> 00:20:30,872
You never met her in the morning.
Second door.

344
00:20:47,356 --> 00:20:51,793
<i>Who are you,
and what are you doing in here?</i>

345
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,557
<i>Get out! I don't want
a hobo serving my breakfast!</i>

346
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:59,123
<i>Don't ever come here again,
if you know what's good for you.</i>

347
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:01,567
I'm afraid I lost
the second round.

348
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:04,071
<i>Hey, I want the new butler
to bring me breakfast!</i>

349
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:07,404
Opportunity never stops knocking
in this house. Want to try again?

350
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:11,310
- How is she in the morning?
- Not as violent, but more insidious.

351
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,314
Here goes.

352
00:21:13,382 --> 00:21:17,318
<i>I'll leave your things right up here,
so you won't forget them.</i>

353
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:28,528
Good morning.
I brought your breakfast.

354
00:21:28,597 --> 00:21:30,531
A- Are you the new butler?

355
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:34,365
- Don't you remember last night?
- What happened to Godfrey?

356
00:21:34,436 --> 00:21:36,870
- I'm Godfrey.
- Oh, you look so different.

357
00:21:36,939 --> 00:21:40,033
What happened
to those nice whiskers?

358
00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:42,737
Turn around.
Let me look at you.

359
00:21:42,811 --> 00:21:45,075
You're the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

360
00:21:45,147 --> 00:21:47,115
Thank you.
Will there be anything else?

361
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:50,413
Yes. Sit down and talk to me.
I like to talk in the morning...

362
00:21:50,486 --> 00:21:52,784
especially if you've been
somewhere the night before.

363
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:55,289
Don't you think it'd be better
if I talked standing?

364
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:57,291
No. If you're uncomfortable,
I get uncomfortable,

365
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,486
I get uncomfortable and forget
what I have to say.

366
00:21:59,561 --> 00:22:01,495
If you insist.

367
00:22:01,563 --> 00:22:03,997
But it doesn't seem in very
good form for a butler.

368
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:07,365
Oh, you're more than a butler.
You're the first protege I ever had.

369
00:22:07,436 --> 00:22:09,495
- Protege?
- You know, like Carlo.

370
00:22:09,571 --> 00:22:12,540
- Who is Carlo?
- He's Mother's protege!

371
00:22:12,608 --> 00:22:16,203
You know, it's awfully nice
Carlo having a sponsor,

372
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:19,270
because he doesn't have to work and
he gets more time for his practicing.

373
00:22:19,348 --> 00:22:22,374
- And that makes a difference.
- Yes, I imagine it would.

374
00:22:22,451 --> 00:22:25,818
Do you play anything?
Oh, I don't mean games.

375
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:28,118
- I mean the piano and things like that.
- Well, I...

376
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,317
It doesn't really
make any difference.

377
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:32,326
It's funny how some things
make you think of other things.

378
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:34,328
Yes, very peculiar.

379
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:38,526
- Makes me feel so mature and grown up.
- What does?

380
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,364
Having a protege.
You're the first one I ever had.

381
00:22:41,437 --> 00:22:44,634
- You've never had others?
- You're the first, and it's thrilling.

382
00:22:44,706 --> 00:22:47,937
Not only does it occupy my mind,
but it's character-building too.

383
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:52,106
Mm-hmm. Just what
does a protege have to do?

384
00:22:52,181 --> 00:22:55,378
Well, you just go on buttling,
and I sponsor you. Don't you see?

385
00:22:55,451 --> 00:22:57,851
Yeah, it's getting clearer.

386
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,185
It's really not much work,
and it's gonna be such fun.

387
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:04,191
I'm sure it's going
to be heaps of fun.

388
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:07,524
For instance, if Cornelia got mean, you
wouldn't have to do anything about it.

389
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:10,360
I'm your sponsor,
and I'd just take a sock at her.

390
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:12,366
I hope that'll
never be necessary.

391
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:14,527
I just wanted
to give you the idea.

392
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:18,039
That's fine, but a protege
has certain responsibilities also.

393
00:23:18,107 --> 00:23:21,543
For instance, if someone should ring
for me now and I didn't answer,

394
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,044
that would reflect upon you
because you're my sponsor.

395
00:23:24,113 --> 00:23:27,048
- Don't you see?
- Yes, I never thought of that.

396
00:23:27,116 --> 00:23:30,051
You don't know how nice it is having
some intelligent person to talk to.

397
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:32,246
It's been very enlightening
to me too.

398
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:34,755
Oh, I just thought of something.
Do you know what you are?

399
00:23:34,823 --> 00:23:38,054
- I'm not quite sure.
- You're my responsibility.

400
00:23:38,127 --> 00:23:41,096
- That's very nice.
- See you in church.

401
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:59,303
Good morning.
Fine morning, sir.

402
00:23:59,381 --> 00:24:01,872
Yes, it is a fine morning.

403
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:10,450
Don't be in a hurry.

404
00:24:10,526 --> 00:24:12,926
You see,
I'm the old-fashioned type.

405
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:16,123
And I was also middleweight champion
when I was in college.

406
00:24:16,198 --> 00:24:19,224
I thought you might like to know that
before this thing starts.

407
00:24:19,301 --> 00:24:21,428
Well, you see, sir,
I'm the new butler.

408
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:23,437
I just served Miss Irene
her breakfast.

409
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:26,599
Do you always take a change of wardrobe
when you serve breakfast?

410
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:29,109
Well... I think
this young lady can explain.

411
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:31,442
He really is the new butler,
Mr. Bullock.

412
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:33,913
I can't imagine how his things
got in the hallway.

413
00:24:33,982 --> 00:24:37,349
I still don't get it. But if you are
the new butler, why didn't you say so?

414
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:39,546
I'm very sorry, sir.
May I?

415
00:24:39,621 --> 00:24:42,613
There's a man at the door to see you.
I think it's another process server.

416
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:44,625
- Another one?
- Yes, sir.

417
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:50,290
Well, here I am again
with another little present...

418
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:53,459
Yes, I've heard that before. Which one
of the family is it this time?

419
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:57,699
Miss Cornelia. Last night, she busted
up a few windows along Fifth Avenue.

420
00:24:57,773 --> 00:25:01,539
- I'm sorry, but girls will be girls.
- Good-bye.

421
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:04,545
In this family,
it's one subpoena after another.

422
00:25:04,613 --> 00:25:08,447
Mr. Bullock, there's a handsome
cab driver waiting in the kitchen.

423
00:25:08,517 --> 00:25:11,918
- What's he want?
- He wants $50 and his horse.

424
00:25:11,987 --> 00:25:13,921
What horse?

425
00:25:13,989 --> 00:25:17,117
The one Miss Irene rode
up the front steps last night.

426
00:25:17,192 --> 00:25:19,524
Where is his horse?
I haven't got it.

427
00:25:19,595 --> 00:25:22,689
It's in the library,
where Miss Irene left it.

428
00:25:35,143 --> 00:25:37,771
Well, do you begin
to get the idea?

429
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:09,839
Come here, my man.

430
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:16,217
Do you like your place here,
so far as you've gone?

431
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:18,219
I find it very entertaining.

432
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:20,755
Yes, we are a very
entertaining family.

433
00:26:20,822 --> 00:26:23,052
You really think you're
going to like it here?

434
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:27,221
I must admit it's more desirable than
living in a packing case on a city dump.

435
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:29,856
Oh, that's where I met you,
isn't it?

436
00:26:29,931 --> 00:26:33,594
- Yes, miss.
- Oh, yes, yes. I remember now.

437
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:36,934
We were playing some sort of a game...
a scavenger hunt, I think.

438
00:26:37,005 --> 00:26:41,465
<i>We needed a forgotten man. I asked you
to go to the Waldorf Ritz Hotel with me,</i>

439
00:26:41,543 --> 00:26:45,172
and I'm a little bit hazy as to
just what happened after that.

440
00:26:45,247 --> 00:26:48,512
- I pushed you into an ash pile.
- Oh, yes, of course you did.

441
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:52,314
It was very amusing.
They were nice, clean ashes.

442
00:26:52,387 --> 00:26:55,254
- I'm very sorry, miss.
- I didn't mind at all.

443
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:58,418
It was very amusing.
Have you a handkerchief?

444
00:26:58,493 --> 00:27:02,759
<i>There's a spot on my shoe.
Would you see what you can do about it?</i>

445
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:13,274
I could have you fired, you know?
But I like to see things wriggle.

446
00:27:13,342 --> 00:27:15,469
When I get through with you,

447
00:27:15,544 --> 00:27:18,342
you'll go back to your packing case
on the city dump and relish it.

448
00:27:18,413 --> 00:27:21,871
People don't make a practice of pushing
Cornelia Bullock into ash piles.

449
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,851
<i>I'll make your life so miser...</i>

450
00:27:29,057 --> 00:27:31,082
- Hello, Godfrey.
- Greetings, Irene.

451
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:33,650
- I like your new monkey suit.
- Thank you for picking it up.

452
00:27:33,729 --> 00:27:37,165
- It fits very well for a hand-me-down.
- I'm more or less standard.

453
00:27:37,232 --> 00:27:39,393
How do you like
my new pajamas?

454
00:27:39,468 --> 00:27:42,335
I think they're very nice.
Thank you.

455
00:27:45,907 --> 00:27:48,137
- I heard what you said to Godfrey.
- So what?

456
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:51,611
- So you leave him alone!
- Who's gonna make me leave him alone?

457
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,478
If you don't,
you'll get a good sock from me.

458
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:56,642
- Oh, the physical type.
- What I say goes.

459
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,913
Since when did you start
falling in love with butlers?

460
00:27:58,987 --> 00:28:01,512
I'm not in love with him.
He's my protege.

461
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:04,889
Oh, your protege. That's why
you're picking out his suits for him.

462
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,293
Suppose Father hears about this. How
long do you think Godfrey will last?

463
00:28:08,363 --> 00:28:10,558
Father isn't
going to hear about it.

464
00:28:10,632 --> 00:28:12,896
You seem terribly sure
of everything.

465
00:28:12,968 --> 00:28:14,959
If Father hears about Godfrey,

466
00:28:15,036 --> 00:28:17,266
he's also going to hear about you
and that college boy.

467
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:19,569
I don't know
what you're talking about.

468
00:28:19,641 --> 00:28:23,839
But if Father does hear about it, I'm
likely to do a little socking myself.

469
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:28,713
Little Red Riding Hood didn't have
enough charm to trap a wolf her own age,

470
00:28:28,784 --> 00:28:32,686
so she falls in love with the butler
and lives happily ever after.

471
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:35,416
- If you know what I mean.
- I know, if you know what I mean.

472
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:38,015
- May I come in?
- You're in, aren't you?

473
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:41,256
<i>Very interesting book.
The Greeks of the Middle Ages.</i>

474
00:28:41,329 --> 00:28:44,958
Oh, Irene would like that. You love
the Middle Ages, don't you, dear?

475
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:51,971
Ahh.

476
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,531
Oh, Carlo!
Who's giving the concert tonight?

477
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:57,009
- The great Kalininski.
- Oh, the pianist?

478
00:28:57,078 --> 00:29:00,411
- No, cellist.
- What difference does it make?

479
00:29:00,482 --> 00:29:03,883
Oh, it's so nice to see you two girls
having a pleasant chat.

480
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:06,182
Or is it a pleasant chat?

481
00:29:06,254 --> 00:29:11,317
Well, well, well! Imagine the Bullocks
gathered together in one room.

482
00:29:11,393 --> 00:29:15,159
- Don't forget Carlo.
- I'm not going to forget Carlo.

483
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,755
Don't bother about me.
I feel like one of the family.

484
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:20,324
Don't you go away.

485
00:29:20,402 --> 00:29:24,031
You don't mind if I discuss a few family
matters, do you, Carlo, old boy?

486
00:29:24,105 --> 00:29:26,266
- No, not at all.
- Oh, Alexander,

487
00:29:26,341 --> 00:29:30,334
you're not going to bring up those
sordid business matters, I hope.

488
00:29:30,412 --> 00:29:32,710
I've just been going over
last month's bills,

489
00:29:32,781 --> 00:29:35,477
and you people have confused me
with the Treasury Department.

490
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,643
Don't start that again, Dad.

491
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:40,813
I don't mind giving the government
60% of what I make.

492
00:29:40,889 --> 00:29:43,722
But I can't do it
when my family spends 50%!

493
00:29:43,792 --> 00:29:46,693
Well, why should the government
get more money than your own family?

494
00:29:46,761 --> 00:29:51,255
That's what I want to know.
Why should the government get more?

495
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,995
Well, that's just the way
they have of doing things.

496
00:29:54,069 --> 00:29:56,970
Oh! Money, money, money!

497
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:00,439
The Frankenstein monster
that destroys souls!

498
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:04,343
Please don't say anything more
about it! You're upsetting Carlo!

499
00:30:04,412 --> 00:30:07,176
We've got to come
to an understanding right now!

500
00:30:07,249 --> 00:30:09,615
- Either Carlo is or I am.
- Am what?

501
00:30:09,684 --> 00:30:12,744
Well, one of us has got to,
and that's all there is to it.

502
00:30:12,821 --> 00:30:15,847
You're inebriated. You don't know
what you're talking about.

503
00:30:15,924 --> 00:30:19,792
Who would know what they're talking
about, living with a bunch like this?

504
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:23,353
There's one thing I do know.
What this family needs is discipline.

505
00:30:23,431 --> 00:30:25,626
I've been a pretty patient man.

506
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,294
But when people start riding
horses up the front steps...

507
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:31,828
and parking them in the library,
that's going a bit too far.

508
00:30:31,907 --> 00:30:36,742
- Horses?
- Are you insinuating I rode a horse?

509
00:30:36,811 --> 00:30:39,609
Maybe that wasn't a horse
I saw in the library.

510
00:30:39,681 --> 00:30:43,412
I'm positive I didn't ride a horse.
I didn't have my riding costume on.

511
00:30:43,485 --> 00:30:46,921
- Irene rode the horse up the steps.
- What horse?

512
00:30:46,988 --> 00:30:49,479
Don't play innocent.
I begged you not to do it.

513
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:52,789
I didn't ride a horse!
But if I did ride a horse,

514
00:30:52,861 --> 00:30:57,093
who broke those windows
on Fifth Avenue?

515
00:30:57,165 --> 00:30:59,224
- What windows?
- You know what windows!

516
00:30:59,301 --> 00:31:01,929
And how about that college sap?
Yah, yah, yah!

517
00:31:02,003 --> 00:31:06,030
I don't care who broke the horse,
rode the window or yah, yah, yah'ed.

518
00:31:06,107 --> 00:31:09,838
But this family's got to settle down!

519
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:12,402
Will you stop bellowing!
Look what you're doing to Carlo.

520
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,846
<i>- Hang Carlo!
- Ohhh!</i>

521
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:18,181
<i>You've exhausted my patience!
- Did you make these?</i>

522
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:20,721
- I helped.
- They must be wonderful.

523
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:23,417
- I'd like to help, if you'll let me.
- I'd feel honored.

524
00:31:23,491 --> 00:31:27,086
<i>You might as well face the situation.
I've lost a lot of money.</i>

525
00:31:27,162 --> 00:31:29,096
<i>- You have?
- Yes, I have.</i>

526
00:31:29,164 --> 00:31:31,394
Maybe you left it
in your other suit.

527
00:31:31,466 --> 00:31:34,458
If things keep on, it won't be long
till I don't have another suit.

528
00:31:34,536 --> 00:31:36,902
Which ones are poisoned?

529
00:31:36,972 --> 00:31:38,906
Thank you.

530
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:43,874
While we're on the subject, how about
this business of certain people...

531
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:46,971
picking up anybody they find on the city
dump and dragging them into the house?

532
00:31:47,048 --> 00:31:51,041
<i>- We might all be stabbed and robbed.
- Who's going to stab who?</i>

533
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,610
We don't know a thing
about certain people.

534
00:31:53,688 --> 00:31:56,486
Someone should speak to Irene
about picking up strays.

535
00:31:56,558 --> 00:31:58,389
- What's a stray?
- You shut up!

536
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,792
- Me?
- No. Cornelia.

537
00:32:00,862 --> 00:32:03,626
<i>I will not shut up.
My life is precious to me.</i>

538
00:32:03,698 --> 00:32:06,565
- It won't be in a minute.
- Now, now, children.

539
00:32:06,635 --> 00:32:10,127
Come, Carlo. Come and get
some nice hors d'oeuvre.

540
00:32:12,574 --> 00:32:14,906
I think we should get our help
from employment agencies.

541
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:17,501
I don't know
but I agree with Cornelia.

542
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:19,604
<i>What are you all talking about?</i>

543
00:32:30,392 --> 00:32:33,589
You upset Carlo,
and now you're upsetting Irene.

544
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:36,290
Don't you remember her
breakdown last summer?

545
00:32:36,364 --> 00:32:39,162
I certainly do. That's why I'm not
paying any attention to this.

546
00:32:39,234 --> 00:32:44,171
If Mother can sponsor Carlo,
why can't I sponsor Godfrey?

547
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:46,434
<i>Godfrey knows I'm not being personal,</i>

548
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:49,841
<i>but none of us would like to wake up
some morning stabbed to death.</i>

549
00:32:49,911 --> 00:32:52,937
You mustn't
come between Irene and Godfrey.

550
00:32:53,014 --> 00:32:57,144
<i>He's the first thing she's shown any
affection for since her Pomeranian died.</i>

551
00:32:57,218 --> 00:33:00,119
Now, now, Irene.
You mustn't have a spell.

552
00:33:00,188 --> 00:33:03,248
Carlo, quick, quick,
give me a sofa cushion. Here.

553
00:33:03,324 --> 00:33:06,225
Come, darling, lift up
your head like a good girl.

554
00:33:06,294 --> 00:33:09,661
There now, darling, don't cry.
Now, now, darling.

555
00:33:09,731 --> 00:33:12,723
She's not having a spell.
That's old stuff.

556
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:15,292
Darling.

557
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:18,203
- What is all this nonsense?
- Will you be quiet!

558
00:33:18,273 --> 00:33:21,140
You never did understand them.
Why don't you get a doctor?

559
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:23,939
- I don't want a doctor!
- Do you want an ice bag?

560
00:33:24,012 --> 00:33:27,413
- I want to die!
- You mustn't do that.

561
00:33:27,482 --> 00:33:30,383
She makes me ill.
Let's get out of here.

562
00:33:30,452 --> 00:33:33,853
Carlo, do the gorilla for Irene.
It always amuses her.

563
00:33:33,922 --> 00:33:37,323
- I'm not in the mood.
- Stop eating and get in the mood.

564
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:39,826
- Here.
- All right.

565
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:42,192
I'll do it,
but my heart won't be in it.

566
00:33:42,263 --> 00:33:44,731
Irene, be a good girl
and sit up and look at Carlo.

567
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,768
<i>You know it always amuses you.
Come on, quick.</i>

568
00:33:47,836 --> 00:33:50,566
Go ahead, go ahead!

569
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:53,835
<i>Go on, Carlo. Quickly.
Look, Irene! Look at Carlo!</i>

570
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:57,241
Isn't that lovely?
Oh, isn't that clever, Irene? Look!

571
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:07,283
Carlo, come down.
She can see you better.

572
00:34:07,355 --> 00:34:10,290
She's starting to laugh.
Isn't he clever?

573
00:34:10,358 --> 00:34:12,724
<i>Carlo, come down
where Irene can see you.</i>

574
00:34:12,794 --> 00:34:15,888
<i>She's starting to laugh.</i>

575
00:34:20,335 --> 00:34:24,203
<i>Isn't that funny?
Oh, he's on the door. Look! Look!</i>

576
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:27,332
<i>He frightens me!</i>

577
00:34:27,408 --> 00:34:30,571
No, darling, you mustn't be frightened.
He's just playing.

578
00:34:33,982 --> 00:34:36,507
<i>Darling, look at Carlo.</i>

579
00:34:42,724 --> 00:34:46,387
<i>- Look, darling, look. Isn't he clever?
- No!</i>

580
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:49,624
Why don't you stop imitating
a gorilla and imitate a man?

581
00:34:49,697 --> 00:34:52,097
You wouldn't know an artist
if one came up and bit you!

582
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:54,658
This family
doesn't need any stimulant.

583
00:34:54,736 --> 00:34:57,728
I'll be in my room.
You can repeat this order in 30 minutes.

584
00:34:57,806 --> 00:35:00,775
Someday I'm going gorilla
hunting, and I won't miss.

585
00:35:00,842 --> 00:35:04,107
<i>Has Cornelia gone?</i>

586
00:35:04,179 --> 00:35:06,704
<i>Yes, darling, she's gone.</i>

587
00:35:06,781 --> 00:35:09,841
<i>- Where's Godfrey?
- He's here. Don't go away, Godfrey.</i>

588
00:35:09,918 --> 00:35:11,852
<i>We'll be late
for the concert.</i>

589
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,445
I'll be right with you.
Godfrey's right here.

590
00:35:14,522 --> 00:35:17,753
Godfrey, come over here
so Irene can look at you.

591
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:19,987
- Here's Godfrey, darling.
- Where?

592
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:23,724
Right here. Look. Say hello
to Irene so she'll know who you are.

593
00:35:23,798 --> 00:35:26,767
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Godfrey.

594
00:35:26,835 --> 00:35:29,804
And he's promised to stay on.
Haven't you, Godfrey?

595
00:35:29,871 --> 00:35:32,135
- If I'm wanted.
- Of course you're wanted, isn't he?

596
00:35:32,207 --> 00:35:35,643
- Yes. Go away.
- I'm going. Take good care of her.

597
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,804
Yes, Carlo, I'm coming.
Good-bye, darling, good-bye.

598
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:46,119
I beg your pardon?

599
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:51,117
I'm sorry,
but I didn't quite hear...

600
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:54,389
I said, I'm not really
having a spell.

601
00:36:01,574 --> 00:36:07,274
<i>#Ochi Chornie #</i>

602
00:36:07,346 --> 00:36:12,841
<i>#Ochi Chornie #</i>

603
00:36:12,918 --> 00:36:17,014
<i>#Ochi Chornie #</i>

604
00:36:17,089 --> 00:36:20,616
<i>#Ochi Chornie #</i>

605
00:36:20,693 --> 00:36:23,958
That's a very pretty tune.
What's the name of it?

606
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:27,192
<i>#Ochi Chornie #</i>

607
00:36:27,266 --> 00:36:30,133
<i>Oh, that's the name too.
I thought it was just the words.</i>

608
00:36:30,202 --> 00:36:33,069
I like it because
the words are all the same.

609
00:36:33,139 --> 00:36:36,267
That's probably why "The Star
Spangled Banner" is so confusing.

610
00:36:36,342 --> 00:36:38,640
Nobody seems to know the words.

611
00:36:38,711 --> 00:36:41,771
<i>Except, perhaps, Godfrey.
He seems to know everything.</i>

612
00:36:41,847 --> 00:36:44,816
- Do you know the words?
- The words?

613
00:36:44,884 --> 00:36:48,376
<i>Yes, yes. "The Star Spangled Banner. "
Nobody seems to know the words.</i>

614
00:36:48,454 --> 00:36:50,388
Do you know them, Godfrey?

615
00:36:50,456 --> 00:36:52,890
I suppose I know as many
as the average person.

616
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:55,620
I feel ashamed of myself.
I should know them all.

617
00:36:55,694 --> 00:36:58,128
After all, my ancestors
came over on the boat.

618
00:36:58,197 --> 00:37:00,392
<i>Not the Mayflower,
but the boat after that.</i>

619
00:37:00,466 --> 00:37:03,196
What did your ancestors
come over on, Godfrey?

620
00:37:03,269 --> 00:37:05,737
As far as I know,
they've always been here.

621
00:37:05,805 --> 00:37:07,796
They weren't Indians,
I hope.

622
00:37:07,873 --> 00:37:10,171
One can never be sure
of one's ancestors...

623
00:37:10,242 --> 00:37:13,075
You know, you have
rather high cheekbones.

624
00:37:13,145 --> 00:37:15,443
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.

625
00:37:15,514 --> 00:37:17,744
<i>These flowers came for Irene.
Where shall I put them?</i>

626
00:37:17,817 --> 00:37:20,479
Well, ask her.
There she is now.

627
00:37:20,553 --> 00:37:22,612
Yes, ma'am.

628
00:37:22,688 --> 00:37:25,680
Psst, Carlo.
Did you notice his cheekbones?

629
00:37:25,758 --> 00:37:28,886
These flowers just came for you, miss.
Where shall I put them?

630
00:37:28,961 --> 00:37:33,227
What difference does it make
when one's heart is breaking?

631
00:37:33,299 --> 00:37:35,824
Yes, miss.
Shall I put them on the piano?

632
00:37:35,901 --> 00:37:38,301
Life is but an empty bubble.

633
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:42,773
<i>You don't sound very cheerful
for a girl who's giving a tea party.</i>

634
00:37:42,842 --> 00:37:44,776
Why should anyone
be cheerful?

635
00:37:44,844 --> 00:37:46,835
Oh, is Irene
giving a tea party?

636
00:37:46,912 --> 00:37:49,142
- You're not invited.
- I'll invite myself.

637
00:37:49,215 --> 00:37:51,809
<i>- Let's stick around, George.
- Sure. Why not?</i>

638
00:37:51,884 --> 00:37:55,945
All I have to say is,
some people will be sorry someday.

639
00:37:56,021 --> 00:37:59,149
- Naturally, everybody will be someday.
- For what?

640
00:37:59,225 --> 00:38:02,991
Some people will know for what,
and then it will be too late.

641
00:38:03,062 --> 00:38:05,053
This conversation
is very confusing.

642
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,564
Now, now, Irene.
You mustn't confuse Carlo.

643
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:09,863
<i>He's practicing.</i>

644
00:38:09,935 --> 00:38:12,460
Do you know any good
funeral music, Carlo?

645
00:38:12,538 --> 00:38:14,472
Shut up!

646
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,940
Are you acting
for anybody in particular?

647
00:38:17,009 --> 00:38:21,002
Godfrey might be interested, if
he'd only turn around and look.

648
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,844
Oh, I remember
that pose so well.

649
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:27,579
<i>- I learned in dramatic school. Eight?
- Yeah, that's number eight.</i>

650
00:38:27,653 --> 00:38:30,520
<i>Am I spoiling your act, dear?</i>

651
00:38:30,589 --> 00:38:34,923
I'll spoil something of yours someday,
and it won't be your act.

652
00:38:38,397 --> 00:38:42,299
Do you suppose Miss Irene would
like sandwiches served in here,

653
00:38:42,368 --> 00:38:44,893
or shall I create
a sort of buffet?

654
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:47,336
Where do you want
the sandwiches served?

655
00:38:47,406 --> 00:38:50,307
- What is food?
- Something you eat, silly.

656
00:38:50,376 --> 00:38:53,174
Do you want the sandwiches
served in here, or don't you?

657
00:38:53,245 --> 00:38:56,078
What difference does it make?
Some people do as they like...

658
00:38:56,148 --> 00:38:59,174
with other people's lives,
and it doesn't make any difference.

659
00:39:20,139 --> 00:39:22,403
- What did I call?
- Five, hearts.

660
00:39:22,474 --> 00:39:25,034
Was it hearts?
I meant spades.

661
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:28,045
I can't change, can I?
That music has me so confused.

662
00:39:28,113 --> 00:39:30,809
Carlo, please!

663
00:39:30,883 --> 00:39:33,215
Hi, Irene.
Why the shroud?

664
00:39:33,285 --> 00:39:36,311
Listen, Van Rumple, just because
some people have a million dollars...

665
00:39:36,388 --> 00:39:39,380
doesn't mean they can put
their arms around other people.

666
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:41,426
Brrr!
Where's the bar?

667
00:39:41,493 --> 00:39:45,953
Don't take her seriously. The servant
problem's been bothering her lately.

668
00:39:48,467 --> 00:39:51,197
No, thank you.
I'm not hungry.

669
00:39:56,075 --> 00:39:59,067
No, thank you.

670
00:39:59,144 --> 00:40:03,740
- Four, clubs.
- Oh, just a minute, Godfrey. Uh, bye.

671
00:40:03,816 --> 00:40:05,681
- Hello, everybody!
- Hello, Tommy.

672
00:40:05,751 --> 00:40:08,652
- Oh, Tommy Gray!
- Hello there.

673
00:40:08,721 --> 00:40:11,781
What's the matter with you,
Godfrey? Are you ill?

674
00:40:11,857 --> 00:40:14,257
Come along, Tommy,
and give Angelica a hug.

675
00:40:14,326 --> 00:40:17,124
How's everything in Boston?
All the beans and things?

676
00:40:17,196 --> 00:40:19,687
We're rounding them up
and putting them in cans.

677
00:40:19,765 --> 00:40:22,131
- How are you, darling?
- What does it matter how I am?

678
00:40:22,201 --> 00:40:24,931
<i>- The whole thing is only a delusion.
- What thing?</i>

679
00:40:25,004 --> 00:40:27,268
- You wouldn't understand.
- Well, I don't so far.

680
00:40:27,339 --> 00:40:29,933
I'm famished.
How about something to eat?

681
00:40:30,009 --> 00:40:32,910
Oh, Godfrey,
bring Mr. Gray a sandwich.

682
00:40:32,978 --> 00:40:37,278
It's your play. Well, come around here
Mr. Gray's not an acrobat.

683
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:41,479
What's come over you? You're beginning
to act like the rest of the family.

684
00:40:41,553 --> 00:40:44,852
- Hey, wait a minute!
- What's the trouble?

685
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:49,022
Godfrey Parke, you old mug!

686
00:40:49,094 --> 00:40:52,325
- Oh, do you know Godfrey?
- We went to Harvard together.

687
00:40:52,398 --> 00:40:56,334
<i>I'm afraid you've confused me with
someone else. I'm Smith, remember?</i>

688
00:40:56,402 --> 00:40:59,633
Sure, you're Smith.
We did go to college together?

689
00:40:59,705 --> 00:41:03,300
<i>- Or did we?
- A butler with a college education.</i>

690
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:05,900
<i>- He's not really the butler?
- And a very good one.</i>

691
00:41:05,978 --> 00:41:08,811
You mean, this is not a gag
just for my benefit?

692
00:41:08,881 --> 00:41:12,373
Mr. Gray neglected to tell you that when
we were in Harvard, I was his valet.

693
00:41:12,451 --> 00:41:15,978
- Was he a good servant, Tommy?
- Excellent.

694
00:41:16,055 --> 00:41:18,649
- What's the idea?
- I'll tell you later.

695
00:41:18,724 --> 00:41:21,284
- Mr. Gray never complained.
- When?

696
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,828
No, I had very few complaints
about Godfrey's work.

697
00:41:23,896 --> 00:41:25,887
I'll tell you tomorrow.
It's my day off.

698
00:41:25,964 --> 00:41:28,728
Strange, you never gave
Mr. Gray as a reference.

699
00:41:28,801 --> 00:41:32,259
You see, I left Mr. Gray under
very unusual circumstances.

700
00:41:32,337 --> 00:41:35,864
- What circumstances?
- I'd rather Mr. Gray told you.

701
00:41:35,941 --> 00:41:39,206
<i>Well, don't go away.
Come here and tell us all about it.</i>

702
00:41:39,278 --> 00:41:43,044
Godfrey's a very mysterious person.
Nobody seems to know about him.

703
00:41:43,115 --> 00:41:46,243
<i>- Don't go away, Godfrey.
- No, no, don't go away, Godfrey.</i>

704
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:49,048
You see, I didn't want to say
anything about this.

705
00:41:49,121 --> 00:41:52,887
But, you see, Godfrey had been working
for us as a butler and whatnot,

706
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:55,688
and things had been
going along very well...

707
00:41:55,761 --> 00:41:57,922
<i>when all of a sudden it happened...</i>

708
00:41:57,996 --> 00:41:59,930
just like that.

709
00:41:59,998 --> 00:42:03,695
You're sure you want me
to tell all this, Godfrey?

710
00:42:05,704 --> 00:42:07,638
Well, you see, as I said,

711
00:42:07,706 --> 00:42:10,971
<i>he'd been working for us for some time,
when one day he came to me and said,</i>

712
00:42:11,043 --> 00:42:14,604
<i>"Mr. Gray, I trust my work
has always been satisfactory. "</i>

713
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:20,141
I said, "Why, of course. I've never had
more satisfactory work in all my life. "

714
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:23,450
And he said,
"Thank you, Mr. Gray. "

715
00:42:23,522 --> 00:42:26,719
He was always
a very courteous man, Godfrey.

716
00:42:26,792 --> 00:42:29,989
<i>Godfrey is still extremely courteous,
especially in the morning.</i>

717
00:42:30,062 --> 00:42:32,758
Well, it's not much of a story.
Maybe we'd better skip it.

718
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:35,561
Come on, Tommy, finish it.
You can't stop in the middle.

719
00:42:35,634 --> 00:42:38,228
- Where was I?
- Telling us how polite Godfrey was.

720
00:42:38,303 --> 00:42:41,329
And that's where I said that
Godfrey was still very polite.

721
00:42:41,406 --> 00:42:44,466
Thank you, Mrs. Bullock. It's
a pleasure to have you say so publicly.

722
00:42:44,543 --> 00:42:48,912
That's my nature. I never say anything
behind your back I won't say in public.

723
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:51,245
That's what I admire
about you, Angelica.

724
00:42:51,316 --> 00:42:54,114
That's nice of you, Tommy.
What about the story?

725
00:42:54,186 --> 00:42:57,917
Well, anyway, Godfrey said, "I trust
my work has been satisfactory, sir. "

726
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:00,458
That was about the gist of it,
wasn't it, Godfrey?

727
00:43:00,526 --> 00:43:05,327
Those may not have been my exact words,
sir, but that was about the gist of it.

728
00:43:05,397 --> 00:43:08,366
We'll settle for that.
You said he was very satisfactory.

729
00:43:08,433 --> 00:43:10,924
He said thank you,
and then what?

730
00:43:11,003 --> 00:43:14,530
- I had to take an attitude.
- What kind of an attitude?

731
00:43:14,606 --> 00:43:17,370
<i>Well, the only kind I could take
toward a faithful servant.</i>

732
00:43:17,442 --> 00:43:19,842
But Godfrey decided in favor
of his wife and five children.

733
00:43:19,912 --> 00:43:22,938
<i>- Five children? My, my!
- Five.</i>

734
00:43:23,015 --> 00:43:25,711
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Was his wife
an Indian woman?

735
00:43:25,784 --> 00:43:29,049
She was rather dark. We used to take
her on hunting trips to stalk the game.

736
00:43:29,121 --> 00:43:32,716
Godfrey! Why didn't you tell me
you had five children?

737
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:35,225
Why shouldn't Godfrey
have five children?

738
00:43:35,294 --> 00:43:39,890
If a woman in Canada can have five
children, why can't Godfrey? You see?

739
00:43:39,965 --> 00:43:43,162
I owe the creation of my family
to Mr. Gray's generosity.

740
00:43:43,235 --> 00:43:47,331
Well, if other people can have
five children, so can other people.

741
00:43:47,406 --> 00:43:50,739
Personally, I think two are plenty,
and Bullock agrees with me.

742
00:43:52,811 --> 00:43:55,803
Listen, everybody, I want
to make an announcement about something.

743
00:43:55,881 --> 00:43:57,815
What do you want
to announce?

744
00:43:57,883 --> 00:44:01,410
- I'm going to be married.
- Married? To whom?

745
00:44:01,486 --> 00:44:04,512
- Well, you'll find out soon enough.
- Not Charlie Van Rumple?

746
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:08,151
- Yes, Charlie Van Rumple. Where is he?
- He's at the bar.

747
00:44:08,227 --> 00:44:10,161
I've had my arm around her before,

748
00:44:10,229 --> 00:44:12,493
but this is the first time
I ever felt that chill.

749
00:44:12,564 --> 00:44:15,931
- Congratulations, old boy.
- Congratulations about what?

750
00:44:16,001 --> 00:44:18,595
- Your engagement, you slug.
- What engagement?

751
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:21,036
Why, you're engaged
to Irene, aren't you?

752
00:44:21,106 --> 00:44:23,438
- Am I?
- Don't be ga-ga! Come on!

753
00:44:26,812 --> 00:44:29,406
- I hear we're engaged.
- You said it.

754
00:44:29,481 --> 00:44:32,075
- When did it happen?
- Just now.

755
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:36,177
- What's all the excitement?
- I think she's got herself engaged.

756
00:44:36,255 --> 00:44:39,622
Oh, has she again? It must
be that nice boy in the brown suit.

757
00:44:39,691 --> 00:44:41,784
Let's go and congratulate them.

758
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,885
You're a lucky boy.

759
00:44:43,962 --> 00:44:46,328
I know I am.
I'm not Van Rumple.

760
00:44:46,398 --> 00:44:48,696
- Oh, you're not? Which one is he?
- There he is.

761
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,701
You'll pardon me, I hope.

762
00:44:50,769 --> 00:44:53,260
- You're Van Rumple, aren't you?
- Oh, yes.

763
00:44:53,338 --> 00:44:56,466
- Oh, you'll take good care of her.
- I imagine so.

764
00:44:56,541 --> 00:44:59,567
My mind's a little cloudy.
I don't even remember proposing.

765
00:44:59,645 --> 00:45:02,113
You're always proposing.

766
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:05,946
- Which one did you take me up on?
- All of them.

767
00:45:06,018 --> 00:45:09,317
How do you think Godfrey'll
feel about your engagement?

768
00:45:09,388 --> 00:45:12,186
- What has Godfrey got to do with it?
- I wonder.

769
00:45:12,257 --> 00:45:15,192
- You mind your own business.
- All right, let's have those.

770
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:18,593
- Come on, everybody.
- Are you going to congratulate Irene?

771
00:45:18,664 --> 00:45:21,895
- She just got herself engaged.
- I'd be very happy to.

772
00:45:21,967 --> 00:45:24,231
<i>Godfrey, come congratulate Irene.</i>

773
00:45:24,303 --> 00:45:26,498
May I congratulate you, Miss Irene?

774
00:45:26,571 --> 00:45:29,597
I wish you all
the happiness in the world.

775
00:45:33,145 --> 00:45:36,239
<i>Just leave her alone.
She'll be all right in a minute.</i>

776
00:45:36,315 --> 00:45:38,715
- Is she mad at me?
- She's not mad at anybody.

777
00:45:38,784 --> 00:45:42,151
Women always cry at their own
engagements and other people's weddings.

778
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:45,678
- Why?
- I don't know why, but they just do.

779
00:45:45,757 --> 00:45:49,284
Irene is so peculiar. She shouts when
she weeps and cries when she's happy.

780
00:45:49,361 --> 00:45:52,387
- Alexander, you missed the excitement.
- What's going on?

781
00:45:52,464 --> 00:45:55,262
I knew what I wanted to say,
but somehow it slipped my mind.

782
00:45:55,334 --> 00:45:57,598
- What's the matter with Irene?
- Oh, yes, that's it!

783
00:45:57,669 --> 00:45:59,603
- Irene's got engaged.
- To whom?

784
00:45:59,671 --> 00:46:02,834
Van something or other. I think he's
that boy with his arm around that girl.

785
00:46:02,908 --> 00:46:04,876
- He's got lots of money.
- He'll need it.

786
00:46:04,943 --> 00:46:07,207
Godfrey, let's you and I
have a good cry.

787
00:46:07,279 --> 00:46:09,474
How about lunch
by my hotel tomorrow?

788
00:46:09,548 --> 00:46:12,346
Yes, sir. Do you prefer
soda or ginger ale?

789
00:46:12,417 --> 00:46:15,113
- Both. 12:00?
- Very good, sir.

790
00:46:17,789 --> 00:46:21,725
Make up your mind just who she's going
to marry. I'd like to meet the guy.

791
00:46:21,793 --> 00:46:25,092
<i>I don't know, Alexander.
It's one of those boys in there.</i>

792
00:46:25,163 --> 00:46:27,097
<i>Come along, now.</i>

793
00:46:38,377 --> 00:46:40,743
You're not eating well
this morning, sir.

794
00:46:40,812 --> 00:46:43,872
- You notice everything.
- Business trouble, sir?

795
00:46:43,949 --> 00:46:46,679
What made you ask that?

796
00:46:46,752 --> 00:46:51,587
Well, sir, butlers can't help picking
up scraps of news, shall we say?

797
00:46:51,656 --> 00:46:53,851
We shan't say
anything about it.

798
00:46:53,925 --> 00:46:56,018
I thought I might be
of some help, sir.

799
00:46:56,094 --> 00:46:58,221
I dabbled in the market
at one time.

800
00:46:58,296 --> 00:47:00,821
One dabbler in the family
is quite enough.

801
00:47:00,899 --> 00:47:03,993
- Very good, sir. Your eggs.
- No, thank you.

802
00:47:04,069 --> 00:47:07,903
Godfrey, you seem to be
a pretty good sort.

803
00:47:07,973 --> 00:47:11,534
Have you noticed anything queer
about me lately?

804
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:13,771
Nothing particularly, sir.

805
00:47:13,845 --> 00:47:18,509
I sometimes wonder whether my whole
family's gone mad or whether it's me.

806
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:22,280
I know how you feel. I've felt that
way many times since I've been here.

807
00:47:22,354 --> 00:47:25,983
Then why do you stay here?
I have to; you don't.

808
00:47:26,057 --> 00:47:29,788
It's much more comfortable than living
in a packing box on the city dump, sir.

809
00:47:29,861 --> 00:47:32,125
Besides, I'm rather proud
of my job here.

810
00:47:32,197 --> 00:47:35,598
<i>- You're proud of being a butler?
- Proud of being a good butler.</i>

811
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:39,364
And I may add, sir, a butler
has to be good to hold his job here.

812
00:47:44,676 --> 00:47:48,237
Say... who are you?

813
00:47:49,848 --> 00:47:53,306
I'm just a nobody, sir.
Coffee?

814
00:47:55,454 --> 00:47:59,390
Godfrey, here I am.
So you've turned up at last, eh?

815
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:02,393
I began to think
you had fallen down the kitchen sink.

816
00:48:02,461 --> 00:48:05,828
Sorry I'm late, Tommy.
It's hard to make beds full of people.

817
00:48:05,897 --> 00:48:09,128
Waiter! You seem to do everything
except put out the cat.

818
00:48:09,201 --> 00:48:11,795
I suppose I'd do that too,
only we have no cat.

819
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:15,237
The same for me.
What will you have, Jarvis, my man?

820
00:48:15,307 --> 00:48:17,434
Make it a rousing
old lemonade.

821
00:48:17,509 --> 00:48:19,477
Lemonade? You sure
you can handle it?

822
00:48:19,544 --> 00:48:22,479
Oh, yes, I'm the type who
can take it or leave it alone.

823
00:48:22,547 --> 00:48:25,948
You see, now that I'm a working man,
I have to keep my wits about me.

824
00:48:26,017 --> 00:48:29,248
I'm beginning to wonder if you've got
any left. Don't avoid the issue.

825
00:48:29,321 --> 00:48:31,846
I've been sitting here
like a snoopy old maid...

826
00:48:31,923 --> 00:48:35,086
with her ears flapping in the breeze,
waiting to hear the dirt.

827
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,094
What dirt
would you like to hear?

828
00:48:37,162 --> 00:48:41,258
Well, when I see one of the Parkes
of Boston serving hors d'oeuvre...

829
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:44,393
I think I'm entitled
to a pardonable curiosity.

830
00:48:44,469 --> 00:48:47,267
Why tell you something
that you won't understand?

831
00:48:47,339 --> 00:48:50,797
You've fallen off so many polo ponies
that your brain is scrambled.

832
00:48:50,876 --> 00:48:53,367
But I still want to know
why you're buttling,

833
00:48:53,445 --> 00:48:56,937
when your family is telling everybody
that you're in South America.

834
00:48:57,015 --> 00:48:59,609
A family has to say something
to save its face.

835
00:48:59,684 --> 00:49:01,845
The Parkes disgrace
very easily.

836
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,287
I'd like to see their faces when they
find out that you're a butler.

837
00:49:05,357 --> 00:49:09,691
- They're not going to find it out.
- Come to the point.

838
00:49:09,761 --> 00:49:12,457
Well, there isn't
much of a point.

839
00:49:12,531 --> 00:49:15,159
Do you remember that little
incident up in Boston?

840
00:49:15,233 --> 00:49:18,066
You still have that woman
on your mind?

841
00:49:18,136 --> 00:49:22,072
No, not anymore.
But I was pretty bitter at the time.

842
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:25,735
So I gave her everything I had
and just disappeared.

843
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:29,712
You know, the Parkes were
never educated to face life.

844
00:49:29,781 --> 00:49:32,545
<i>- We've been puppets for ten generations.
- And?</i>

845
00:49:32,617 --> 00:49:35,984
Tommy, it's surprising
how fast you can go downhill...

846
00:49:36,054 --> 00:49:38,614
when you begin
to feel sorry for yourself.

847
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:41,386
And boy did I feel sorry
for myself!

848
00:49:41,459 --> 00:49:43,757
I wandered down
to the East River one night,

849
00:49:43,828 --> 00:49:47,093
thinking I'd just slide in
and get it over with.

850
00:49:47,165 --> 00:49:49,599
But I met some fellows
living there, on a city dump.

851
00:49:49,668 --> 00:49:53,627
They were people who were fighting
it out and not complaining.

852
00:49:53,705 --> 00:49:56,230
I never got
as far as the river.

853
00:49:56,308 --> 00:49:58,833
Would you do me
a big favor?

854
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:01,105
- Who do you want killed?
- I'll do my own killing.

855
00:50:01,179 --> 00:50:04,171
Go around the corner and telephone
this place and ask for Tommy Gray.

856
00:50:04,249 --> 00:50:06,547
When you get him on the wire,
keep him there.

857
00:50:06,618 --> 00:50:09,246
- What's this all about?
- Don't ask too many questions.

858
00:50:09,321 --> 00:50:11,255
Okay.

859
00:50:11,323 --> 00:50:13,985
And so out of the ruins
of Godfrey Parke...

860
00:50:14,059 --> 00:50:17,187
a new edifice has sprung up
in the form of Godfrey Smith.

861
00:50:17,262 --> 00:50:20,163
And, I may add, the edifice
is going to keep on springing.

862
00:50:20,231 --> 00:50:22,495
Do you intend
to remain a butler?

863
00:50:22,567 --> 00:50:24,831
No, I have
some other ideas in mind.

864
00:50:24,903 --> 00:50:28,134
But you wouldn't understand
those either, so we won't go into that.

865
00:50:28,206 --> 00:50:30,606
- Will you do me a favor?
- Maybe.

866
00:50:30,675 --> 00:50:33,542
I have a friend in town,
a very eminent brain specialist.

867
00:50:33,612 --> 00:50:35,546
I'd like him
to examine you.

868
00:50:35,614 --> 00:50:38,583
I'll submit to an examination,
if you will also.

869
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:41,118
That's a bet.

870
00:50:41,186 --> 00:50:43,120
- Are you Mr. Gray?
- Yes.

871
00:50:43,188 --> 00:50:45,452
- You're wanted on the phone.
- On the phone? What the...

872
00:50:45,523 --> 00:50:47,923
Back in a minute, Godfrey.

873
00:50:56,101 --> 00:50:59,093
- Well, the mystery's solved.
- The mystery?

874
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:02,606
Yes. Now I know what
a butler does on his day off.

875
00:51:02,674 --> 00:51:05,837
When you worked for Mr. Gray,
were the two of you always this chummy?

876
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:09,311
You see, I worked for Mr. Gray
a long time, and we got to be...

877
00:51:09,381 --> 00:51:12,043
Yeah, that was under
the name of Smith, wasn't it?

878
00:51:12,117 --> 00:51:14,608
Or did I hear him mention
the name of Parke?

879
00:51:14,686 --> 00:51:18,679
He may have said that we used to take
long walks in the park.

880
00:51:18,757 --> 00:51:20,691
- A sort of custom.
- Oh, yes, I see.

881
00:51:20,759 --> 00:51:22,693
Well, if you can be so chummy
with the Grays,

882
00:51:22,761 --> 00:51:24,752
why can't you be chummy
with the Bullocks?

883
00:51:24,829 --> 00:51:28,356
- I try to keep my place.
- Why? You're very attractive.

884
00:51:28,433 --> 00:51:30,867
- As a butler?
- No, as a Smith.

885
00:51:30,935 --> 00:51:34,268
- You're a rotten butler.
- Sorry.

886
00:51:34,339 --> 00:51:36,830
Are we going to be friends?

887
00:51:36,908 --> 00:51:40,503
I feel that on my day off, I should have
the privilege of choosing my friends.

888
00:51:40,578 --> 00:51:42,603
You can't go on like this forever.

889
00:51:42,681 --> 00:51:45,548
You really like me, and you're
afraid to admit it, aren't you?

890
00:51:45,617 --> 00:51:48,279
Do you want me to tell you
what I really think of you?

891
00:51:48,353 --> 00:51:50,844
- Please do.
- As Smith or as a butler?

892
00:51:50,922 --> 00:51:53,948
- Choose your own weapon.
- You won't hold it against me?

893
00:51:54,025 --> 00:51:56,516
- It's your day off.
- Very well.

894
00:51:56,594 --> 00:51:59,188
You belong to that
unfortunate category...

895
00:51:59,264 --> 00:52:01,789
that I would call
the Park Avenue brat.

896
00:52:01,866 --> 00:52:05,029
A spoiled child who's
grown up in ease and luxury,

897
00:52:05,103 --> 00:52:07,401
who's always
had her own way,

898
00:52:07,472 --> 00:52:10,339
and whose misdirected
energies are so childish...

899
00:52:10,408 --> 00:52:14,469
that they hardly deserve the comment
even of a butler on his offThursday.

900
00:52:14,546 --> 00:52:16,480
Thank you for a very lovely portrait.

901
00:52:16,548 --> 00:52:18,812
Hiya, Cornelia.
What are you doing here?

902
00:52:18,883 --> 00:52:21,147
Godfrey and I were discussing
tomorrow's menu.

903
00:52:21,219 --> 00:52:24,017
- Well, don't run away.
- I'm in an awfully big hurry. Good-bye.

904
00:52:24,089 --> 00:52:26,489
I'll see you
down by the ash pile.

905
00:52:26,558 --> 00:52:29,391
- What did she mean by that?
- A little joke we have between us.

906
00:52:29,461 --> 00:52:31,486
Oh, I see.
Ajoking butler.

907
00:52:31,563 --> 00:52:33,656
What's the matter
with that stuff?

908
00:52:33,732 --> 00:52:36,200
I think I'll switch.
I'm more at mood.

909
00:52:36,267 --> 00:52:38,701
Now we're getting
someplace. Waiter!

910
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:40,897
Another one of these.

911
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:54,310
- He's not back yet, is he?
- Not yet.

912
00:52:54,385 --> 00:52:57,081
Would you mind putting these
flowers in his room?

913
00:52:57,155 --> 00:52:59,783
- I can't go in there anymore.
- I can't, either.

914
00:52:59,858 --> 00:53:02,793
- You won't tell him they're from me?
- If you don't want me to.

915
00:53:02,861 --> 00:53:05,352
Oh, I don't want him
to know.

916
00:53:09,868 --> 00:53:11,802
It's his, isn't it?

917
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:14,100
- Do you always sew his buttons on?
- Sometimes.

918
00:53:14,172 --> 00:53:17,300
I'd like to sew his buttons on
sometime when they come off.

919
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:19,843
- I wouldn't mind at all.
- He doesn't lose very many.

920
00:53:19,911 --> 00:53:22,880
- Oh, he's very tidy...
- Yes, he's very tidy.

921
00:53:22,947 --> 00:53:26,383
- What does he do on his day off?
- He never tells me.

922
00:53:26,451 --> 00:53:29,887
He's probably sitting somewhere
with some woman on his lap.

923
00:53:29,954 --> 00:53:32,149
He's the meanest man I know.

924
00:53:32,223 --> 00:53:34,157
I think he's very mean.

925
00:53:34,225 --> 00:53:36,386
I suppose he's sitting
somewhere with somebody on his lap...

926
00:53:36,461 --> 00:53:39,089
who doesn't care for him at all.

927
00:53:39,164 --> 00:53:44,101
As far as I know, maybe his children
are there too, calling him, calling him.

928
00:53:44,169 --> 00:53:46,330
Oh, I can't bear it.

929
00:53:46,404 --> 00:53:48,497
Please don't.

930
00:53:52,777 --> 00:53:55,007
You too?

931
00:53:55,079 --> 00:53:57,604
Oh, Molly, I know
exactly how you feel.

932
00:54:06,825 --> 00:54:08,759
Good evening.

933
00:54:08,827 --> 00:54:11,591
How about a quartet?

934
00:54:13,798 --> 00:54:16,096
Ehh!

935
00:54:16,167 --> 00:54:19,193
# For tomorrow may bring sorrow #

936
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:22,239
# So tonight let us be gay #

937
00:54:24,609 --> 00:54:27,339
"'Courage,' she said,
and pointed toward the land.

938
00:54:27,412 --> 00:54:29,903
"'This wave will roll ashore
but soon. '

939
00:54:29,981 --> 00:54:32,142
"And the afternoon
came into a land...

940
00:54:32,217 --> 00:54:34,412
into which it seemed
always afternoon. "

941
00:54:34,485 --> 00:54:38,319
"All around the coast
the languid air did swoon. "

942
00:54:38,389 --> 00:54:40,550
- What's the matter, darling?
- Nothing.

943
00:54:40,625 --> 00:54:43,560
- She's been eating onions.
- Onions make me sleepy.

944
00:54:43,628 --> 00:54:46,392
Irene loves onions.
When she was a little girl,

945
00:54:46,464 --> 00:54:49,058
she was always stealing
onions from the icebox.

946
00:54:49,133 --> 00:54:52,159
You know, sometimes
I wonder if my children are all there.

947
00:54:52,237 --> 00:54:55,172
"Like a downward smoke,
the slender stream along the cliff...

948
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,266
did fall and fall
and fall to the sea. "

949
00:55:32,577 --> 00:55:34,511
Evening.

950
00:55:49,427 --> 00:55:53,488
I thought I told you to send that
gray satin evening dress to the cleaner.

951
00:55:53,564 --> 00:55:56,556
- Gray satin?
- Why can't you do as you're told?

952
00:55:56,634 --> 00:55:58,568
With pleasure.

953
00:56:04,375 --> 00:56:07,902
Seems to me that every time you pick up
a paper, somebody's been murdered.

954
00:56:07,979 --> 00:56:10,470
Imagine a man drowning
his wife in a bathtub.

955
00:56:10,548 --> 00:56:13,073
Maybe it's the only way
he could get her to take a bath.

956
00:56:13,151 --> 00:56:16,416
Well, if anyone ever drowned
my Duke in their bathtub,

957
00:56:16,487 --> 00:56:19,354
<i>his mama would be
very sad, she would.</i>

958
00:56:19,424 --> 00:56:21,688
Will there be
anything else, madam?

959
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:25,126
I haven't asked for anything, so I don't
see how I could want anything.

960
00:56:25,196 --> 00:56:28,290
I beg your pardon.
I thought you were Miss Cornelia.

961
00:56:28,366 --> 00:56:30,493
You thought
I was Cornelia?

962
00:56:30,568 --> 00:56:35,403
Forgive me, but you seem to be looking
younger every day, if I may say so.

963
00:56:35,473 --> 00:56:39,569
You certainly may. Thank you very much.

964
00:57:26,086 --> 00:57:29,021
Did you send Godfrey
upstairs for anything?

965
00:57:29,089 --> 00:57:32,024
Did I? No, I'm quite sure I didn't.
Why?

966
00:57:32,092 --> 00:57:34,083
I just wondered.

967
00:57:44,238 --> 00:57:46,968
I was in the Kerry Bar today.
That place is getting run down.

968
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:49,566
They're catering
to a very low class of people.

969
00:57:49,643 --> 00:57:51,668
You shouldn't
go in there, my dear.

970
00:57:51,746 --> 00:57:53,941
Darling, what's the matter?
You're not eating anything.

971
00:57:54,014 --> 00:57:56,278
Nobody cares
if I starve myself to death.

972
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:58,375
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

973
00:57:58,452 --> 00:58:00,716
I don't mind dying,
if other people don't.

974
00:58:00,788 --> 00:58:03,188
She's in love.
Haven't you heard?

975
00:58:03,257 --> 00:58:07,694
It's probably her engagement. Several
of my girlfriends acted just like that.

976
00:58:07,762 --> 00:58:11,061
- Maybe her stomach is upset.
- Nobody asked you!

977
00:58:18,272 --> 00:58:20,502
There goes the profits.

978
00:58:20,574 --> 00:58:22,565
I beg your pardon.

979
00:58:22,643 --> 00:58:26,306
I don't know what's the matter with
Godfrey. He's been acting so peculiar.

980
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:28,473
But he did pay me
a nice compliment.

981
00:58:28,549 --> 00:58:30,744
He's always paying
other people compliments.

982
00:58:30,818 --> 00:58:34,754
Why don't you eat? Look at Carlo.
He's had two helpings of everything.

983
00:58:34,822 --> 00:58:37,518
Leave her alone. Carlo's eating
enough for both of them.

984
00:58:37,591 --> 00:58:41,152
He ought to be strong enough
soon to give that concert.

985
00:58:41,228 --> 00:58:43,093
You can't rush genius.

986
00:58:43,164 --> 00:58:46,964
He could give a bang-up concert
right now with a knife and fork.

987
00:58:47,034 --> 00:58:51,494
Why do you always pick on Carlo?
Why not try someone else for a change?

988
00:58:53,808 --> 00:58:57,005
Wait a minute, Mother. Come here, Dad.
Something terrible has happened.

989
00:58:57,077 --> 00:58:59,011
What is it?
What's happened?

990
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:01,946
You look frightened.
You're as white as a sheet.

991
00:59:02,016 --> 00:59:05,577
Let's go into the living room,
where we won't be overheard.

992
00:59:05,653 --> 00:59:08,918
Cornelia, what is it?
Are you ill?

993
00:59:08,989 --> 00:59:11,924
Come, come, sit down here.
Let me get you an aspirin or something.

994
00:59:11,992 --> 00:59:14,586
- I'm all right.
- What's troubling you?

995
00:59:14,662 --> 00:59:17,324
Do you remember the pearl necklace
I got for my birthday?

996
00:59:17,398 --> 00:59:19,332
- Why, yes!
- What about it?

997
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,527
- It's disappeared.
- Maybe somebody stole it.

998
00:59:21,602 --> 00:59:24,070
Will you fill your gob
and keep out of this!

999
00:59:24,138 --> 00:59:26,936
- I was only trying to help.
- We don't need your help.

1000
00:59:27,007 --> 00:59:29,805
- When did you find out?
- I put it on my dressing table.

1001
00:59:29,877 --> 00:59:32,243
I went upstairs just now,
and it was gone.

1002
00:59:32,313 --> 00:59:35,146
- And it cost such a lot of money.
- I'll say it did.

1003
00:59:35,216 --> 00:59:37,707
- What are we going to do?
- I'll go call the police.

1004
00:59:37,785 --> 00:59:40,151
Never mind, Dad.
I've already called them.

1005
00:59:40,221 --> 00:59:42,155
Oh!

1006
00:59:42,223 --> 00:59:46,159
Mm-mm. Well, what I want to know is,
when did you miss the pearls?

1007
00:59:46,227 --> 00:59:49,128
During dinner I went to my room,
and they were gone.

1008
00:59:49,196 --> 00:59:52,495
- She's always leaving them.
- Nobody asked you anything.

1009
00:59:52,566 --> 00:59:56,297
If you're going to be rude to my
daughter, you might take your hats off.

1010
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:59,339
When we're on criminal cases,
lady, we keep both hands free.

1011
00:59:59,406 --> 01:00:01,567
You mean to imply
that I'm a criminal?

1012
01:00:01,642 --> 01:00:04,304
All I know is
that it's an inside job.

1013
01:00:06,213 --> 01:00:08,681
- Who's that?
- It's Mother's protege.

1014
01:00:08,749 --> 01:00:11,479
No wise cracks.
Is that your son?

1015
01:00:11,552 --> 01:00:14,282
That? Say, listen, I've made
a lot of mistakes in my life,

1016
01:00:14,355 --> 01:00:16,755
but I'll be hanged
if I'll plead guilty to that.

1017
01:00:16,824 --> 01:00:18,883
<i>Stop picking on Carlo!</i>

1018
01:00:18,959 --> 01:00:22,395
He wouldn't have time to steal anything.
He's too busy eating.

1019
01:00:22,463 --> 01:00:24,590
- Who are you?
- Guess.

1020
01:00:24,665 --> 01:00:27,691
- Where is Godfrey?
- He isn't feeling very well.

1021
01:00:27,768 --> 01:00:31,226
- Who are you staring at?
- Just a minute, sister.

1022
01:00:31,305 --> 01:00:34,536
If I thought that were true,
I'd disown my parents.

1023
01:00:34,608 --> 01:00:37,736
So you got a passion for jewelry, huh?

1024
01:00:37,811 --> 01:00:40,177
Yes, and I got a passion
for socking cops.

1025
01:00:40,247 --> 01:00:42,841
- Where are they?
- Most of them are in cemeteries.

1026
01:00:42,917 --> 01:00:45,317
- Where is the necklace?
- Maybe I swallowed it.

1027
01:00:45,386 --> 01:00:48,355
You mustn't accuse Molly.
She's been with us a long time.

1028
01:00:48,422 --> 01:00:51,391
- That in itself is some recommendation.
- Thank you, Molly.

1029
01:00:51,458 --> 01:00:54,018
You're welcome.
I'll turn down the beds.

1030
01:00:54,094 --> 01:00:56,995
- Who is this Godfrey?
- He's the best butler we ever had.

1031
01:00:57,064 --> 01:01:00,227
Oh, I'm sure Godfrey didn't take them,
though we don't know much about him.

1032
01:01:00,301 --> 01:01:02,701
Godfrey wouldn't touch
those old pearls with a fork.

1033
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:05,796
Just a minute. What do you mean
you don't know much about him?

1034
01:01:05,873 --> 01:01:08,433
We didn't get him
from an employment agency.

1035
01:01:08,509 --> 01:01:11,307
- My sister found him on a city dump.
- Oh, I see.

1036
01:01:11,378 --> 01:01:14,472
- Are you accusing Godfrey?
- I only want my necklace.

1037
01:01:14,548 --> 01:01:17,847
It's so silly to think of Godfrey
wearing a pearl necklace.

1038
01:01:17,918 --> 01:01:20,580
- Where is this butler?
- He's probably in his room.

1039
01:01:20,654 --> 01:01:24,215
- Where is that?
- It's back this way.

1040
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:28,485
That's his room over there.

1041
01:01:28,562 --> 01:01:31,258
Godfrey, if you've got 'em,
hide 'em!

1042
01:01:31,332 --> 01:01:34,426
- Hey, what kind of a joint is this?
- All right, lady.

1043
01:01:38,706 --> 01:01:40,640
Hello, men.

1044
01:01:40,708 --> 01:01:42,642
- Where are they?
- Where?

1045
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:44,803
That's what I said.
Where?

1046
01:01:44,878 --> 01:01:47,642
#Where oh where
has my little dog gone #

1047
01:01:47,715 --> 01:01:50,445
Come on, snap out of it!

1048
01:01:50,517 --> 01:01:53,645
- You notice he's been drinking.
- He has not been drinking!

1049
01:01:53,721 --> 01:01:57,179
I don't blame him if he has.
This family's probably got to him too.

1050
01:01:57,257 --> 01:02:00,317
Do you mind if we search
your room, Godfrey?

1051
01:02:00,394 --> 01:02:02,624
Somebody lost?

1052
01:02:02,696 --> 01:02:05,130
There seems to be
a pearl necklace missing.

1053
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:08,032
- Do you know anything about it?
- Well, let's look for it.

1054
01:02:08,102 --> 01:02:10,263
- That's too bad.
- It's too bad for you.

1055
01:02:10,337 --> 01:02:13,500
I wouldn't be so cocksure of everything.
This is a serious matter.

1056
01:02:13,574 --> 01:02:15,838
<i>The pearls couldn't just
get up and walk away.</i>

1057
01:02:15,909 --> 01:02:18,377
She probably threw them
out of the taxi.

1058
01:02:18,445 --> 01:02:21,744
Let's look under the rug.
Maybe that's where I put it.

1059
01:02:21,815 --> 01:02:24,477
We'll do the searching,
Godfrey, old boy.

1060
01:02:24,551 --> 01:02:26,644
- It's a pleasure.
- This is all very silly.

1061
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,121
I can imagine a woman stealing pearls,
but what would Godfrey do with them?

1062
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:34,183
- Look under the mattress.
- Yes, there's a dandy place.

1063
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:45,904
<i>Well, they're not here.</i>

1064
01:02:45,973 --> 01:02:48,134
They must be there.

1065
01:02:48,208 --> 01:02:51,974
Just a minute. What makes you so sure
they oughta be under the mattress?

1066
01:02:52,046 --> 01:02:55,015
I read that that's where people
put things when they steal them.

1067
01:02:55,082 --> 01:02:58,848
<i>- Oh, yeah?
- Say, what are you up to?</i>

1068
01:02:58,919 --> 01:03:03,083
I'd like to talk to you boys outside
for just a minute, if you don't mind.

1069
01:03:08,662 --> 01:03:11,688
<i>- I'm terribly sorry, Godfrey.
- I told you so.</i>

1070
01:03:11,765 --> 01:03:16,702
<i>We're all terribly
sorry, Godfrey. Come, Cornelia.</i>

1071
01:03:20,707 --> 01:03:23,267
Yah, yah, yah, yah!

1072
01:03:27,481 --> 01:03:32,282
I wanna apologize for my family.
They're all slightly hysterical.

1073
01:03:32,352 --> 01:03:36,049
- We got an idea what you're up against.
- I'd like to let the matter drop.

1074
01:03:36,123 --> 01:03:40,219
She probably mislaid her necklace.
I'm not certain she had one.

1075
01:03:40,294 --> 01:03:42,558
There's something phony
about the whole thing.

1076
01:03:42,629 --> 01:03:45,063
That's all a mistake.
And if you don't mind,

1077
01:03:45,132 --> 01:03:48,067
I'd like to send a little check
tomorrow to the pension fund.

1078
01:03:48,135 --> 01:03:50,831
- Okay, Mr. Bullock. Thanks very much.
- Good night.

1079
01:03:50,904 --> 01:03:53,805
- The whole thing's forgotten.
- Good night, boys.

1080
01:03:58,045 --> 01:04:00,605
Just what have you got
to say for yourself?

1081
01:04:00,681 --> 01:04:03,149
Aren't they going to do
anything about it?

1082
01:04:03,217 --> 01:04:06,084
No, and it's a good thing
for you that they're not.

1083
01:04:06,153 --> 01:04:10,055
And something else. If you don't find
your necklace, the joke's on you...

1084
01:04:10,124 --> 01:04:12,991
because it's not insured.

1085
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:15,688
Cornelia lost her pearls,
and I've got mine!

1086
01:04:15,762 --> 01:04:18,196
Cornelia lost her pearls,
and I've got mine!

1087
01:04:18,265 --> 01:04:20,699
Cornelia lost her pearls,
and I've got mine!

1088
01:04:35,415 --> 01:04:39,249
Well, here we are, Tommy.
The village of forgotten men.

1089
01:04:39,319 --> 01:04:42,584
- How do you like it?
- I don't know but I prefer Newport.

1090
01:04:42,656 --> 01:04:46,251
It's a matter of choice.
Unfortunately, these men have no choice.

1091
01:04:46,326 --> 01:04:48,920
I still prefer Newport.

1092
01:04:48,996 --> 01:04:51,726
What is that
delightful aroma?

1093
01:04:51,798 --> 01:04:55,666
Oh, that's Old Man River.
You get used to it after a while.

1094
01:04:55,736 --> 01:04:58,569
Do you mean to say that people
really live in this place?

1095
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:00,766
Well, they go through
the motions.

1096
01:05:00,841 --> 01:05:03,742
Tommy, observe yon
structure on your left.

1097
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:07,371
That was the birthplace
of the celebrated butler Godfrey Smith.

1098
01:05:07,447 --> 01:05:11,281
- Where are the ashes of Godfrey Parke?
- Scattered to the winds.

1099
01:05:11,351 --> 01:05:13,785
- Hello, Duke. Well, well.
- Hiya, Mike.

1100
01:05:13,854 --> 01:05:16,550
- How's tricks?
- Meet Mr. Gray. Mr. Flaherty.

1101
01:05:16,623 --> 01:05:19,615
Mr. Gray, pardon my wet paw.
I've been washing my lingerie.

1102
01:05:19,693 --> 01:05:23,060
- That's okay.
- Hey, Bob, look who's here.

1103
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:27,328
<i>- Hi, Bob.
- Well, bust my false teeth!</i>

1104
01:05:27,401 --> 01:05:30,495
Say, thanks for the beans.
They got here just in time.

1105
01:05:30,571 --> 01:05:34,667
What's up? The beans was marvelous.
We ate everything but the can.

1106
01:05:34,741 --> 01:05:36,231
Don't thank me.
Thank Mr. Gray.

1107
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:38,244
He's got a corner
on the bean market.

1108
01:05:38,312 --> 01:05:40,712
Is that the same corner
that prosperity's just around?

1109
01:05:40,781 --> 01:05:43,272
No, that's another one.
Hello, Arthur.

1110
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:46,012
- Hello, Duke.
- Meet Mr. Gray. Mr. Bellinger.

1111
01:05:46,086 --> 01:05:48,816
You look as though you've got a job too.
Is this an epidemic?

1112
01:05:48,889 --> 01:05:51,153
<i>Hey, Mike. Let's get goin'.</i>

1113
01:05:51,225 --> 01:05:53,591
Duke, we gotta run along.
This is moving day.

1114
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:57,619
We gotta help the boys move their
shacks. The trucks are crowding in.

1115
01:05:57,698 --> 01:06:00,166
We oughta be in the river
by early spring.

1116
01:06:00,234 --> 01:06:03,829
We might be able to float
by that time. See you again.

1117
01:06:03,904 --> 01:06:05,838
Right.

1118
01:06:05,906 --> 01:06:09,842
That fellow with the bundle of wood
is Bellinger of the Second National.

1119
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:13,437
When his bank failed,
he gave up everything
so his depositors wouldn't suffer.

1120
01:06:13,513 --> 01:06:15,447
- Not really?
- Really.

1121
01:06:15,515 --> 01:06:18,075
There are two kinds of people:
Those who fight the idea...

1122
01:06:18,151 --> 01:06:20,847
of being pushed into the river
and the other kind.

1123
01:06:20,921 --> 01:06:23,617
After all, things have always
been this way for some people.

1124
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:25,851
These men are not
your responsibility.

1125
01:06:25,926 --> 01:06:27,951
There are different ways
of having fun.

1126
01:06:28,028 --> 01:06:30,155
You have a peculiar
sense of humor.

1127
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:32,664
Here we have some very
fashionable apartment houses,

1128
01:06:32,733 --> 01:06:35,065
over there is
a very swanky nightclub...

1129
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:37,535
while down here men starve
for want of a job.

1130
01:06:37,604 --> 01:06:40,505
- How does that strike you?
- What's this leading to?

1131
01:06:40,574 --> 01:06:43,441
Tommy, there's a very peculiar
mental process called thinking.

1132
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:45,603
You wouldn't know
much about that.

1133
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:48,113
But when I was living here,
I did a lot of it.

1134
01:06:48,181 --> 01:06:52,914
One thing I discovered was
that the only difference between
a derelict and a man is a job.

1135
01:06:52,986 --> 01:06:56,547
Sit down over here and rest your weary
bones. Let me tell you what I want.

1136
01:06:56,623 --> 01:06:59,888
Well, I'll listen, but I still think
you belong in a psychopathic ward.

1137
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:04,363
You may be right, but let me tell you
my plan, and listen with both ears.

1138
01:07:04,431 --> 01:07:06,365
I have an idea...

1139
01:07:41,268 --> 01:07:44,101
Did you and Irene have a good time
while you were in Europe?

1140
01:07:44,171 --> 01:07:46,799
Oh, as good a time as anyone
could have with Irene.

1141
01:07:46,873 --> 01:07:49,137
- You should be more civil to Carlo.
- Why?

1142
01:07:49,209 --> 01:07:51,939
<i>- I don't mind. Cherchez la femme.
- That will hold you.</i>

1143
01:07:52,012 --> 01:07:54,947
Carlo always has such a clever answer
for everything.

1144
01:07:55,015 --> 01:07:56,949
Darling, do you want
some coffee?

1145
01:07:57,017 --> 01:07:58,951
- No, thank you.
- She didn't eat any dinner, either.

1146
01:07:59,019 --> 01:08:00,953
- You had plenty.
- I can't say anything!

1147
01:08:01,021 --> 01:08:03,114
- You never do.
- Oh, what's come over you?

1148
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:05,317
We spend good money
to send you abroad,

1149
01:08:05,392 --> 01:08:07,553
and you're worse off
than when you left.

1150
01:08:07,627 --> 01:08:09,891
<i>- Her liver is probably upset.
- Take a liver pill.</i>

1151
01:08:09,963 --> 01:08:13,126
- I don't want a liver pill.
- You mustn't get upset.

1152
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,963
You've broken many before
and never acted this way.

1153
01:08:15,035 --> 01:08:19,972
She's upset because Godfrey didn't fall
down in a faint when we got in today.

1154
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:22,304
Why should Godfrey
fall in a faint?

1155
01:08:22,376 --> 01:08:24,970
He didn't make enough fuss
over her homecoming to suit her.

1156
01:08:25,045 --> 01:08:27,411
Well, Godfrey's
not the fussing kind. Shh.

1157
01:08:27,481 --> 01:08:31,440
Godfrey, I was just telling my daughters
you missed them while they were away.

1158
01:08:31,518 --> 01:08:33,611
Oh, yes, I did.
Very much, indeed.

1159
01:08:33,687 --> 01:08:36,315
- We missed you too, didn't we, Irene?
- Yes.

1160
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:39,985
- I missed you, also.
- It's nice to miss everybody.

1161
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:42,824
Then it makes it so nice
when we get together again.

1162
01:08:42,896 --> 01:08:45,194
There, there, darling.
It's nice to see you cheerful.

1163
01:08:45,265 --> 01:08:47,995
- You do have a way with you, Godfrey.
- Thank you.

1164
01:08:48,068 --> 01:08:50,969
There's no use denying the fact
that Godfrey has a way with him.

1165
01:08:51,037 --> 01:08:54,006
We must be running on.
Cornelia, cheer her up.

1166
01:08:54,074 --> 01:08:56,008
I'm a cinch.

1167
01:08:56,076 --> 01:08:58,840
Do you feel better now that
you know Godfrey missed us?

1168
01:08:58,912 --> 01:09:01,813
He missed me more.
I could tell by the light in his eyes.

1169
01:09:01,882 --> 01:09:04,350
Why don't throw yourself
in the man's arms?

1170
01:09:04,418 --> 01:09:06,545
You can't rush a man
like Godfrey.

1171
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:08,815
You're getting
pretty old, you know?

1172
01:09:08,889 --> 01:09:11,824
He's really in love.
He's just hard to break down.

1173
01:09:11,892 --> 01:09:14,588
I could break him down
in no time at all.

1174
01:09:14,661 --> 01:09:17,095
- He'd have nothing to do with you.
- How do you know?

1175
01:09:17,164 --> 01:09:19,962
Because he wouldn't.
Don't you try anything.

1176
01:09:20,033 --> 01:09:23,002
I'm not saying I will,
and I'm not saying I won't

1177
01:09:23,069 --> 01:09:26,232
Come to think of it, Godfrey and
I have a little unfinished business.

1178
01:09:26,306 --> 01:09:30,436
You better leave it unfinished, unless
you want to be wearing a lamp for a hat.

1179
01:09:41,955 --> 01:09:44,788
Did you mean it
when you said you missed me?

1180
01:09:44,858 --> 01:09:47,326
Oh! Yes,
of course I did.

1181
01:09:47,394 --> 01:09:50,124
I mean, did you miss
Cornelia and me or just me?

1182
01:09:50,197 --> 01:09:53,132
- Well, I missed both of you.
- Not just me?

1183
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:56,363
Oh, I may have missed you a little
more than I did Cornelia. Why?

1184
01:09:56,436 --> 01:09:59,803
I'm glad, because if you missed Cornelia
more, you'd probably miss me less.

1185
01:09:59,873 --> 01:10:02,603
- That sounds very logical.
- That's all I wanted to know.

1186
01:10:02,676 --> 01:10:06,077
- You look so cute in your apron.
- I'm not trying to look cute.

1187
01:10:06,146 --> 01:10:09,081
Molly has a cold,
and I'm doubling for her.

1188
01:10:09,149 --> 01:10:11,743
What's funny about that?

1189
01:10:11,818 --> 01:10:13,945
- She hasn't got a cold.
- No?

1190
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:17,956
She's got the same thing I've got,
only you won't let me talk about that.

1191
01:10:18,024 --> 01:10:21,084
- You'll lose your temper.
- Well, not seriously.

1192
01:10:21,161 --> 01:10:24,460
- Will you let me do something?
- What do you want to do?

1193
01:10:24,531 --> 01:10:26,761
- Wipe.
- Oh, all right.

1194
01:10:26,833 --> 01:10:29,927
- You can tell me all about your trip.
- You won't get mad?

1195
01:10:30,003 --> 01:10:33,939
- Why should I?
- Because everybody was Godfrey.

1196
01:10:34,007 --> 01:10:36,942
Every... I don't want
to seem dull,

1197
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:40,673
but I do seem to have a little trouble
following you at times.

1198
01:10:40,747 --> 01:10:43,409
Well, for instance, when I'd go
into a restaurant in Paris,

1199
01:10:43,483 --> 01:10:45,951
I'd close my eyes and say,
"The waiter is Godfrey.

1200
01:10:46,019 --> 01:10:48,078
I'm home, and he's
serving me dinner. "

1201
01:10:48,154 --> 01:10:50,850
- It made everything taste better.
- Why?

1202
01:10:50,924 --> 01:10:53,893
- Haven't you any sense?
- I'm afraid I haven't.

1203
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,793
When I'd get in a cab,
the driver was Godfrey,

1204
01:10:56,863 --> 01:10:58,956
and I'd say,
"This is his chariot,

1205
01:10:59,032 --> 01:11:01,296
and he's taking me
to his castle on the mountains. "

1206
01:11:01,368 --> 01:11:05,464
Suppose you come down out of the
mountains and tell me about your trip.

1207
01:11:05,539 --> 01:11:09,737
We went to Venice, and I went for a ride
in one of those rowboats.

1208
01:11:09,809 --> 01:11:12,801
Not a matador. That was in Spain.
But something like a matador.

1209
01:11:12,879 --> 01:11:14,972
Do you, by any chance,
mean a gondolier?

1210
01:11:15,048 --> 01:11:18,484
That was the name of the boat. The man
that pushed it sang a beautiful song.

1211
01:11:18,552 --> 01:11:21,350
- It was beautiful.
- I see.

1212
01:11:21,421 --> 01:11:25,482
- So the man was Godfrey.
- I didn't even mind the smell.

1213
01:11:25,559 --> 01:11:29,723
It was very convenient to take a trip
abroad without leaving the kitchen.

1214
01:11:29,796 --> 01:11:32,560
Oh, you have a wonderful sense of humor.
I wish I had a sense of humor.

1215
01:11:32,632 --> 01:11:35,499
But I never can think
of the right thing to say.

1216
01:11:35,569 --> 01:11:39,471
Do you mind if I talk for a little bit,
while you catch your breath?

1217
01:11:39,539 --> 01:11:41,837
I'd love it.

1218
01:11:41,908 --> 01:11:45,503
While you've been away,
I've been doing some things also.

1219
01:11:45,579 --> 01:11:49,174
I've been trying to do things that
I thought would make you proud of me.

1220
01:11:49,249 --> 01:11:51,717
Oh, I was proud of you
before I went away.

1221
01:11:51,785 --> 01:11:54,253
Yes, but I mean
prouder still.

1222
01:11:54,321 --> 01:11:57,688
You see, you helped me
to find myself,

1223
01:11:57,757 --> 01:11:59,691
and I'm very grateful.

1224
01:11:59,759 --> 01:12:02,250
You'd make a wonderful husband.

1225
01:12:02,329 --> 01:12:04,320
I'm afraid not.

1226
01:12:04,397 --> 01:12:08,629
- I know how you feel about things.
- How?

1227
01:12:08,702 --> 01:12:12,763
Well, you're grateful to me because I
helped you to beat Cornelia,

1228
01:12:12,839 --> 01:12:17,071
and I'm grateful to you
because you helped me to beat life.

1229
01:12:17,143 --> 01:12:20,044
But that doesn't mean that
we have to fall in love.

1230
01:12:20,113 --> 01:12:23,241
If you don't want to,
but I'd make a wonderful wife.

1231
01:12:23,316 --> 01:12:26,114
Well, not for me,
I'm afraid.

1232
01:12:26,186 --> 01:12:29,087
You see, I like you very much.

1233
01:12:29,155 --> 01:12:32,556
But I had a very bitter experience.

1234
01:12:34,461 --> 01:12:36,395
But I won't bore you with that.

1235
01:12:36,463 --> 01:12:39,091
- Maybe she wasn't in love with you.
- Well, maybe not.

1236
01:12:39,165 --> 01:12:42,157
However, that's
beside the point.

1237
01:12:42,235 --> 01:12:44,795
You and I are friends.

1238
01:12:44,871 --> 01:12:47,806
I feel a certain
responsibility to you.

1239
01:12:47,874 --> 01:12:50,934
- That's why I wanted to tell you first.
- Tell me what?

1240
01:12:51,011 --> 01:12:55,448
Well, I thought it was about time
that I was moving on.

1241
01:12:55,515 --> 01:12:57,608
Godfrey!

1242
01:12:57,684 --> 01:13:00,244
Now, please.

1243
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,914
- I won't cry, I promise.
- That's fine.

1244
01:13:02,989 --> 01:13:05,116
After all,
I'm your protege.

1245
01:13:05,191 --> 01:13:07,921
- You want me to improve myself?
- Yes.

1246
01:13:07,994 --> 01:13:11,088
You don't want me to go on being
just a butler all my life, do you?

1247
01:13:11,164 --> 01:13:14,361
- I want you to be anything you want.
- Well, that's very sweet.

1248
01:13:14,434 --> 01:13:17,665
- When are you leaving?
- Oh, pretty soon.

1249
01:13:17,737 --> 01:13:20,297
But I'll call you up
every now and then.

1250
01:13:20,373 --> 01:13:23,308
We'll have long chats.
I'll tell you how I'm getting on.

1251
01:13:23,376 --> 01:13:26,743
- Oh, we'll have lots of fun.
- Are you going back to her?

1252
01:13:26,813 --> 01:13:29,941
- To whom?
- That Indian woman.

1253
01:13:30,016 --> 01:13:32,780
Indian... Oh!

1254
01:13:32,852 --> 01:13:35,980
She was just
a fabrication.

1255
01:13:36,056 --> 01:13:39,514
Oh! Then, you weren't
married to her?

1256
01:13:39,592 --> 01:13:43,050
No, she was just a product
ofTommy Gray's imagination.

1257
01:13:43,129 --> 01:13:46,326
- Then there wasn't any?
- No!

1258
01:13:46,399 --> 01:13:49,163
Well, there couldn't
have been five children.

1259
01:13:49,235 --> 01:13:51,760
Well, naturally.

1260
01:13:51,838 --> 01:13:54,238
That makes a difference.

1261
01:13:56,976 --> 01:13:59,774
Yeah, that makes
a difference.

1262
01:14:02,048 --> 01:14:03,982
Did you ring, miss?

1263
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:06,780
You needn't be so formal
when we're alone.

1264
01:14:06,853 --> 01:14:09,822
Shouldn't that rather increase
a butler's formality?

1265
01:14:09,889 --> 01:14:12,653
- But you're not a butler.
- I'm sorry if I've disappointed.

1266
01:14:12,726 --> 01:14:15,661
You might drop that superior
attitude for a moment.

1267
01:14:15,729 --> 01:14:18,960
There's a little matter I've wanted to
talk over with you for quite a while...

1268
01:14:19,032 --> 01:14:21,227
called "The Mystery
of Milady's Necklace"...

1269
01:14:21,301 --> 01:14:23,895
or "What Happened
to the Pearls?"

1270
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:27,667
Pearls? Necklace? Oh, you mean the
one that disappeared last fall?

1271
01:14:27,741 --> 01:14:29,675
- The same.
- Didn't that ever turn up?

1272
01:14:29,743 --> 01:14:32,371
Oh, yes, it turned up,
but not in my possession.

1273
01:14:32,445 --> 01:14:36,279
I know the first part of the story, but
I wondered what you know might know?

1274
01:14:36,349 --> 01:14:39,807
- I can't imagine.
- One other story might interest you.

1275
01:14:39,886 --> 01:14:41,911
I met some people
on the boat coming over.

1276
01:14:41,988 --> 01:14:43,979
A Boston family,
quite distinguished.

1277
01:14:44,057 --> 01:14:47,788
They knew a great deal
about a family called... the Parkes.

1278
01:14:47,861 --> 01:14:50,352
<i>The old Mayflower crowd.
Very upper crust too.</i>

1279
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:52,728
Never been a breath
of scandal.

1280
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:56,701
<i>It would be an awful shame to see
them made the laughing stock of Boston.</i>

1281
01:14:56,770 --> 01:14:59,364
I should hate to see anyone
made a laughing stock.

1282
01:14:59,439 --> 01:15:02,738
Let's you and I take a long taxi ride
out Van Cortland Way.

1283
01:15:02,809 --> 01:15:05,073
<i>Perhaps we could
exchange secrets.</i>

1284
01:15:05,145 --> 01:15:08,171
- Is that a command?
- As you like.

1285
01:15:08,248 --> 01:15:11,081
I'll be waiting
around the corner.

1286
01:15:11,151 --> 01:15:15,212
Which corner?
This one or that one?

1287
01:15:15,288 --> 01:15:17,882
This corner.

1288
01:15:17,957 --> 01:15:20,926
It's impossible to exchange
intimate secrets here.

1289
01:15:20,994 --> 01:15:24,828
The traffic's almost as heavy as it is
at Grand Central Station.

1290
01:15:24,898 --> 01:15:28,163
Don't forget, darling.
Fifteen minutes.

1291
01:15:33,406 --> 01:15:36,739
Please, Godfrey,
you can't go with Cornelia.

1292
01:15:36,810 --> 01:15:39,574
But I didn't say I was going
anyplace with Miss Cornelia.

1293
01:15:39,646 --> 01:15:43,309
I know, but you will. She always
makes everybody do just as she likes.

1294
01:15:43,383 --> 01:15:46,318
But why should you care
whether I meet her or not?

1295
01:15:46,386 --> 01:15:50,186
I do care, that's why.
Cornelia's the one who doesn't care.

1296
01:15:50,256 --> 01:15:53,089
I think I should decide
those things for myself.

1297
01:15:53,159 --> 01:15:56,060
Oh, Godfrey, I don't want
to be annoying, but I... Oh!

1298
01:15:56,129 --> 01:16:00,498
Oh, see here...
You-You can't do that.

1299
01:16:00,567 --> 01:16:03,593
Uh, please, snap out of it.

1300
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:08,437
Ohhh, this is
the craziest family.

1301
01:16:30,797 --> 01:16:34,392
Now see here, stop this nonsense.
Do you hear?

1302
01:16:34,467 --> 01:16:38,198
If you're faking one of your spells
to keep me from meeting Cornelia,

1303
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:40,535
you're on the wrong track,
you hear?

1304
01:16:40,607 --> 01:16:42,541
- Do you hear?
- Mmm.

1305
01:16:46,646 --> 01:16:49,308
Must be some smelling salts.

1306
01:17:06,432 --> 01:17:09,333
Are you feeling better?
No?

1307
01:17:11,237 --> 01:17:13,865
Just a minute.

1308
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:17,239
Godfrey knows how to take care
of little Irene.

1309
01:17:17,310 --> 01:17:19,244
Yes, indeed.

1310
01:17:21,681 --> 01:17:25,777
Just lie there quietly, and Godfrey
will take care of everything.

1311
01:17:25,852 --> 01:17:29,151
Godfrey knows just how
to take care...

1312
01:17:29,222 --> 01:17:31,952
of these nasty old faints.

1313
01:17:32,025 --> 01:17:35,256
That's the girl.
Come right up here.

1314
01:17:35,328 --> 01:17:39,492
There you are.
Godfrey will soon fix Irene.

1315
01:17:39,565 --> 01:17:43,501
Yes, indeed.
Just leave everything to Godfrey.

1316
01:17:43,569 --> 01:17:46,333
Godfrey will take care
of everything.

1317
01:17:46,406 --> 01:17:49,773
Now, you just sit right down
there like a good girl,

1318
01:17:49,842 --> 01:17:53,141
and in just a minute
you'll forget that you had any trouble.

1319
01:17:53,212 --> 01:17:56,272
I thought so. Let that be a lesson.

1320
01:17:56,349 --> 01:17:59,318
Godrey! Oh, Godfrey,
don't go away!

1321
01:17:59,385 --> 01:18:02,411
Oh, Godfrey,
now I know you love me.

1322
01:18:02,488 --> 01:18:05,651
- I do not love you!
- You do!

1323
01:18:05,725 --> 01:18:08,159
What is the meaning of this,
may I ask?

1324
01:18:08,227 --> 01:18:11,253
- Godfrey loves me!
- What are you talking about?

1325
01:18:11,331 --> 01:18:14,300
- Godfrey loves me!
- Godfrey, I demand an explanation!

1326
01:18:14,367 --> 01:18:18,133
- I think perhaps I had better resign.
- Yes, that's a good idea.

1327
01:18:18,204 --> 01:18:22,140
- What do you think your father'd say?
- I don't care. Godfrey loves me.

1328
01:18:22,208 --> 01:18:25,177
You put on some dry clothes
and come downstairs.

1329
01:18:25,244 --> 01:18:28,680
- Godfrey loves me!
- I never heard anything like this!

1330
01:18:49,335 --> 01:18:53,465
Shut that thing off!
I feel gloomy enough as it is!

1331
01:19:01,714 --> 01:19:04,239
- Something terrible has happened.
- What?

1332
01:19:04,317 --> 01:19:07,218
- Godfrey pushed Irene into a shower.
- What's terrible about that?

1333
01:19:07,286 --> 01:19:10,278
He's in love with her. I can't make
head nor tail out of the whole thing.

1334
01:19:10,356 --> 01:19:12,950
I can't make head nor tail
out of what you're saying.

1335
01:19:13,026 --> 01:19:15,290
The only thing is to send
him back where he came from.

1336
01:19:15,361 --> 01:19:17,625
Imagine, falling in love
with a butler.

1337
01:19:17,697 --> 01:19:20,632
If you're going to feel sorry
for anyone, feel sorry for Godfrey.

1338
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:24,363
- Alexander!
- Don't "Alexander" me!

1339
01:19:24,437 --> 01:19:26,735
I've got something
more important to talk about.

1340
01:19:26,806 --> 01:19:29,570
Don't tell me you're going
to talk about money matters.

1341
01:19:29,642 --> 01:19:32,304
- Money, money, money!
- Yes, I am. But before I start,

1342
01:19:32,378 --> 01:19:34,869
I'm going to have
a little talk with Carlo.

1343
01:19:34,947 --> 01:19:39,043
- What are you going to do?
- This is private, just for Carlo's ears.

1344
01:19:40,653 --> 01:19:44,248
You don't mind if we have
a little chat, Carlo, old boy?

1345
01:19:44,323 --> 01:19:47,850
You know, for some time,
Carlo, I've felt...

1346
01:19:53,566 --> 01:19:56,592
- What did you say to Carlo?
- I said good-bye.

1347
01:19:56,669 --> 01:19:59,604
- Did he go?
- He left through the side window.

1348
01:19:59,672 --> 01:20:02,038
<i>- Where is he going?
- I don't know, but he won't be back.</i>

1349
01:20:02,108 --> 01:20:05,043
- Now, sit down and do some listening.
- I've never seen you like this.

1350
01:20:05,111 --> 01:20:07,341
Sit down!
What's come over you?

1351
01:20:07,413 --> 01:20:10,746
- You're just in time to listen.
- Do you want Godfrey to listen?

1352
01:20:10,817 --> 01:20:13,911
Yes, I want Godfrey to listen.
This concerns him too.

1353
01:20:13,986 --> 01:20:17,353
You might as well all know,
point-blank, we're about broke.

1354
01:20:17,423 --> 01:20:19,516
You mean we haven't
any money left?

1355
01:20:19,592 --> 01:20:22,652
We've got this house, a few odds
and ends, and that's about all.

1356
01:20:22,728 --> 01:20:25,754
Not only that, I've lost all of my stock
in Bullock Enterprises.

1357
01:20:25,832 --> 01:20:29,233
<i>I've borrowed some of the stockholder's
money trying to recoup my losses.</i>

1358
01:20:29,302 --> 01:20:32,237
I don't know where I'm going to end up.
Maybe in jail.

1359
01:20:32,305 --> 01:20:34,899
- Alexander!
- But if I do end up in jail,

1360
01:20:34,974 --> 01:20:37,602
it'll be the first peace
I've had in 20 years.

1361
01:20:37,677 --> 01:20:40,043
And I don't want any of you
to chortle about Godfrey.

1362
01:20:40,113 --> 01:20:42,047
You may all end up on the dump.

1363
01:20:42,115 --> 01:20:45,141
<i>- What are we going to do?
- May I intrude, sir?</i>

1364
01:20:45,218 --> 01:20:48,312
I'm afraid things are not
as bad as you make out.

1365
01:20:48,387 --> 01:20:50,878
- What do you know about it?
- Well, sir,

1366
01:20:50,957 --> 01:20:55,087
I've known for a long time the Bullock
interests were in rather a bad way.

1367
01:20:55,161 --> 01:20:58,062
I offered to help you once,
but you declined that help.

1368
01:20:58,131 --> 01:21:02,568
So I took the liberty of dabbling in the
market on my own account. Here, sir.

1369
01:21:02,635 --> 01:21:05,263
<i>- What's this?
- That's most of your stock.</i>

1370
01:21:05,338 --> 01:21:08,330
I knew it had been dumped
on the market, so I sold short.

1371
01:21:08,407 --> 01:21:11,865
I don't understand. You sold short.
You mean gentlemen's underwear?

1372
01:21:11,944 --> 01:21:15,971
Wait! You mean that you've been making
money while I was losing it?

1373
01:21:16,048 --> 01:21:19,575
I did it in your interest, sir.
The stock has been endorsed over to you.

1374
01:21:21,487 --> 01:21:25,719
I don't understand.
You did this for me?

1375
01:21:25,791 --> 01:21:29,625
Well, sir, there comes a turning point
in every man's life.

1376
01:21:29,695 --> 01:21:33,187
A time when he needs help.
It happened to me, also.

1377
01:21:33,266 --> 01:21:37,100
This family helped me
I hope I repaid my debt.

1378
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:41,129
Some of the money went into a project
of my own. I hope you won't mind.

1379
01:21:41,207 --> 01:21:44,404
Do you mean that you did
all that on $150 a month?

1380
01:21:44,477 --> 01:21:48,311
Well, hardly. You see,
with the aid ofTommy Gray,

1381
01:21:48,381 --> 01:21:52,818
I was able to transmute
a certain trinket into gold,

1382
01:21:52,885 --> 01:21:56,286
then into stock
and then back into pearls again.

1383
01:21:56,355 --> 01:21:59,119
Thank you, dear lady,
for the use of this trinket.

1384
01:21:59,192 --> 01:22:01,956
Oh, Godfrey!
Then you did steal them!

1385
01:22:02,028 --> 01:22:06,021
Well, I, uh... Perhaps Miss Cornelia
had better explain that.

1386
01:22:06,098 --> 01:22:09,534
- You win.
- What is this all about, anyway?

1387
01:22:09,602 --> 01:22:12,662
I put the pearls
under Godfrey's mattress.

1388
01:22:12,738 --> 01:22:15,298
Thank you, Miss Cornelia.
I wanted you to say that.

1389
01:22:15,374 --> 01:22:18,366
<i>- But why?
- You wouldn't understand.</i>

1390
01:22:18,444 --> 01:22:21,038
Here, Godfrey.
These are rightfully yours.

1391
01:22:21,113 --> 01:22:24,742
Oh, no, thank you. I repaid my debt,
and I'm grateful to all of you.

1392
01:22:24,817 --> 01:22:28,048
If anyone's indebted, we are, after
the way some of us have treated you.

1393
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:32,989
I've been repaid in many ways.
I learned patience from Mr. Bullock.

1394
01:22:33,059 --> 01:22:37,189
I found Mrs. Bullock
at all times, shall we say, amusing.

1395
01:22:37,263 --> 01:22:41,700
That's complimentary, and don't forget
you said I looked as young as Cornelia.

1396
01:22:41,767 --> 01:22:45,601
- What good did you find in me, if any?
- A great deal.

1397
01:22:45,671 --> 01:22:49,607
You taught me the fallacy of
false pride. You taught me humility.

1398
01:22:49,675 --> 01:22:52,701
I don't understand you.

1399
01:22:52,778 --> 01:22:56,612
Miss Cornelia, there have been other
spoiled children in the world.

1400
01:22:56,682 --> 01:22:59,412
I happened to be
one of them myself.

1401
01:22:59,485 --> 01:23:01,680
You're a high-spirited girl.

1402
01:23:01,754 --> 01:23:06,191
I can only hope that you use those
high spirits in a more constructive way.

1403
01:23:06,259 --> 01:23:09,956
And so... good day.

1404
01:23:22,942 --> 01:23:25,308
You know,
I hate to see Godfrey go.

1405
01:23:25,378 --> 01:23:28,472
He's the only butler we ever had
who understood women.

1406
01:23:31,284 --> 01:23:34,685
Well, Molly, you told me to leave
my hat near the door. Remember?

1407
01:23:34,754 --> 01:23:37,120
I hate to see you leave,
Godfrey.

1408
01:23:37,189 --> 01:23:40,886
- Oh, Molly, you've been swell.
- The house will seem empty.

1409
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:45,021
Well, I guess the best
friends have to part.

1410
01:23:45,097 --> 01:23:47,793
Will you say good-bye
to Miss Irene for me?

1411
01:23:47,867 --> 01:23:51,030
I don't think I can go through
that ordeal right now.

1412
01:23:52,772 --> 01:23:55,832
You're sweet, Molly.

1413
01:23:55,908 --> 01:23:57,842
Good-bye.

1414
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:10,016
What is it?

1415
01:24:10,089 --> 01:24:13,752
What's the matter
with Cornelia?

1416
01:24:17,963 --> 01:24:21,194
What's the matter with everybody?
Mother, what's the trouble?

1417
01:24:21,267 --> 01:24:23,292
- He's gone.
- Who's gone?

1418
01:24:23,369 --> 01:24:25,428
- Godfrey.
- Where?

1419
01:24:25,504 --> 01:24:28,200
And Carlo's gone out of the window.
Everybody's gone!

1420
01:24:28,274 --> 01:24:31,107
Oh, Molly, has he gone?

1421
01:24:31,177 --> 01:24:33,907
Poor Molly.
He's not gonna get away from me.

1422
01:24:33,979 --> 01:24:36,447
Order the car, Molly.
I'll be right down.

1423
01:24:43,356 --> 01:24:45,916
- Hello, Duke.
- Hi, Mike.

1424
01:24:45,991 --> 01:24:48,687
Say, business
looks pretty good tonight.

1425
01:24:48,761 --> 01:24:52,219
I'll say it is. Mayor Courtney's
here tonight with a big party.

1426
01:24:52,298 --> 01:24:55,734
I'll have one of the boys
bring these down, Duke.

1427
01:25:02,575 --> 01:25:05,942
- Hello, Duke.
- Hello. We can't complain about this.

1428
01:25:06,011 --> 01:25:08,536
Complain? Why, we got
the Meriwethers here!

1429
01:25:08,614 --> 01:25:11,777
- So I heard.
- Big stuff, huh?

1430
01:25:11,851 --> 01:25:14,081
This is all Greek to me.

1431
01:25:14,153 --> 01:25:16,747
Oh, here's our wandering butler now.
Explain it to him.

1432
01:25:16,822 --> 01:25:18,756
- Hello, Duke.
- Arthur.

1433
01:25:18,824 --> 01:25:22,089
I've got an estimate from the contractor
on your housing plan for the winter.

1434
01:25:22,161 --> 01:25:26,495
He figures he can petition off
our present buildings into compartments,

1435
01:25:26,565 --> 01:25:28,726
take care of
at least 50 people.

1436
01:25:28,801 --> 01:25:31,964
It'll cost $5,800,
but that includes steam heat.

1437
01:25:32,037 --> 01:25:35,529
Forgotten men with steam. Sounds like
something that ought to be on the menu.

1438
01:25:35,608 --> 01:25:38,441
I'll talk with you
about it later, Arthur.

1439
01:25:38,511 --> 01:25:42,106
I've still got an interest in this
company. When do you pay dividends?

1440
01:25:42,181 --> 01:25:46,413
We're giving food and shelter to 50
in the winter and employment in summer.

1441
01:25:46,485 --> 01:25:49,852
- What more do you want?
- You're the most arbitrary butler ever.

1442
01:25:49,922 --> 01:25:51,856
- Ex-butler.
- Fired?

1443
01:25:51,924 --> 01:25:55,860
I quit. I felt that
foolish feeling coming on again.

1444
01:25:55,928 --> 01:25:58,920
- You mean Irene?
- What do you know about that?

1445
01:25:58,998 --> 01:26:02,695
Nobody knows anything about her love,
except all of Upper New York.

1446
01:26:02,768 --> 01:26:04,827
Guess I got out
just in time.

1447
01:26:04,904 --> 01:26:07,134
Why don't you marry
the girl?

1448
01:26:07,206 --> 01:26:10,232
- I've had enough of matrimony.
- What's wrong with butlers?

1449
01:26:10,309 --> 01:26:13,142
Lots of society girls
run away with their chauffeurs.

1450
01:26:13,212 --> 01:26:16,739
Never mind about that. Suppose
you write me out a check for $5,000?

1451
01:26:16,816 --> 01:26:19,080
- For what?
- A new dock.

1452
01:26:19,151 --> 01:26:21,642
Perhaps we'll get
some of the yachting trade.

1453
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:23,813
Well, how about
an airplane landing?

1454
01:26:23,889 --> 01:26:26,653
We'll come to that later.

1455
01:26:35,801 --> 01:26:38,736
Say, mister, what happened
to the city dump that was here?

1456
01:26:38,804 --> 01:26:41,568
Well, this is it, but
most of it's been filled in.

1457
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:44,768
- What happened to those forgotten men?
- Forgotten men?

1458
01:26:44,844 --> 01:26:48,610
- Oh, we got most of them out in time.
- Where's Godfrey?

1459
01:26:48,681 --> 01:26:51,275
- You mean Mr. Godfrey Smith?
- Yes.

1460
01:26:51,350 --> 01:26:54,786
Well, lady, his office is right over
there where it says "office. "

1461
01:26:54,854 --> 01:26:58,415
Oh, just where it used to be.
Thank you. Come on, Clarence.

1462
01:26:58,491 --> 01:27:01,688
Say, wait a minute!
What is this? A basket party?

1463
01:27:05,498 --> 01:27:08,092
- Good evening, Mr. Courtney.
- Good evening.

1464
01:27:08,167 --> 01:27:10,431
- Lovely evening.
- Yes.

1465
01:27:10,503 --> 01:27:12,630
Good evening.

1466
01:27:12,705 --> 01:27:16,004
Well, there you are.
Business is fine.

1467
01:27:16,075 --> 01:27:20,774
I'm stuck, you're nuts,
and I'm going back to Boston
before I disgrace my family.

1468
01:27:20,846 --> 01:27:24,782
- Good riddance.
- Oh, Godfrey, company has come.

1469
01:27:24,850 --> 01:27:28,217
<i>- Hello.
- What are you doing here?</i>

1470
01:27:28,287 --> 01:27:31,188
Yes, what are you doing here?
Don't let him off the hook.

1471
01:27:31,257 --> 01:27:33,817
You must leave at once.
Do you hear me?

1472
01:27:33,893 --> 01:27:39,058
We got rid of her. If I can help
you in any other way, let me know.

1473
01:27:39,131 --> 01:27:43,067
Oh, my, how you've
fixed this place up, Godfrey.

1474
01:27:43,135 --> 01:27:46,730
- It's much nicer than before.
- Oh, you noticed that?

1475
01:27:46,805 --> 01:27:50,172
- Are the forgotten men having a party?
- It's their annual reunion.

1476
01:27:50,242 --> 01:27:53,939
- I saw the mayor. Is he one too?
- He's the guest of honor.

1477
01:27:54,013 --> 01:27:57,107
Oh, it's a lovely view.

1478
01:27:57,182 --> 01:28:00,618
- The bridge is always there?
- Most always.

1479
01:28:00,686 --> 01:28:03,712
Oh, you have a kitchen!
I'm gonna like this place.

1480
01:28:03,789 --> 01:28:06,690
What's over here?
Oh, is this where you sleep?

1481
01:28:06,759 --> 01:28:10,991
That's the general purpose
of the room. Any observations?

1482
01:28:11,063 --> 01:28:14,430
I think it's very cute,
but we'll have to change the wallpaper.

1483
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:17,469
- What do you mean "we"?
- Oh, I don't like green wallpaper.

1484
01:28:17,536 --> 01:28:20,562
You won't have to look at it.
You're going home right now.

1485
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:22,834
- Oh, but I can't go home.
- Why not?

1486
01:28:22,908 --> 01:28:26,207
- I can't go home after what happened.
- What happened?

1487
01:28:26,278 --> 01:28:29,111
You know what happened
just as well as I do.

1488
01:28:29,181 --> 01:28:32,514
- Now see here...
- Oh, go on and lose your temper.

1489
01:28:32,585 --> 01:28:35,019
I love it when
you lose your temper.

1490
01:28:35,087 --> 01:28:37,021
Why can't you let me alone?

1491
01:28:37,089 --> 01:28:40,354
Because you're my responsibility,
and someone has to take care of you.

1492
01:28:40,426 --> 01:28:44,055
- I can take care of myself.
- Look me in the eye and say that.

1493
01:28:44,129 --> 01:28:46,393
You love me,
and you know it.

1494
01:28:46,465 --> 01:28:49,434
There's no sense in struggling against
a thing when it's got you.

1495
01:28:49,501 --> 01:28:51,025
<i>That's all there is to it.</i>

1496
01:28:51,103 --> 01:28:53,037
Oh, that's Clarence.

1497
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:57,431
I'm sorry I was delayed,
Miss Irene.

1498
01:28:57,509 --> 01:29:00,034
<i>- I had to go around the back way.
- Put the wood over there.</i>

1499
01:29:00,112 --> 01:29:03,411
You can put the groceries
right there in the kitchen.

1500
01:29:03,482 --> 01:29:06,212
- That's fine. Thank you, Clarence.
- What's the idea?

1501
01:29:06,285 --> 01:29:09,379
I brought some wood and food.
It should last us for a week.

1502
01:29:09,455 --> 01:29:12,913
It's a wonder you didn't bring
a minister and license.

1503
01:29:12,992 --> 01:29:15,222
<i>I never thought of that.</i>

1504
01:29:15,294 --> 01:29:17,387
- May I come in?
- Oh, Mr. Courtney.

1505
01:29:17,463 --> 01:29:21,263
Mr. Gray said there were a couple of
people here who wanted to get married.

1506
01:29:21,333 --> 01:29:24,996
- Are you it?
- Can you marry us without a license?

1507
01:29:25,070 --> 01:29:27,300
It may get me
into a lot of trouble,

1508
01:29:27,373 --> 01:29:29,807
but I guess I've known
your family long enough.

1509
01:29:29,875 --> 01:29:32,901
- Who are you going to marry?
- Godfrey. This is Godfrey.

1510
01:29:32,978 --> 01:29:36,846
Oh. How do you do, Godfrey?

1511
01:29:36,915 --> 01:29:39,315
Does your father
know about this?

1512
01:29:39,385 --> 01:29:42,081
Everybody knows about it
except Godfrey.

1513
01:29:42,154 --> 01:29:44,987
Well, I guess we better
have a witness.

1514
01:29:45,057 --> 01:29:48,424
- Clarence, stand right down here.
- What?

1515
01:29:48,494 --> 01:29:52,260
That's fine. Right there.
Come on, Godfrey. Right there.

1516
01:29:52,331 --> 01:29:55,630
Well, now, uh,
join hands, please.

1517
01:29:55,701 --> 01:29:58,363
- No, the right hand.
- Oh.

1518
01:29:58,437 --> 01:30:01,372
Stand still, Godfrey.
It'll all be over in a minute.
