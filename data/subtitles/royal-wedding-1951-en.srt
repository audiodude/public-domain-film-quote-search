1
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:30,800
What is it, Phipps?

2
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,833
The Duke of Landguard
to see His Majesty.

3
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:34,967
His Majesty is out.

4
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:35,767
PHIPPS: Yes, sir.

5
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:40,267
Any message for the Duke, sir?

6
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:41,967
No message for the Duke.

7
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:42,800
Very good, sir.

8
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:47,200
[telephone ringing]

9
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,933
Hello.

10
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:50,900
Yes.

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,400
What?

12
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:53,567
No, madam.

13
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,667
This is not the Royal
Cleaning Company.

14
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:57,167
This is the Royal Palace.

15
00:01:57,267 --> 00:01:59,167
You have the wrong number.

16
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:00,200
That's quite all right.

17
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:07,100
[clears throat]

18
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,100
His Majesty is out.

19
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,333
Yes, sir.

20
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:12,200
It's the Marquis of Birten, sir.

21
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh.

22
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,800
Send him in.

23
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:22,933
His Excellency, the
foreign minister.

24
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:23,833
Your Excellency.

25
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:25,433
Well, how'd do you do, Granton?

26
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:26,567
And where's His Majesty?

27
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,433
He went out, sir.

28
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:28,900
For a walk, I imagine.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,367
Hm.

30
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:32,333
And, uh, Her Majesty?

31
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:34,467
GRANTON: Finishing the
preparations for her trip.

32
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:37,467
The palace has been in quite
an uproar this morning.

33
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:39,333
No wonder the king
went out for a walk.

34
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:40,733
And what time does
the queen leave?

35
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,400
The procession leaves
the palace at 4:00 sharp.

36
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:44,167
The boat sails at 6:00.

37
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:45,667
Well, I must see
her before she goes.

38
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:48,333
I have some important
news for her.

39
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:51,767
I will tell Her
Majesty that you called.

40
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:53,433
I suppose the
king is quite upset

41
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:54,400
over the queen's departure.

42
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:56,633
Oh uh.

43
00:02:56,733 --> 00:02:57,933
Yes, sir.

44
00:02:58,033 --> 00:02:59,800
He feels very badly about it.

45
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,600
Oh, he does.

46
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,400
Does he?

47
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:05,567
[chuckling]

48
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:14,833
His Majesty is out.

49
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:16,567
Her Royal Highness,
Princess Anne.

50
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:17,333
Oh.

51
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:23,467
Alone?

52
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:24,600
GRANTON: Yes.
- Freddie.

53
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,567
Anne, darling.

54
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,367
Give me a cigarette quickly.

55
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:34,167
Oh what a nuisance mother is.

56
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:35,967
GRANTON: You know I feel
sorry for your mother.

57
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:37,900
She has to settle all
the affairs of the nation

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,300
before she leaves for America.

59
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,433
I know, but she doesn't have
to make such an infernal fuss

60
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:42,867
about everything.

61
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:45,933
She's furious now, because
father has gone out.

62
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:47,333
Mother tries to boss everything.

63
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:49,367
Well, she's not
going to boss me.

64
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:51,067
I'm not her husband.

65
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:53,133
I'm going to lead my own life.

66
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,567
And may I ask when
you intend to start?

67
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:58,300
As soon as she's safely
away on her trip to America.

68
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,100
One of these days mother
will pick up a New York paper

69
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,333
and discover her
daughter has eloped.

70
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:08,133
You are going to elope with
me, aren't you, Freddie?

71
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:09,567
Oh yes, Anne.

72
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:11,167
I wouldn't let you elope alone.

73
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:12,567
Oh.

74
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,633
You are sweet, Freddie.

75
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:16,800
You're giving up everything
for me, aren't you?

76
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,833
I giving up everything?

77
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:19,000
Well, I like that.

78
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,800
It's you who's giving
up everything for me.

79
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,000
You'll never be forgiven.

80
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,800
But I don't want
to be forgiven.

81
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,567
I only want to get away
from this stifling place.

82
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:31,400
I want to be happy and free.

83
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:34,633
You know, there's no one
here who will really miss

84
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,233
me for a minute when I'm gone.

85
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,867
Well, there's your father.

86
00:04:38,967 --> 00:04:40,433
Yes, there's father.

87
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:42,733
But father won't mind.

88
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:43,567
He'll understand.

89
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:45,167
He'd like to be free too.

90
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:46,100
If only he'd abdicate.

91
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,900
Oh, if he only would.

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,300
But he won't.

93
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,100
He wouldn't dare try anything
as strenuous as abdication.

94
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,567
Mother wouldn't let him.

95
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:54,733
You know how mother is.

96
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,433
Oh.

97
00:04:57,567 --> 00:05:00,133
I do.

98
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,567
Father thinks it's our duty
to keep the throne occupied.

99
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,567
Duty.

100
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:05,867
That's all I've been
allowed to think

101
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:08,567
about since the day I was born.

102
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,467
Well, I'm going to
think about myself,

103
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:12,867
my own happiness for a change.

104
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:14,933
I'm going away with you.

105
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:17,333
Oh, but when can
we start, Anne.

106
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:18,600
I'm trying hard to be patient.

107
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,567
But I... I can't
wait much stronger.

108
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:22,700
It's terrible having to wait.

109
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,900
Terrible for me
too, Freddie darling.

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,933
But we mustn't take any
chances until mother's

111
00:05:28,033 --> 00:05:29,800
safely across the Atlantic.

112
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,700
Well, I wish her bon voyage.

113
00:05:39,433 --> 00:05:41,233
Her Majesty the Queen.

114
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:54,300
Has His Majesty taken the
trouble to come here yet?

115
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,100
GRANTON: No, ma'am.

116
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,567
He hasn't.

117
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:58,433
Doesn't he realize that we're
to leave here in another hour?

118
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,233
Doesn't he know that he's put
on his [inaudible] uniform for

119
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,200
the procession to the harbor?

120
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,567
GRANTON: Yes, ma'am.

121
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:06,000
I am quite certain His Majesty
has been advised to that.

122
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,833
Then, why hasn't he come here?

123
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:09,167
Wouldn't you think
that he would know

124
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:11,667
that all this was terribly
worrying, terribly upsetting

125
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:13,067
for me.

126
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:14,833
Anne, your father is a very
inconsiderate, very thoughtless

127
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:15,667
man.

128
00:06:15,767 --> 00:06:17,333
Oh, don't be silly, mother.

129
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:19,300
Father probably thought
he'd just be in the way.

130
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,700
Well, he would have
been in the way.

131
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,033
But just the same,
he should have spoken

132
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,300
to me before he went out.

133
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,100
Uh, Lord Birten called, ma'am.

134
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,567
He asked to see you.

135
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:29,300
Suggested he had
good news for you

136
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,467
and said he'd come back later.

137
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:32,000
Then, I shall wait right here.

138
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:39,400
You two go and get ready
for the procession.

139
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:41,633
BOTH: Yes, ma'am.

140
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:42,833
Has General Northrup been here?

141
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:44,167
No, ma'am.

142
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:45,833
The Prime Minister hasn't
been to the palace all day.

143
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:47,567
I hope he doesn't come.

144
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,900
I hope I never see his
scowling face again.

145
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,467
Now, mother, you know you'd be
perfectly furious if he didn't

146
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:53,767
stop in to wish you goodbye.

147
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:56,033
I don't want any kind
wishes from General Northrup.

148
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:57,367
I don't like him.

149
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:59,200
He's no business to be prime
minister of this country.

150
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,567
Yes.

151
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,733
And if it weren't for General
Northrup and his army,

152
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:02,867
this country would
be a republic.

153
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:04,333
And where would you be then?

154
00:07:04,433 --> 00:07:06,167
I know where'd I be.

155
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:09,067
I'm happy to say there
is no danger of that.

156
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:12,400
Thank Heaven.

157
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:14,800
Thank Heaven we have the
confidence and loving

158
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,567
loyalty of our people.

159
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:18,667
The monarchy will never fall.

160
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:20,400
Oh, where is the king?

161
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:22,367
What on earth does he think
he's doing, wandering aimlessly

162
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:24,033
around when he's needed here?

163
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:25,067
Oh, forget it, mother.

164
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:26,333
There's plenty of time.

165
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:28,467
There'll never be plenty
of time for your father.

166
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:29,567
Probably, he'll need a shave.

167
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:31,800
And that always takes him hours.

168
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,800
Anne, some day you'll
be a queen, and then

169
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,567
you'll know what troubles I've
had, what sacrifices I've made.

170
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,167
Then, you'll know what
I've had to put up with.

171
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:43,300
Don't worry, mother.

172
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,767
You're going away on
a nice long vacation.

173
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:46,767
Vacation?

174
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,433
Do you think for
one moment that I'm

175
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:51,567
going to America for pleasure?

176
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:54,800
I'm going to work for the
good of my dear country.

177
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,900
I never do anything that isn't
for the good of my country.

178
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,033
Well?

179
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:05,667
Yes, ma'am.

180
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:09,600
General Northrup, together with
the Marquis of Birten, ma'am.

181
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,633
There you are.

182
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:11,867
Important business
to be attended to,

183
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:14,433
and the king is not here.

184
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:16,100
I will see them.

185
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,300
Yes, ma'am.

186
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,767
I'll speak to the
king about this.

187
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:20,567
With everything that
I have on my mind,

188
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,200
and he's dawdling
about in this manner.

189
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,333
Simply disgraceful.

190
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:27,567
His Supreme Excellency
the Prime Minister.

191
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:30,433
His Excellency the
Foreign Minister.

192
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:34,600
Your Majesty.

193
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,400
Your Majesty.

194
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:36,233
Your Royal Highness.

195
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,267
Your Royal Highness.

196
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:38,067
Gentlemen.

197
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:42,100
I've been given to
understand, ma'am,

198
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,867
that His Majesty is not here.

199
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:45,600
You've not been misinformed.

200
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,133
I have some matters of
vital importance to discuss.

201
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:49,233
Then, you may discuss them now.

202
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,567
We're leaving in a
short time, and we

203
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:52,067
cannot wait for the king.

204
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:53,833
I've had another
conference with the people's

205
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,767
leader, ma'am, Dr. Fellman.

206
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:58,100
You can't ask me to become
excited about that, general.

207
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,567
You're always
having conferences.

208
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:01,233
And if I weren't,
we'd find ourselves

209
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,867
involved in a revolution.
A revolution.

210
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:04,033
What nonsense.

211
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:06,233
Fellman wouldn't dare
try anything like that.

212
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,333
Ah, but Fellman isn't
the only one, ma'am.

213
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:10,200
There are others,
hundreds of thousands

214
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,767
of them, determined to
overthrow the monarchy.

215
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:15,567
Are you arresting any of
these violent minded men?

216
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:17,367
We're arresting
them by the hundreds.

217
00:09:17,467 --> 00:09:20,467
There can be but one
punishment for such traitors,

218
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:22,867
and that punishment is death.

219
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:23,833
Then why not execute them?

220
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:34,400
There's a reason
for that, ma'am.

221
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:38,400
You may or may not know that
our constitution provides...

222
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:39,867
You don't have to
tell me anything

223
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:41,633
about our constitution.

224
00:09:41,733 --> 00:09:43,667
My great grandfather wrote it.

225
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:44,467
Hm.

226
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:45,867
Go on.

227
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:47,767
Then, you are aware that no
political prisoner can be put

228
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:50,133
to death until his
sentence has been

229
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:51,233
counter-signed by the king.

230
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,633
Well?

231
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:55,267
There are over 50 such death
sentences in His Majesty's desk

232
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:58,800
at this very moment,
waiting to be signed.

233
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,867
They've been there
for over a week.

234
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,600
Is this true, Granton?

235
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,033
Why... why, yes, ma'am.

236
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:04,900
I tell you, ma'am.

237
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,867
The situation is intolerable.

238
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:10,133
These executions must
go through at once.

239
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:12,000
They shall go through.

240
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,500
His Majesty the King.

241
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,200
Good afternoon.

242
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:34,567
Where have you been?

243
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,667
I've been down to the
royal zoo, my dear.

244
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:42,067
I've been watching
the penguins walk.

245
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:43,200
I love to watch the penguins.

246
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,533
You know they walk
just like human beings.

247
00:10:45,633 --> 00:10:47,667
We've no time now
to discuss penguins.

248
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:48,533
Mhm.

249
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:49,800
What's the matter?

250
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,100
I've just heard
that you've neglected

251
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,300
to sign hundreds of
orders for the execution

252
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,933
of dangerous characters.

253
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:55,733
Who told you that?

254
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:56,900
I told her that, sir.

255
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,567
And I should be happy to
repeat my words to you.

256
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,300
You needn't bother.

257
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,300
I can't understand how you
could be so callous, how you

258
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,567
could neglect your duty in
such a slipshod irresponsible

259
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:06,967
manner.

260
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,200
Well, don't you realize that
these criminals will murder us

261
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,567
all if you give them a chance?

262
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,200
Can't you see that the
monarchy's in dreadful danger?

263
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,000
My dear, I know...

264
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:13,800
Her Majesty is right.

265
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,400
Naturally.

266
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:18,633
Now, just what am
I to do about it?

267
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:20,467
You're to sign those
orders of execution.

268
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:23,933
They've been accumulating
on your desk for weeks.

269
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:25,200
On my desk?

270
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,233
On my desk?

271
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,267
Why.

272
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:28,200
There must be
something wrong here.

273
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,400
Where could they be?

274
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:30,567
I never heard of anything
quite as ridiculous

275
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:34,200
as that in my life.

276
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,167
[roaring]

277
00:11:35,267 --> 00:11:35,967
Oh.

278
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,867
Granton, where are
those papers gone?

279
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:42,567
I'm afraid it's my fault, sir.

280
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:44,200
I took them down to
the Lord Chancellor's

281
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,633
office for verification.

282
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:47,567
Well, then, you go right down
to the Lord Chancellor's office

283
00:11:47,633 --> 00:11:48,600
and get them right back again.

284
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,400
- Yes, sir.
- There.

285
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:50,267
You see.

286
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:51,667
It wasn't my fault after all.

287
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:53,900
In my opinion, that man
should be instantly dismissed.

288
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,933
I should hope so.

289
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:56,400
He's a pest anyway.

290
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:57,633
I'll attend to him later.

291
00:11:57,733 --> 00:11:59,600
And the signed orders
will be in my hands today?

292
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,067
General, you may rest
assured that I shall

293
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,233
make every effort in my power.

294
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,433
QUEEN: They will.

295
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:04,633
I will see to that.

296
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:05,433
There.

297
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:06,567
You see.

298
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:08,233
You can put it right
out of your mind now.

299
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,367
I understand that Lord Birten
has something to say to us.

300
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:13,467
Well, we're all prepared
to hear from Lord Birten.

301
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,267
I think you'll be glad to
hear what I have to say, sir.

302
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:18,667
I am happy, I am proud
to say that I have

303
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:20,467
completed a little
arrangement on which

304
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:21,567
we've all set our hearts.

305
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:23,400
So what was that?

306
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:27,633
I received only an hour ago
telegraphic communication from

307
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:29,167
the foreign office in Grec.

308
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:29,967
Yes.

309
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:31,000
What is it?

310
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,100
I think that a
marriage can be arranged

311
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,200
between Prince William of Grec
and our own beloved Princess

312
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,300
Anne.

313
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,100
What?

314
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:40,933
Is it settled?

315
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:41,933
Practically.

316
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:43,433
And I may add that
this could never

317
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:44,600
have been accomplished
had it not

318
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,200
been for the tireless
efforts of Your Majesty.

319
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,333
QUEEN: My darling child,
you're engaged to be married.

320
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:53,167
Allow me to offer my
heartfelt congratulations,

321
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:54,400
Your Royal Highness.

322
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:56,600
Add my congratulations.

323
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,400
This will give us the prestige
we've so long deserved.

324
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:00,833
Congratulations for what?

325
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:03,433
It's a glorious triumph
for our diplomacy.

326
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:05,633
And you've made a
perfectly marvelous match.

327
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:07,000
I have made a match?

328
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,467
What have I had to do with it?

329
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:09,700
Have I been asked?

330
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,700
No one has even bothered
to consult me about this.

331
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,233
Well, I believe I can explain.

332
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,700
It was advisable to keep
this matter a profound secret

333
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,133
for diplomatic reasons.

334
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:19,900
Thus, we deemed it unwise
to divulge the terms,

335
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,033
even to Your Highness.

336
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,000
The terms.

337
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,233
Oh, so there were terms.

338
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,567
Oh yes.

339
00:13:24,633 --> 00:13:26,433
Your Majesty, the
marriage agreement

340
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:28,633
provides that the Princess
Anne will, of course, become.

341
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:30,933
Empress of Grec in due time.

342
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:33,867
Now, the eldest son will
become the heir to the throne.

343
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:35,000
The second son will become...

344
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,800
Two brothers?

345
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,167
My sons.

346
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:38,400
So the contract
provides that I shall

347
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,567
produce two male children.

348
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,933
Well, how do you know I can?

349
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:43,467
Anne, how shockingly
indelicate.

350
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:44,833
That's just what it is.

351
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:46,667
Indelicate, horrible, revolting.

352
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:47,967
Anne, come with
me this instant.

353
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:48,767
Come to your rooms.

354
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:49,567
Do you hear?

355
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,067
Father, you love me.

356
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:58,667
You understand me.

357
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:02,067
Can you let this
terrible thing happen?

358
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:03,633
Are you going to let
them do this to me?

359
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:07,633
It'll be all right, my darling.

360
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:08,833
You go to your room.

361
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:10,167
We'll talk about it later.

362
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:11,900
QUEEN: Come with me.

363
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,800
Go with your mother, Anne.

364
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,567
And don't cry anymore.

365
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,333
I'll have a little
talk with her.

366
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:27,767
Poor child.

367
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,400
She'll get over it when she
realizes what this means.

368
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:31,600
Just what does it mean?

369
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,067
This is beyond question
the greatest diplomatic

370
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:35,300
victory in the history of our...

371
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,233
Now, Northrup, let us not
go into all that again.

372
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,767
I know it is a glorious triumph.

373
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:41,900
You all deserve to be
very proud of yourself.

374
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,567
But I also know
that I do not care

375
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,767
to entrust my
daughter's happiness

376
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:45,900
to Prince William of Grec.

377
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,733
Now, look her, sir.

378
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:47,733
You're all wrong about this.

379
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,200
I can imagine no
light in which this

380
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,567
would appear other than
disagreeable and distasteful.

381
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:51,167
Your Majesty...

382
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:52,333
Your Majesty...

383
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,467
I do not care to hear
or speak of it again.

384
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:55,267
Your Majesty.

385
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,233
Well, king or no king, he
needn't think he can block

386
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,133
our plans for this wedding.

387
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:09,967
Don't worry.

388
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:11,200
It's all settled.

389
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,800
Here's the marriage
contract, signed and sealed.

390
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,567
They're as good as married now.

391
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
Ah, good.

392
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,400
Good.

393
00:15:23,033 --> 00:15:25,567
But I glad we'll be rid
of the queen for a time.

394
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,267
We'll be able to
get things done now.

395
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:28,767
Oh, she won't interfere
in this marriage.

396
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:30,567
She's as anxious for it
to go through as we are.

397
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,267
Yes.

398
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:32,067
I know.

399
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:33,367
But she's too officious.

400
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:34,933
The king, at least, knows
enough to keep his place.

401
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:37,133
But she's very
useful sometimes.

402
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:37,933
Yes.

403
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:39,100
As a press agent.

404
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:48,567
She'll make these
rich Americans pay

405
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,700
heavily for the privilege of
shaking hands with the royalty.

406
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,400
But here at home, we're
not dealing with Americans.

407
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:57,800
Dr. Fellman and revolutionists
are looking for trouble,

408
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,967
and I'm going to see
that they get it.

409
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,100
Phipps.

410
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,567
PHIPPS: Yes, sir.

411
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,400
What the deuce have you
done with that checkerboard?

412
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:13,567
Begging Your
Majesty's pardon, I

413
00:16:13,633 --> 00:16:18,433
placed it here for safekeeping.

414
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:20,367
Well, I wish you'd all
get together and come

415
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:22,000
to some definite
permanent hiding

416
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,333
place for this checkerboard.

417
00:16:23,433 --> 00:16:25,000
Yes, sir.

418
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,800
Perhaps, I should explain,
sir, that Her Majesty found the

419
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,633
old one and had it thrown out.

420
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:34,267
Well, there's one
satisfaction, Phipps.

421
00:16:34,367 --> 00:16:36,033
There's always plenty
more checkerboards.

422
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:36,833
Yes, sir.

423
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:37,933
Come on now.

424
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:39,300
I'm going to beat
the hide off you.

425
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,067
Oh, sir.

426
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,633
You know, Phipps.

427
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:45,200
You have an unfair
advantage over me.

428
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,467
An unfair advantage, sir.

429
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:49,600
Does Your Majesty imagine
that I should be guilty

430
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,767
of petty cheating in checkers?

431
00:16:51,867 --> 00:16:53,667
Don't be a fool, Phipps.

432
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:57,433
What I meant was is that you
get a chance to practice.

433
00:16:57,567 --> 00:17:00,100
Now, I'll wager that
when you're off duty,

434
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,233
you practice with the finest
checkers players in this city.

435
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,900
I never get any
chance to practice.

436
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,700
You're the only one around
the whole place who'll

437
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,900
ever play checkers with me.

438
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,200
You know, I thought
at time that I might

439
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,433
interest the queen in the game.

440
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:19,967
But she couldn't seem to
appreciate the charms.

441
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:21,967
Remarkable woman,
Her Majesty, Phipps.

442
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:23,267
A remarkable woman.

443
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:25,867
But she simply will
not play checkers.

444
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:27,100
Hm.

445
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:32,000
It would be Your Majesty's
first move this time.

446
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,433
Ah, so.

447
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:36,567
Well, there we are.

448
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,867
Beg pardon, sir.

449
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:42,433
But you've got the jump.

450
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:44,067
Oh, have I?

451
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:45,700
So you do practice.

452
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,600
Don't you, Phipps?

453
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,400
Hm.

454
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,367
Tell me.

455
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:49,167
Tell me, Phipps.

456
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:50,767
Have you any children?

457
00:17:50,867 --> 00:17:52,067
Six, sir.

458
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:53,567
All sons I presume.

459
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,333
No, sir.

460
00:17:54,433 --> 00:17:55,667
There's one daughter.

461
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:56,567
Married?

462
00:17:56,633 --> 00:17:57,333
Yes, sir.

463
00:17:57,433 --> 00:17:58,600
She is.

464
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,600
To a young man
of her own choice?

465
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,867
Yes, sir.

466
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:06,400
Unfortunately, she chose
the scientific farmer, sir.

467
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:09,733
And I may say it's been
a source of some regret

468
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,067
to me and to her mother.

469
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:14,433
You wanted her to
marry someone else.

470
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:15,800
Yes, sir.

471
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,800
We didn't consider him quite,
uh, eligible shall I say.

472
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,633
We'd hope the girl might
marry in her own class.

473
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:26,700
Is she happy?

474
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,133
Yes, sir.

475
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:32,067
I suppose she's happy and in a
rather rustic sort of way, sir.

476
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:32,867
[buzzing]

477
00:18:32,967 --> 00:18:34,367
Beg pardon, sir.

478
00:18:34,467 --> 00:18:35,967
That's the buzzer.
See who it is.

479
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:36,800
Will you, Phipps?

480
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,600
Yes, sir.

481
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,433
I want to talk to you, father.

482
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:42,933
Yes, my dear.

483
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:44,000
Alone.

484
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,567
You, uh, you may go, Phipps.

485
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:48,367
It will be my next move, sir.

486
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:59,967
I want you to tell
me something, father.

487
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:02,167
I want you to tell me the truth.

488
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,767
What is it, Anne?

489
00:19:03,867 --> 00:19:07,067
Did you know about this ghastly
thing they're trying to do.

490
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:08,633
Were you part of the conspiracy?

491
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:09,433
No.

492
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:11,567
I didn't know.

493
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:15,567
Oh, I'm glad, father.

494
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,233
Well, they're not going to make
a political bride out of me.

495
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,700
You know this man
you're supposed to marry.

496
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,367
Prince William.

497
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:23,567
No, but I've seen his picture
in the newspapers surrounded

498
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,267
by a lot of chorus girls.

499
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:27,867
Well, you shouldn't read
those kind of newspapers.

500
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:30,467
Everyone knows
what a rotter he is.

501
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:33,033
If I marry him, they'll
all be laughing at me,

502
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:34,100
or sympathizing with me.

503
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,667
It'll be just as bad either way.

504
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,467
I tell you, father,
I won't do it.

505
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,567
I won't do it.

506
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:40,567
I'll renounce my position.

507
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,367
I'll go into exile.

508
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:45,567
But I won't marry that foul man.

509
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:48,367
But my dear child, you
have to marry someone.

510
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:51,267
You must do your share toward
perpetuating the family.

511
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:54,167
The family can end here
and now for all I care.

512
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:57,600
If they must have two male
children, they can adopt them.

513
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,467
I'm sick of being royalty.

514
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:01,100
I want to be a person.

515
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,633
Well, being a member
of the royal family

516
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:04,433
has its advantages, Anne.

517
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:07,667
Think of all the orphan
asylums you can inspect.

518
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:09,900
Oh, don't joke
about it, father.

519
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,833
It's terribly serious to me.

520
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:15,267
Well, when we drive
through the streets now,

521
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:17,100
I look at the poor beggars.

522
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,167
I think to myself...

523
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:19,933
I know you think
yourself cheerfully,

524
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:24,100
gladly, would I change
places with even such as you.

525
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,400
I know.

526
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,633
I have read that
speech to myself

527
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:29,167
a thousand times in
the days of my youth.

528
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:31,467
And did it do me any good?

529
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:33,500
Have I ever become a person?

530
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,767
Have I ever found
that freedom that

531
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:38,233
is enjoyed by the celebrated
beggar in the gutter?

532
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,133
I'm afraid not, Anne.

533
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:42,967
I turned out to be a king.

534
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:46,800
And you intend to be just a
king all the rest of your life?

535
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,867
Well, I'm afraid I'll have
to stick to the job now,

536
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:51,733
even if there isn't
any future in it.

537
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,067
Well, never mind, father.

538
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:56,333
You're a good
king, a noble king.

539
00:20:56,433 --> 00:20:59,133
Well, I could be a bad
king for all the difference

540
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:00,333
it would make, Anne.

541
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:05,000
Take young Granton for instance.

542
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,433
He's a commoner by birth.

543
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:08,000
But he's a royalist at heart.

544
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,100
And I'm quite sure that if
we were languishing in exile,

545
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,167
you would find young
Granton perched on a soapbox

546
00:21:14,267 --> 00:21:17,300
in the park arguing
for the restoration,

547
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,900
and he'd go to his death
crying, "Long live the King."

548
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,300
Oh, no he wouldn't.

549
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,433
Granton would go into exile
with us and be glad to do it.

550
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:27,733
Well, how do you know that?

551
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:32,700
Well, I talk to him
now and then naturally.

552
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,133
Oh, I see.

553
00:21:35,233 --> 00:21:35,967
Ah, Granton.

554
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:37,033
We were just discussing you.

555
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:37,833
Me, sir?

556
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:39,167
Yes.

557
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:42,567
What would you say if I told
you I decided to abdicate?

558
00:21:42,633 --> 00:21:44,833
Would you tremble in
every fiber of your being.

559
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:47,433
Would you draw your
sword if you had one,

560
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:48,600
and would you cry, "No.
No."

561
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,733
No.
A thousand times no.

562
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,133
Over my dead body,
you leave the throne"?

563
00:21:52,233 --> 00:21:54,667
Or would you murmur
devoutly yourself,

564
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:58,800
"It's about time the old boy
got on to himself and retired."

565
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,167
I can only say,
sir, that I support.

566
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:03,067
Your Majesty in any venture
he might choose to undertake.

567
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:04,367
There.
Thank you, Granton.

568
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:05,167
Thank you.

569
00:22:05,267 --> 00:22:06,567
That's all I want to know.

570
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:08,567
May I make so
bold, sir, as to ask

571
00:22:08,633 --> 00:22:10,567
whether you have any such
revolutionary idea in mind?

572
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:12,267
You may make so bold.

573
00:22:12,367 --> 00:22:13,333
But my answer is no.

574
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,567
I haven't faintest
idea of abdicating.

575
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:17,000
Oh.

576
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,567
Here are the papers,
sir, for which you asked.

577
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:20,367
Papers?
Did I ask for papers?

578
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:21,567
Yes.

579
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:22,567
The orders for the
execution of the prisoners.

580
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,467
- Oh, you found them.
- Yes, sir.

581
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:24,833
They're ready for signatures.

582
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:26,333
Well, well, you take them
right out and lose them again.

583
00:22:26,433 --> 00:22:27,933
Yes, sir.
Will that be all, sir?

584
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:29,100
That'll be all.

585
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:35,567
How long has this
been going on?

586
00:22:35,633 --> 00:22:36,333
What?

587
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:38,733
This little romance.

588
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,033
How did you know?

589
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:41,300
The king knows everything.

590
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,900
You'd know that if you
paid strict attention

591
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,800
to your school books.

592
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,167
Oh, father.

593
00:22:45,267 --> 00:22:46,700
You've got to help us.

594
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,333
You're the only one
who can help us.

595
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:49,767
I know, but you
haven't told me how

596
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:51,567
long this has been going on.

597
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:52,967
For months.

598
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:53,767
We fell in love.

599
00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:54,900
We couldn't help it.

600
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,667
Well, that's a natural
impulse, I suppose.

601
00:22:56,767 --> 00:22:57,967
Have you made any
plans for the future?

602
00:22:58,067 --> 00:22:59,367
Yes.

603
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:01,000
We're going to elope as soon
as mother's landed in America.

604
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,867
We'll go to France.

605
00:23:01,967 --> 00:23:02,933
That's a free country, isn't it?

606
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:04,200
Reasonably so.

607
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,667
And after we get
there, we'll be married,

608
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:07,833
and Freddie will find
work of some kind.

609
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:11,233
He's always wanted to write,
or paint, or something.

610
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:12,600
I'm going to have
babies and be happy,

611
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,567
and you'll come to visit us.

612
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,467
And the third day of my
visit, Granton will say

613
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:17,867
is your father going
to stay here forever.

614
00:23:17,967 --> 00:23:18,700
Oh.

615
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,400
He won't say any such thing.

616
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:21,733
He loves you.

617
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,767
And besides, he's much too
sweet to be mean to anyone.

618
00:23:23,867 --> 00:23:25,367
Well, are you aware
of the character

619
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:26,433
of your fiance's family?

620
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:27,967
Of course, I am.

621
00:23:28,067 --> 00:23:30,133
Freddie's father is one of the
richest men in the kingdom.

622
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:31,367
I know.

623
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:32,733
Old Mr. Granton is one of
the pillars of the state

624
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,267
financially.

625
00:23:34,367 --> 00:23:35,567
But he is a plumber.

626
00:23:35,633 --> 00:23:37,167
A wholesale plumber.

627
00:23:37,267 --> 00:23:39,967
Nevertheless, he does mess
up with bathroom utensils.

628
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:41,767
Well, I don't care
what he is or isn't.

629
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:43,767
I love Freddie, and
nothing in Heaven or Earth

630
00:23:43,867 --> 00:23:45,767
is going to stop me
from marrying him.

631
00:23:45,867 --> 00:23:47,200
I'm afraid your
mother will not be

632
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,233
very enthusiastic about this.

633
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,167
[buzzing]

634
00:23:49,267 --> 00:23:51,400
I think I hear the buzzer.

635
00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:54,633
Her Majesty the Queen.

636
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,200
Do you happen to
realize what time it is?

637
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,200
My, my.
It is.

638
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,567
Isn't it?

639
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,833
There you two sit talking,
talking, talking of Heaven

640
00:24:01,933 --> 00:24:02,833
knows what.

641
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:04,633
And in half an
hour, I'm going away

642
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:07,567
across 3,000 miles
of ocean to America

643
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:09,467
into a strange
barbarous country.

644
00:24:09,567 --> 00:24:10,733
It isn't barbarous at all.

645
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:11,700
It is barbarous.

646
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,467
I've seen moving
pictures about it.

647
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:17,333
[gasp] Where did that
checkerboard come from?

648
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:19,667
General Northrup must
have left that here.

649
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:21,567
Are you going to change your
clothes for the procession?

650
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:22,367
Yes, I am.

651
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:23,767
It's the bazaar uniform.

652
00:24:23,867 --> 00:24:24,933
I believe it is.

653
00:24:25,033 --> 00:24:25,933
Bazaar uniform.

654
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:27,433
Then, why not do
something about it?

655
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:28,467
And you too.

656
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,933
The procession
starts at 4:00 sharp.

657
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:31,933
And I want you to
look very neat.

658
00:24:32,033 --> 00:24:33,800
There are to be over
30 photographers

659
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,100
between the palace and the dock.

660
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,633
I hope they don't
take any close-ups.

661
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:40,000
I look awful on the film.

[cheering]

664
00:25:49,467 --> 00:25:53,467
Lord Birten, while I'm away,
I want you to be very sure

665
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:56,133
that nothing happens
which might in any way

666
00:25:56,233 --> 00:25:58,800
jeopardize the coming
marriage of Princess Anne

667
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,400
to Prince William of Grec.

668
00:26:00,567 --> 00:26:02,367
You understand?

669
00:26:02,467 --> 00:26:03,667
Yes, Your Majesty.

670
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:06,567
In two months, Her Royal
Highness will have a birthday.

671
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,567
I've arranged a ball
for the occasion.

672
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,333
You will see that she
has an enjoyable evening.

673
00:26:11,433 --> 00:26:14,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

674
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,667
Anne, it's most unfortunate
that I have to go away

675
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:20,400
at this time, just when your
engagement to Prince William

676
00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:21,833
is to be announced.

677
00:26:21,933 --> 00:26:24,867
But the mission which takes me
away is a very important one.

678
00:26:24,967 --> 00:26:27,900
I am going to do my duty.

679
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,800
I want you both to bear
that in mind while I'm away.

680
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,667
Don't worry, mother.

681
00:26:31,767 --> 00:26:34,933
You can leave everything to us.

682
00:26:35,033 --> 00:26:37,800
We'll do our best in our
small way here at home.

[waltz music playing]

685
00:27:42,567 --> 00:27:45,900
I wonder what is
detaining His Majesty.

686
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Very likely, matters of
great political importance.

687
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,433
- I tell you Phipps, you did.
- Oh no, sir.

688
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:53,567
Now, listen.
Don't argue with me.

689
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,367
No, sir.
I'm very sorry.

690
00:27:54,467 --> 00:27:55,433
I'm not arguing with you, sir.

691
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:56,467
I don't care to argue.

692
00:27:56,567 --> 00:27:57,633
But begging your pardon.

693
00:27:57,733 --> 00:27:58,567
But know you're wrong.

694
00:27:58,667 --> 00:27:59,933
I don't care...

695
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:03,200
I'm very sorry to say, sir,
that Your Majesty has lost.

696
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,467
- I didn't lose...
- Excuse me, sir.

697
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:06,033
I've just come from the
extra session of Parliament.

698
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:06,900
Never mind, Parliament.

699
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,933
I want to go on with the game.

700
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:09,100
But sir, it's
desperately important.

701
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,633
Bugger Parlia... will
no one obey my commands?

702
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:11,800
Now, I want to talk
about it later.

703
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,667
Forgive me.
Please, sir.

704
00:28:12,767 --> 00:28:13,567
But their actions this evening...

705
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,333
It's a foregone conclusion.

706
00:28:14,433 --> 00:28:16,767
Your Majesty has lost.

707
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:17,767
I didn't lose.

708
00:28:17,867 --> 00:28:18,933
I... what?

709
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:21,767
Your Majesty, Her Royal
Highness, the Princess

710
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,667
Anne wishes me tell you that
the ball awaits your appearance,

711

sir.

712
00:28:25,633 --> 00:28:27,033
Oh.

713
00:28:27,133 --> 00:28:29,567
Thank you.

714
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,667
There you are.

715
00:28:30,767 --> 00:28:31,467
Thank you, sir.

[waltz music playing]

721
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:45,733
The time has come when we must
forcefully show our resentment

722
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:48,400
to Northrup's iron heel.

723
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:50,867
Tonight, he made
a violent speech,

724
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:55,500
and there was nothing for us to
do but to declare a revolution.

What is it?

Forgive me, sir.
I must speak.

733
00:30:29,467 --> 00:30:30,600
What's the matter, Freddie.

734
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,767
You look worried.
Well, is there anything wrong?

735
00:30:31,867 --> 00:30:32,867
You said something
upstairs about Parliament.

736
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:34,167
Yes, Parliament has
proclaimed Northrup

737
00:30:34,267 --> 00:30:36,067
dictator with absolute power.

738
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,467
Dr. Fellman got up and
spoke to the people

739
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:38,267
and said they
wouldn't stand for it.

740
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:39,467
Good for Fellman.

741
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:41,267
Well, Northrup then
replied that if the people

742
00:30:41,367 --> 00:30:42,700
were in for war, so was he.

743
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,400
He pounded the table with
his fist when he said it.

744
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,700
It's a crisis.

745
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,133
Now, Northrup's dictator,
with his guns and his army

746
00:30:47,233 --> 00:30:48,167
he'll butcher them.

747
00:30:48,267 --> 00:30:49,600
You run right over
to the War Office.

748
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,167
See what their latest plans are.
And hurry back.

749
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:52,267
All right, sir.

750
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:53,767
Father, you realize
this is our chance.

751
00:30:53,867 --> 00:30:55,033
Who's chance?

752
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:56,267
Mine and Freddie's.

753
00:30:56,367 --> 00:30:58,200
This revolution will give
us a chance to get away.

754
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,333
Oh, we can't talk
about that now.

755
00:30:59,433 --> 00:31:00,667
There's enough
disturbance as it is.

756
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:02,467
Freddie and I would have
eloped long ago if we could.

757
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:03,600
Mother had me too
closely watched.

758
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,900
But tonight, tonight,
they will have

759
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,133
forgotten to worry about me.

760
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:07,633
They have enough to worry
about, and so have I.

761
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:08,933
But this is our last chance.

762
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:09,967
I am to be married next week.

763
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:11,567
If I don't go away
now, I never will.

764
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,067
This is no time
to talk about love.

765
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:14,467
I don't care what's happening.

766
00:31:14,567 --> 00:31:15,900
The Army and Navy can
shoot their heads off

767
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,300
if they want to.

768
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,633
I'm going, to be married, to
be free, and you won't stop me.

769
00:31:20,733 --> 00:31:22,400
You wouldn't dare.

770
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:24,933
At times, you remind
me of your mother.

Why.

777
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,067
They're on the cathedral.

Your Majesty, General
Northrup called us, sir.

783
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,967
All officers are to report to
their commands immediately.

784
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:45,567
My men will escort
the ladies to safety.

785
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,167
Very well then.

with the firing line?

No, sir.

793
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,133
He's at the War Office.

794
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:02,433
That is undoubtedly the
safest place in the city.

795
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:03,233
Come.

I'm sorry to
disturb Your Majesty.

But we're taking measures
to defend the palace.

There might be
unexpected developments.

Well, go ahead and take them.

806

You won't disturb me at all.

But I want to watch.

815
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,167
Anne, dear, you
mustn't stay there.

816
00:33:04,267 --> 00:33:05,333
Why not?

817
00:33:05,433 --> 00:33:06,400
And what are those things?

818
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,800
Sandbags, sir.

819
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,833
They make rather good protection
against stray bullets, sir.

820
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:10,700
Who ordered them?

821
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,100
General Northrup, sir.

822
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,567
Well, it's very
charming of Northrup

823
00:33:13,633 --> 00:33:15,667
to be so concerned
for my safety,

824
00:33:15,767 --> 00:33:17,000
but you take them
right out of here.

825
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,467
I don't want my apartment
all messed up with sandbags.

826
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:20,433
Yes, sir.

827
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:21,567
Out with those
sandbags, you men.

828
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:22,367
On the double.

829
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:32,833
Thank you very
much, Major Blent.

830
00:33:32,933 --> 00:33:33,833
Not at all, sir.

831
00:33:33,933 --> 00:33:34,900
Everything shall
be as you say, sir.

832
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,067
Who told you that?

833
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:38,233
It goes without saying, sir.

834
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:39,333
Thank you.

835
00:33:39,433 --> 00:33:40,400
It's very nice to have
you around, major.

836
00:33:40,567 --> 00:33:41,567
Thank you, sir.

837
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:43,133
And may I got now, sir?

838
00:33:43,233 --> 00:33:43,933
You may go now.

839
00:33:44,033 --> 00:33:45,367
Excellent.

840
00:33:45,467 --> 00:33:48,867
You know I have half a mind to
give that fellow another medal.

841
00:33:48,967 --> 00:33:50,033
Is the yacht at Stannidge?

842
00:33:50,133 --> 00:33:51,300
- Yes, sir.
- The road open?

843
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,267
Oh yes.

844
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:53,300
About a two hours
drive, isn't it?

845
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,433
Father, are we running away?

846
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:55,567
No.

847
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,000
But you are, and
Granton's going with you.

848
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,667
- But I can't do that, sir.
- Well, you wanted to escape.

849
00:33:58,767 --> 00:33:59,567
Here's your chance.

850
00:33:59,633 --> 00:34:00,900
But how are we going to do it?

851
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,133
The yacht is
anchored at Stannidge.

852
00:34:02,233 --> 00:34:03,233
I'll give orders for
her to sail tonight

853
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:04,400
for Sherberg with you on board.

854
00:34:04,567 --> 00:34:05,233
Now, go upstairs.

855
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:06,667
Pack your things.

856
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:08,300
Change your clothes, and don't
forget to take your toothbrush.

857
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,600
Oh, Father.

858
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,700
At last, at last, I'm getting
away from this prison.

859
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,633
I'm through will be royalty.

860
00:34:12,733 --> 00:34:14,000
I'm going to live.

861
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,900
But Your Majesty, we
can't leave now with all...

862
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,733
Oh, don't argue
with him, Freddie.

863
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:17,800
We're going.
We're going.

864
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,600
Yes.

865
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,633
And you'd better hurry.

866
00:34:19,733 --> 00:34:20,833
I'll hurry all right.

867
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,400
Oh, thank you, my darling.

868
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:23,833
Thank you.

869
00:34:23,933 --> 00:34:25,567
You'll never be sorry
you've done this for me.

870
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:26,967
I'll be so happy.

871
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:29,567
And you'll be happy
too, won't you?

872
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,600
I expect so.

873
00:34:33,967 --> 00:34:35,300
If I could only see
mother's expression

874
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,167
when she hears about this.

875
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,000
Sir, I thank you too.

876
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,467
But I can't accept this
gracious offer, sir.

877
00:34:43,567 --> 00:34:45,300
Really.
Well, why not?

878
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,400
I couldn't leave you with all
this danger threatening, sir.

879
00:34:47,567 --> 00:34:48,567
Oh, don't be silly.

880
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:50,033
I have a whole army
and navy to protect me.

881
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:51,067
I don't need you.

882
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:52,633
So what is it
you want me to do?

883
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:54,567
You're to marry my daughter.

884
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:56,567
You're to write, or
paint, or something,

885
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,433
and you're to have babies.

886
00:34:57,567 --> 00:34:59,333
I forget what it all is about.

887
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:02,100
General Northrup
to see Your Majesty.

888
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,167
There.

889
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,900
You see, the palace
is perfectly safe.

890
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,467
Even Northrup's
willing to come here.

891
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:07,700
Do you want to see him, sir?

892
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,200
I do not.
You see him.

893
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,300
Find out what he wants.

894
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,600
And I'll get the orders
off to Stannidge.

895
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,400
All right.

896
00:35:14,967 --> 00:35:16,200
Show him in, Phipps.

897
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,333
PHIPPS: Very good, sir.

898
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,933
Here's um...

899
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:26,400
His Supreme Excellency
the Prime Minister.

900
00:35:26,567 --> 00:35:27,867
Where's the king?

901
00:35:27,967 --> 00:35:29,100
He's gone to his room.

902
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,467
I have a communication
from Dr. Fellman.

903
00:35:30,567 --> 00:35:32,467
I thought he might care to see.

904
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:33,567
Well, I can take
it to him, sir.

905
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:35,367
Oh, never mind.
Doesn't matter anyway.

906
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,200
I suppose His Majesty
doesn't care to be annoyed

907
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,233
with business matters just now.

908
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:39,033
Here.

909
00:35:39,133 --> 00:35:40,100
Give that to the king.

910
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,967
I beg your pardon,
General Northrup.

911
00:35:42,067 --> 00:35:43,167
Those are His Majesty's cigars.

912
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:45,067
I know it.

913
00:35:45,167 --> 00:35:47,167
Get me the Admiralty Office.

914
00:35:47,267 --> 00:35:48,267
I gave you an
order, Mr. Granton.

915
00:35:48,367 --> 00:35:50,567
Do you intend to obey it?

916
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,833
Or must I entrust it to a
more dependable servant?

917
00:35:54,933 --> 00:35:57,700
[laughing]

918
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,967
Who's laughing at whom?

919
00:36:00,067 --> 00:36:02,300
I want to talk to Lord Ennol.

920
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,767
This is General Northrup.

921
00:36:03,867 --> 00:36:05,900
Yes.

922
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,267
Are the rest of the ships
ready to go into action?

923
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:09,567
Good.

924
00:36:09,633 --> 00:36:12,633
That'll be all.

925
00:36:12,733 --> 00:36:14,333
Well?

926
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:17,267
Lord Birten to see His Majesty.

927
00:36:17,367 --> 00:36:18,600
Send him in.

928
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,233
I'll see him.

929
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:21,033
Very well.

930
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:29,433
Lord Birten.

931
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,900
Northrup, you... you seem
to be in full possession.

932
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,767
Yes.

933
00:36:36,867 --> 00:36:38,000
The king has gone to his room.

934
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,367
He's hiding under
the bed I suppose.

935
00:36:40,467 --> 00:36:43,300
[laughs] Well, it's
the best place for him.

936
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,300
How goes the battle?

937
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,767
Oh, don't call
that farce a battle.

938
00:36:47,867 --> 00:36:49,567
Well, I hope you get
it over with soon.

939
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:51,333
That noise is simply terrific.

940
00:36:51,433 --> 00:36:52,833
[boom]

941
00:36:54,433 --> 00:36:56,467
I know I shan't be able
to sleep a wink tonight.

942
00:36:56,567 --> 00:36:59,033
Well, we won't quit until
we've made a clean job of it.

943
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,400
Well, you had
better hurry it up.

944
00:37:00,567 --> 00:37:02,567
Prince William of Grec arrives
for the wedding next week.

945
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:05,400
I am told that he is a
very nervous young man.

946
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:06,233
[laughing]

947
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:07,733
Ah, good evening gentlemen.

948
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:09,467
BOTH: Your Majesty.

949
00:37:09,567 --> 00:37:10,400
Ah, Northrup.

950
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:12,167
Have a cigar.

951
00:37:12,267 --> 00:37:13,467
Oh, you had one.

952
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:14,800
Did you get my note, sir?

953
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,800
Yes, I did.

954
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,467
I've had the
Admiralty on the wire.

955
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:20,033
The rest of the ships are
ready to start shelling.

956
00:37:20,133 --> 00:37:21,133
Well, you can't do that.

957
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:22,433
You'll kill thousands
of men and women.

958
00:37:22,567 --> 00:37:24,100
Well, I've given
them fair warning.

959
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,567
I've issued an
ultimatum giving them

960
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,233
a half hour in which to lay
down their arms and surrender.

961
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:28,667
And what was their
answer to that?

962
00:37:28,767 --> 00:37:30,767
They said they'd never give in
until I was ready to arbitrate.

963
00:37:30,867 --> 00:37:31,800
Well, then, why not arbitrate?

964
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,067
I arbitrate to that rabble?

965
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:37,033
Well, I appreciate the delicacy
of your feelings, Northrup,

966
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:39,267
but the naval guns will
not go into action.

967
00:37:39,367 --> 00:37:41,600
I regret to say, sir, that
I must be allowed to handle

968
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,133
this crisis as I see fit.

969
00:37:44,233 --> 00:37:47,733
I merely told you of my plans
just as a matter of courtesy.

970
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,233
I am overwhelmed
with gratitude.

971
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,800
Sometimes, frankness pays.

972
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,900
And I'm here to tell you
that I am running this show,

973
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,700
and I intend to run
it in my own way.

974
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,700
You're quite right.

975
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,933
Frankness does pay sometimes.

976
00:38:00,033 --> 00:38:02,400
So I'd like to ask you
what are your intentions.

977
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:04,367
Are you going to
set up a republic?

978
00:38:04,467 --> 00:38:07,133
You've already bullied your
way into the dictatorship,

979
00:38:07,233 --> 00:38:08,967
thereby making me more
of a cypher than ever.

980
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:11,300
Your next step is
evidently the presidency.

981
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,633
When are you going
to take that step.

982
00:38:12,733 --> 00:38:14,300
I resent that insinuation.

983
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,633
I resent it bitterly.

984
00:38:15,733 --> 00:38:17,300
That was not an insinuation.

985
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,933
That was a frank
statement of fact.

986
00:38:19,033 --> 00:38:20,900
Well, whatever it
was, I resent it.

987
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,867

988

[glass breaking]

989
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,233
What was that?

[booming]

991
00:38:28,267 --> 00:38:29,567
It's the stupid
field artillery.

992
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,133
They're shooting the wrong way.

993
00:38:31,233 --> 00:38:32,700
Something gone wrong
with your plans, general?

994
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,967
I asked them to put a
stop to this nonsense.

995
00:38:36,067 --> 00:38:38,400
I think they're aiming at us.

996
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:39,767
I'll break a few
colonels for this.

997
00:38:39,867 --> 00:38:40,800
Certainly.
Here.

998
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,767
Don't forget your Sunday hat.

999
00:38:41,867 --> 00:38:42,733
Oh!

1000
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:44,333

[boom]

1002
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:48,733
I think I better go
to the foreign office.

1003
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:53,000
You take my advice
and try the cellar.

1004
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:53,967
[boom]

1005
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:57,333
You mustn't stay here, sir.

1006
00:38:57,433 --> 00:38:58,467
It's very dangerous.

1007
00:38:58,567 --> 00:38:59,600
Blent, you've assured
me of your loyalty.

1008
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,033
I think I can depend on you.
Always, sir.

1009
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:02,567
I want to get the
Princess Anne out of this.

1010
00:39:02,633 --> 00:39:03,567
A yacht is at Stannidge.

1011
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:04,733
Granton will take her there.

1012
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:06,467
You escort them both as
far as the harbor to see

1013
00:39:06,567 --> 00:39:07,867
that they get away safely.

1014
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:09,133
Now, get a car, a good one.

1015
00:39:09,233 --> 00:39:10,567
Have it at the Quince
Street entrance right away.

1016
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:11,333
And hurry.

1017
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:12,200
Yes, sir.

1018
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,000
[boom]

1019
00:39:14,233 --> 00:39:15,467
The car will be ready
in a few minutes.

1020
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:17,100
You must go once.
But what were those explosions?

1021
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,733
Shells, my dear, the
fact of the matter

1022
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:21,567
is the revolution has stole
General Northrup's artillery

1023
00:39:21,633 --> 00:39:22,733
when he wasn't looking.

1024
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:24,067
And they're trying
to shell the palace.

1025
00:39:24,167 --> 00:39:24,967
It seems that way.

1026
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,567
What are you doing?

1027
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:33,100
You think I'd go now?

1028
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,467
But my dear child, you must go.

1029
00:39:34,567 --> 00:39:36,900
This is your one chance,
you can't lose it.

1030
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,967
It's too late now, father.

1031
00:39:39,067 --> 00:39:41,967
I'm going to stay here,
because I love you.

1032
00:39:42,067 --> 00:39:44,800
And because we must be
together when they come.

1033
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,567
Good for you, Anne.

1034
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:49,333
Well, there's nothing left
for me to do except burst

1035
00:39:49,433 --> 00:39:50,567
into tears I suppose.

1036
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:52,033
[boom]

1037
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:04,233
That one seems to have
landed in the queen's room.

1038
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,633
I wish Phipps were here.

1039
00:40:08,733 --> 00:40:09,600
What do you want of Phipps?

1040
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,233
Anything you want, I'll do it.

1041
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:12,467
Go down to the
cellar right away

1042
00:40:12,567 --> 00:40:14,200
and get about a dozen
bottles of champagne.

1043
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,367
It seems to me the time has come
to all get gloriously drunk.

1044
00:40:16,467 --> 00:40:17,833
Oh, father, that's
a marvelous idea.

1045
00:40:17,933 --> 00:40:18,700
I think so.

1046
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,767
BLENT: Your Majesty.
- What?

1047
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:20,833
BLENT: Dr. Fellman is here.
- Fellman?

1048
00:40:20,933 --> 00:40:22,367
- Fellman?
- He wants to see you.

1049
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:23,433
He insists that he must.

1050
00:40:23,533 --> 00:40:24,900
Oh, father, don't see him.
He might...

1051
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,967
Nonsense.
Show him in.

1052
00:40:26,067 --> 00:40:26,700
You go get that champagne.
Look, sir.

1053
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,800
I've got to say here...

1054
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,600
Do what I tell you.

1055
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,400
Get the champagne.

1056
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,333
Get lots of it.

1057
00:40:30,433 --> 00:40:31,467
You never can tell.

1058
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:32,767
This fellow Fellman
might want a drink too.

1059
00:40:32,867 --> 00:40:33,967
Go on.
[boom]

1060
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:36,133
Come in, Dr. Fellman.

1061
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:43,233
Thank you, sir, for having
the courage to see me.

1062
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:45,100
I hope you'll pardon the
appearance of this room.

1063
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,500
It's a bit upset at the moment.

1064
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,500
Is the bodyguard
absolutely necessary?

1065
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,900
I am unarmed.

1066
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,900
You may go, Blent.

1067
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,633
Well, tell me, doctor, to what
am I indebted for this visit,

1068
00:40:55,733 --> 00:40:56,800
et cetera, et cetera?

1069
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,933
A great many lives are
being lost tonight, sir.

1070
00:40:59,033 --> 00:41:00,933
Unnecessarily lost.

1071
00:41:01,033 --> 00:41:04,000
Otherwise, I should not have
risked my own to come here.

1072
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,567
I commend your courage, doctor.

1073
00:41:05,633 --> 00:41:07,433
But tell me, why are
your people trying

1074
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:08,867
to batter down the palace?

1075
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,767
You know they might want to use
it for a museum or something.

1076
00:41:10,867 --> 00:41:14,267
You, sir, have never come
into contact with reality.

1077
00:41:14,367 --> 00:41:17,400
You have lived your
quiet detached life here.

1078
00:41:17,567 --> 00:41:19,467
No one has ever
told you the truth.

1079
00:41:19,567 --> 00:41:21,633
No one ever takes the
trouble to tell me anything.

1080
00:41:21,733 --> 00:41:23,167
I understand.

1081
00:41:23,267 --> 00:41:25,033
But you are the
ruler of this nation.

1082
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:26,600
That's where you make
a great mistake, doctor.

1083
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,567
I am not the ruler.

1084
00:41:27,633 --> 00:41:28,933
I am merely the king.

1085
00:41:29,033 --> 00:41:32,200
And are you satisfied, sir,
that you have been a good king?

1086
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,567
Well, I've always been on
time at all official functions.

1087
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:38,267
My public speeches have been
brief and of good taste.

1088
00:41:38,367 --> 00:41:40,867
I've always appeared
presentable on rest parade.

1089
00:41:40,967 --> 00:41:42,967
My home life is above reproach.

1090
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:46,400
I don't know what else I could
have done to, uh, fulfill

1091
00:41:46,567 --> 00:41:48,133
my obligations to my people.

1092
00:41:48,233 --> 00:41:52,267
You could have prevented them
from being driven to despair.

1093
00:41:52,367 --> 00:41:53,667
I could have done that?

1094
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:57,033
You have an exaggerated idea
of my importance, doctor.

1095
00:41:57,133 --> 00:41:58,233
Well, the people have the vote.

1096
00:41:58,333 --> 00:41:59,467
Why don't they use it?

1097
00:41:59,567 --> 00:42:01,167
Why don't they throw
Northrup out and put you in?

1098
00:42:01,267 --> 00:42:02,700
The issue is up to you, sir.

1099
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,933
It is not up to me.

1100
00:42:04,033 --> 00:42:06,400
I have no right to meddle
in the state's business.

1101
00:42:06,567 --> 00:42:07,900
I'm merely a figurehead,
and a none too

1102
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,167
ornamental one at that.

1103
00:42:09,267 --> 00:42:11,633
Then, sir, on
behalf of the people,

1104
00:42:11,733 --> 00:42:13,567
I must demand your abdication.

Put me through to the Admiralty.

Hello.

1113
00:42:27,367 --> 00:42:30,000
I... I want to speak
to Lord Ennol please.

1114
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,933
This is the king.

1115
00:42:33,033 --> 00:42:36,400
The king.

1116
00:42:36,567 --> 00:42:39,833
This is the king speaking.

1117
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:41,800
What?

1118
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:47,700
It's spelled K-I-N-G. King.

1119
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,667
Thank you so much.

00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,667
Hello, Ennol.

1122
00:42:53,767 --> 00:42:57,100
Ennol, those guns
must be stopped.

1123
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,567
I don't care who
ordered you to fire.

1124
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:04,567
I want [inaudible] the entire
fleet on my authority at once.

1125
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,000
Thank you.

1126
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,467
Now, that might be
known in history

1127
00:43:07,567 --> 00:43:10,667
as the final act of King
Eric VIII, the last of a long

1128
00:43:10,767 --> 00:43:11,933
of line of non-entities.

[gunfire]

1130
00:43:15,933 --> 00:43:17,167
Now, it's up to your
people cease firing

1131
00:43:17,267 --> 00:43:18,267
and declare an armistice.

1132
00:43:18,367 --> 00:43:20,267
But an armistice
will do no good.

1133
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:22,567
This country must have
a permanent peace.

00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,767
I warn you, sir.

1135
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:26,667
If you wish to save your
country, you must abdicate,

1136
00:43:26,767 --> 00:43:28,067
and you must do it at once.

1137
00:43:28,167 --> 00:43:29,567
There's nothing to be done now
except that your people must

1138
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:30,733
surrender.

1139
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:32,700
And trust ourselves to
the mercy of Northrop.

1140
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,567
He'll overrule you again.

1141
00:43:33,633 --> 00:43:34,367
Oh no, he won't.

1142
00:43:34,467 --> 00:43:35,567
I give you my word that he...

1143
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:38,800
You must take my word for it.

1144
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,667
I accept your word, sir.

1145
00:43:40,767 --> 00:43:41,467
You do.

1146
00:43:41,567 --> 00:43:42,333
Thank you, doctor.

1147
00:43:42,433 --> 00:43:43,567
You're a very unusual fellow.

1148
00:43:51,767 --> 00:43:54,100
Your Majesty, General
Northrup is on his way up.

1149
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,267
He is, huh.

1150
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:58,167
Well, Dr. Fellman, I don't
know how you got here.

1151
00:43:58,267 --> 00:43:59,767
But you must go away
as soon as possible.

1152
00:43:59,867 --> 00:44:01,967
Here, Blent, take Dr.
Fellman through my apartments

1153
00:44:02,067 --> 00:44:03,133
and escort him as
far as necessary.

1154
00:44:06,933 --> 00:44:08,300
[shouting]

1155
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,800
[booming]

1156
00:44:10,867 --> 00:44:11,800
Goodbye, doctor.

1157
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,200
Now, we must keep
this conversation

1158
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,700
secret, especially from our
mutual friend who's on the up.

1159
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,900
NORTHRUP: [shouting]

1160
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,367
Blent, take him that way.

1161
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,067
NORTHRUP: Out of my way!

1162
00:44:24,167 --> 00:44:25,167
What's the matter, general?

1163
00:44:25,267 --> 00:44:26,567
Something gone wrong
with your artillery?

1164
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:28,567
Did you give that order of
the naval guns to cease firing?

1165
00:44:28,633 --> 00:44:29,867
I did.

1166
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,267
Well, I've come here to tell
you that's the last order

1167
00:44:31,367 --> 00:44:32,300
you'll give out.

1168
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,667
You don't have to
remind me of that.

1169
00:44:33,767 --> 00:44:36,200
Oddly enough, I commented on
that very fact at the time.

1170
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,333
I want you to understand
that I am in charge here.

1171
00:44:38,433 --> 00:44:40,067
And I won't have
any interference

1172
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:41,367
from you or anyone else.

1173
00:44:41,467 --> 00:44:43,233
Do you realize that you're
talking to your king?

1174
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:44,067
Bah.

1175
00:44:44,167 --> 00:44:46,100
We're talking as man to man.

1176
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,567
I won't stand for you
meddling in my affairs.

1177
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,133
Get me the Admiralty Office.

1178
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:52,567
The battleship
will resume firing.

1179
00:44:52,667 --> 00:44:54,133
The battleships will
not resume firing.

1180
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,467
I warned you not to
interfere with me.

1181
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,300
I gave those orders to the
Navy, and the orders stand.

1182
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,633
I'm the one to give
orders to the Navy.

1183
00:44:58,733 --> 00:45:01,567
I am the dictator by
act of Parliament.

1184
00:45:01,633 --> 00:45:02,700
I am the king by
the grace of God.

1185
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,667
Ah.

1186
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:05,300
Don't use that
catchphrase on me.

1187
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,600
You'll be king only as
long as I and my army

1188
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:10,000
are on hand to keep
you on the throne.

1189
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,233
Now, look here, Northrup.

1190
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,767
I'm getting awfully fed
up with you and your army.

1191
00:45:12,867 --> 00:45:14,400
I'm fed with up
your bombasting and

1192
00:45:14,567 --> 00:45:15,967
your flag-waving patriotism.

1193
00:45:16,067 --> 00:45:17,567
And in fact, I'm
getting awfully fed

1194
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,567
up on your personal appearance.

1195
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:20,167
[blustering] Your Majesty!

1196
00:45:20,267 --> 00:45:22,233
Don't Majesty me.

1197
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:23,867
As you said before, we
were talking man to man.

1198
00:45:23,967 --> 00:45:25,333
Now, I'm going to
take this opportunity

1199
00:45:25,433 --> 00:45:27,100
to remind you of something.

1200
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,367
I hope the revolution wins.
Ah.

1201
00:45:28,467 --> 00:45:29,800
You're a contemptible traitor.

1202
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,067
Possibly I am.

1203
00:45:31,167 --> 00:45:32,900
Possibly I've been
a traitor all along.

1204
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,767
But if my throne depends
on you and your army,

1205
00:45:34,867 --> 00:45:36,733
I don't want to sit on the
rotten thing any longer.

1206
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:38,167
[phone ringing]

1207
00:45:38,267 --> 00:45:39,567
Hello.

1208
00:45:39,633 --> 00:45:40,467
It's the War Office for you.

1209
00:45:40,567 --> 00:45:41,267
Oh.

1210
00:45:41,367 --> 00:45:42,467
Thank you.

1211
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:43,733
Hello.
Yes.

1212
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:44,567
What?

1213
00:45:44,633 --> 00:45:46,333
[laughing]

1214
00:45:46,433 --> 00:45:47,167
Oh, the coward.

1215
00:45:47,267 --> 00:45:48,100
Yes.
Good.

1216
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,567
I'll be right over.

1217
00:45:49,633 --> 00:45:50,667
Well, they've surrendered.

1218
00:45:50,767 --> 00:45:51,933
Who has?

1219
00:45:52,033 --> 00:45:54,033
Fellman and Laker on the
condition that we arbitrate.

1220
00:45:54,133 --> 00:45:55,467
Well, of course,
you'll arbitrate.

1221
00:45:55,567 --> 00:45:56,700
Oh yes.

1222
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,967
We'll arbitrate right
enough with machine guns.

1223
00:45:58,067 --> 00:45:58,933
This matter will be settled
without machine guns.

1224
00:45:59,033 --> 00:46:00,167
- And by whom?
- By me.

1225
00:46:00,267 --> 00:46:01,100
[laughs]

1226
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,300
By you.

1227
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,400
I don't need you and your army.

1228
00:46:03,567 --> 00:46:05,000
I don't need your
hand-picked Parliament.

1229
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,467
I have another power on my side.

1230
00:46:06,567 --> 00:46:07,567
And what power may I ask?

1231
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:08,367
The people.

1232
00:46:08,467 --> 00:46:09,367
[laughs]

1233
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:11,467
Use the people.

1234
00:46:11,567 --> 00:46:13,033
Use the people for
all they're worth.

1235
00:46:13,133 --> 00:46:16,000
But first, be sure
they are on your side.

1236
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:19,467
[laughing]

1237
00:46:23,033 --> 00:46:23,933
What's he bellowing about?

1238
00:46:24,033 --> 00:46:25,133
He was just putting
me in my place.

1239
00:46:25,233 --> 00:46:26,233
Well, don't worry about him.

1240
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:27,633
What you need is some champagne.

1241
00:46:27,733 --> 00:46:28,567
I know, my dear.

1242
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,567
But the revolution is over.

1243
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:32,600
Then, we have
nothing to celebrate.

1244
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,900
You know, sir.

1245
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,333
That fellow Northrup is becoming
absolutely insufferable.

1246
00:46:35,433 --> 00:46:37,633
He came in here this morning and
acted as if he owned the place.

1247
00:46:37,733 --> 00:46:40,567
I know, but I
talked back to him.

1248
00:46:40,633 --> 00:46:42,933
[shouting]

1249
00:46:49,367 --> 00:46:50,767
[gunshot]

1250
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:55,000
Was that a cork?

1251
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:55,967
It sounded like a shot, sir.

1252
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,100
Yes.

1253
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,700
Someone just made an attempt
on General Northrup's life.

1254
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,633
But the bullet only
grazed his cheek, sir.

1255
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:19,000
The crowd outside are in a
terrible state of excitement.

1256
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:19,967
[boom]

1257
00:47:27,033 --> 00:47:29,033
Well, perhaps, if I
appear on the balcony,

1258
00:47:29,133 --> 00:47:29,867
I can reassure them.

1259
00:47:29,967 --> 00:47:31,033
Oh, I wouldn't do that, sir.

1260
00:47:31,133 --> 00:47:32,400
The temper of that mob
is violently hostile.

1261
00:47:32,567 --> 00:47:33,600
Father, I wouldn't
go out there.

1262
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:34,633
They might try to
assassinate you, darling.

1263
00:47:34,733 --> 00:47:35,767
Don't worry, Anne.

1264
00:47:35,867 --> 00:47:37,800
If they couldn't hit
Northrup at close range,

1265
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,767
they won't harm me.

1266
00:47:40,867 --> 00:47:45,200
[shouting]

1267
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,667
MOB: The King!

1268
00:47:54,767 --> 00:47:57,633
The King!

1269
00:47:57,733 --> 00:48:01,100
Long live the King!

1270
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,100
Long live the King!

1271
00:48:19,567 --> 00:48:21,100
It's up to me to outline
your duties for you.

1272
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,367
Do I have to think
of everything?

1273
00:48:22,467 --> 00:48:23,800
Do I?
Answer me that.

1274
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,900
Will the king so much as lift
his little finger to help me.

1275
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,867
Now, see.

1276
00:48:26,967 --> 00:48:28,000
Will my daughter
take the slightest

1277
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,567
interest in her own wedding?
She will not.

1278
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,800
Oh no.

1279
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:31,833
All the work, all the
responsibility is left to me.

1280
00:48:31,933 --> 00:48:33,400
If I weren't here
to toil and slave,

1281
00:48:33,567 --> 00:48:34,967
there wouldn't be any wedding.

1282
00:48:35,067 --> 00:48:38,033
His Majesty the King.

1283
00:48:43,933 --> 00:48:44,933
Where have you been?

1284
00:48:45,033 --> 00:48:46,467
Now, Martha, don't scold me.

1285
00:48:46,567 --> 00:48:48,333
I've just been getting all
dressed for the wedding.

1286
00:48:48,433 --> 00:48:50,967
Come here, and
let me look at you.

1287
00:48:51,067 --> 00:48:52,567
Where is the Order
of St. Christopher?

1288
00:48:52,633 --> 00:48:54,600
Well, to tell you the truth,
I didn't have room for it.

1289
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:55,733
Well, find room.

1290
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:56,967
I've had trouble enough
getting this palace

1291
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:58,433
patched up without
having to worry

1292
00:48:58,567 --> 00:49:00,667
about your personal appearance.

1293
00:49:00,767 --> 00:49:01,733
Where are you going?

1294
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:02,900
I was just going to
put that order on.

1295
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,300
I want you to go
up and talk to Anne.

1296
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,633
But I haven't anything
particular to say to her.

1297
00:49:05,733 --> 00:49:07,467
I don't know what's happened
to Anne while I was away.

1298
00:49:07,567 --> 00:49:09,700
This absurd revolution seems
to have gone to her head.

1299
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,233
If there were to be an
outburst of temperament

1300
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:12,833
during the ceremony,
well, you know

1301
00:49:12,933 --> 00:49:14,133
what Prince William is like.

1302
00:49:14,233 --> 00:49:16,100
He'd... he'd pack up and go
home without another word.

1303
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,267
Well, you wouldn't
call that a tragedy.

1304
00:49:18,367 --> 00:49:19,300
It would be a disaster.

1305
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,567
I want you to
explain this to Anne.

1306
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:21,867
She pays more attention to you.

1307
00:49:21,967 --> 00:49:23,867
Heaven knows why.

1308
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:26,967
You must talk to
her, and be firm.

1309
00:49:27,067 --> 00:49:27,767
Yes, my dear.

1310
00:49:27,867 --> 00:49:28,567
I will.

1311
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:36,733
PHIPPS: His Majesty the King.

1312
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,100
Come in, father.

1313
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,300
Well, what is it, father?

1314
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,867
Sit down, Anne.

1315
00:49:49,967 --> 00:49:51,733
Anne, I'm going to be
very firm with you.

1316
00:49:51,833 --> 00:49:55,533
And if you find me being
otherwise, you must remind me.

1317
00:49:55,633 --> 00:49:59,600
Well, what is it that mother
has told you to tell me now?

1318
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,300
Anne, I'm to give you
this bit of advice.

1319
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,633
When the archbishop says to
you, "Do you take this man"

1320
00:50:04,733 --> 00:50:06,167
to be your lawful husband?"

1321
00:50:06,267 --> 00:50:08,967
You are to respond, "I do."

1322
00:50:09,067 --> 00:50:12,933
You are not to tell him
where you think he should go.

1323
00:50:13,033 --> 00:50:15,500
Suppose I feel like
saying just that.

1324
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:19,233
You are to have absolutely
no feelings at all today.

1325
00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:21,467
If any apropos
remarks occur to you,

1326
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,800
you are to direct
them to your husband.

1327
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,000
I'll kill myself first.

1328
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,567
That's another thing that you
positively must not do today.

1329
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:32,200
Father, can you stand
by and joke about it?

1330
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,700
I gave you your chance
during the revolution.

1331
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,000
You wouldn't take it.

1332
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:36,867
I couldn't take it.

1333
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:38,367
I couldn't.

1334
00:50:38,467 --> 00:50:40,667
Can't you understand that?

1335
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:43,000
You did the right
thing then, Anne.

1336
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:47,033
And I was glad and I
was sorry that you did.

1337
00:50:47,133 --> 00:50:49,933
But you bare the curse
of royalty, Anne.

1338
00:50:50,033 --> 00:50:52,333
You will always do the
right thing, even when

1339
00:50:52,433 --> 00:50:54,467
you know it's the wrong thing.

1340
00:50:54,567 --> 00:50:56,433
I wished they'd have stood
us up before a firing squad

1341
00:50:56,567 --> 00:50:58,300
that night.

1342
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:04,600
Prince William of Grec
to see Her Royal Highness.

1343
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,600
Shall we see him?

1344
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:06,467
Yes.

1345
00:51:06,567 --> 00:51:07,900
Perhaps he's changed his mind.

1346
00:51:11,167 --> 00:51:11,867
Pst.

1347
00:51:11,967 --> 00:51:12,667
Phipps.

1348
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:15,800
Send him in.

1349
00:51:22,767 --> 00:51:26,767
His Imperial Highness
Prince William of Grec.

1350
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:38,400
Ah, how are you, William?

1351
00:51:38,567 --> 00:51:39,933
That is, I should say Willy.

1352
00:51:40,033 --> 00:51:41,400
Your Majesty.

1353
00:51:41,567 --> 00:51:43,800
Your Royal Highness.

1354
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,433
We're surprised to see you.

1355
00:51:45,567 --> 00:51:47,600
Pleasantly surprised
I might add.

1356
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,067
I came here expressly
to see the bride.

1357
00:51:50,167 --> 00:51:51,333
To tell truth, sir.

1358
00:51:51,433 --> 00:51:53,033
I had hoped I might
see her alone.

1359
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,867
You have something of an
intimately personal nature

1360
00:51:59,967 --> 00:52:01,400
to discuss, I take it.

1361
00:52:01,567 --> 00:52:02,867
Exactly.

1362
00:52:02,967 --> 00:52:07,000
Well, that being the case,
I shall take this opportunity

1363
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,633
to take a ride on my bicycle.

1364
00:52:22,933 --> 00:52:24,700
Shall we both sit down?

1365
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,600
No.

1366
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,400
You appear to have
something on your mind.

1367
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,200
I have.

1368
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,067
It's killing me.

1369
00:52:31,167 --> 00:52:33,067
I would like to have it there.

1370
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:35,233
You're worried
about our marriage?

1371
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:36,733
I am.

1372
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:39,667
I thought so.

1373
00:52:39,767 --> 00:52:43,900
I may as well begin by
telling you, I don't like you.

1374
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,567
I don't like you a bit.

1375
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,167
And you'd like to be released?

1376
00:52:49,267 --> 00:52:50,733
I most certainly would.

1377
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:52,000
Then, I release you.

1378
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,933
I wouldn't think of holding
you against your will.

1379
00:52:54,033 --> 00:52:55,567
Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

1380
00:52:55,667 --> 00:52:57,600
I merely said I should
like to be released.

1381
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,767
It doesn't mean that I'm
asking to be released.

1382
00:53:00,867 --> 00:53:03,467
Then, what do you want?

1383
00:53:03,567 --> 00:53:05,900
I merely want to talk to you.

1384
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,800
I'm anxious to say a few things
while our relationship is still

1385
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,567
on a fairly friendly basis.

1386
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:18,833
After all, I shall have to live
with you for fully two weeks.

1387
00:53:18,933 --> 00:53:20,033
The thought is revolting to you.

1388
00:53:20,133 --> 00:53:21,900
It's none too palatable to me.

1389
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,300
The fact remains, we
are about to be married.

1390
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,433
Why not make the most of it?

1391
00:53:25,567 --> 00:53:26,900
Go ahead and make
the most of it

1392
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,633
if you like, but don't expect
any hearty cooperation from me.

1393
00:53:29,733 --> 00:53:31,000
Look here, Anne.

1394
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,567
I'm perfectly willing to swallow
my prejudices against you

1395
00:53:33,633 --> 00:53:35,467
and pretend to be
highly romantic.

1396
00:53:35,567 --> 00:53:36,300
Why not respond?

1397
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,400
Oh, so that's it.

1398
00:53:37,567 --> 00:53:38,900
You want me to make love to you.

1399
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:39,700
Oh, I beg your pardon.

1400
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,633
Freddie.

1401
00:53:40,733 --> 00:53:41,700
Why, Anne.
What's the matter?

1402
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,567
If you don't mind.

1403
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,300
This is the man I love.

1404
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,400
The man I'll always love.

1405
00:53:45,567 --> 00:53:46,933
Why, Anne.

1406
00:53:47,033 --> 00:53:49,567
I've misjudged you grossly.

1407
00:53:49,633 --> 00:53:51,700
Granton, my apologies.

1408
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,833
I've been making indecent
proposals to your fiance.

1409
00:53:53,933 --> 00:53:54,633
She's not my fiance.

1410
00:53:54,733 --> 00:53:55,767
She's yours.

1411
00:53:55,867 --> 00:53:56,633
And I love her.

1412
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:57,667
And I love you.

1413
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:59,100
I can't pretend to
love anyone else.

1414
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,567
It does make it a bit awkward.

1415
00:54:00,633 --> 00:54:01,633
Doesn't it?

1416
00:54:01,733 --> 00:54:02,700
I know it does, and
I'm terribly sorry.

1417
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,167
Not for you, but for her.

1418
00:54:06,967 --> 00:54:08,933
Well, is everything settled?

1419
00:54:09,033 --> 00:54:09,733
Yes.

1420
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:12,300
Everything's settled.

1421
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,700
Then, the wedding is
not to be cancelled?

1422
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,833
Oh no, Your Majesty.

1423
00:54:15,933 --> 00:54:17,600
We're more desperately
in love than ever.

1424
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,200
How perfectly charming.

1425
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,433
Well, I really
must be moving on.

1426
00:54:21,567 --> 00:54:24,000
However, we will meet
again at the altar.

1427
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:27,100
With the wedding bells ringing
merrily and the organ booming

1428
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,400
forth its impressive message...

1429
00:54:28,567 --> 00:54:29,467
Oh, shut up.

1430
00:54:29,567 --> 00:54:30,267
Goodbye.

1431
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,233
Good day, young man.

1432
00:54:34,333 --> 00:54:36,200
My congratulations.

1433
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,000
Good day, sir.

1434
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,300
Good afternoon, Willy.

1435
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:46,800
What a curious young man.

1436
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:47,600
He's loathsome.

1437
00:54:50,967 --> 00:54:53,067
It's my duty to tell you,
sir, that I must resign

1438
00:54:53,167 --> 00:54:54,600
from Your Majesty's service.

1439
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,733
Oh, you're going away
to forget, I suppose.

1440
00:54:56,833 --> 00:54:57,967
Yes, sir.

1441
00:54:58,067 --> 00:54:59,200
Oh, father, I can't
let Freddie go.

1442
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,633
I'd much rather kill myself.

1443
00:55:01,733 --> 00:55:02,900
Well, you may have
that done for you.

1444
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:03,933
- What do you mean?
- What?

1445
00:55:04,033 --> 00:55:05,300
Well, I have an
appointment here

1446
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,667
with Dr. Fellman and Mr. Laker,
his friend, very shortly.

1447
00:55:07,767 --> 00:55:10,567
And if we don't pacify
Laker before the wedding

1448
00:55:10,633 --> 00:55:13,200
there will be bomb,
bullet, and so forth.

1449
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,867
Well then, sir, we better
notify General Northrup

1450
00:55:14,967 --> 00:55:15,800
and the police.
No.

1451
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:16,967
No.
This is my private secret.

1452
00:55:17,067 --> 00:55:18,567
I'm not sharing it, even
with General Northrup.

1453
00:55:18,633 --> 00:55:19,833
But sir, no member
of the royal family

1454
00:55:19,933 --> 00:55:21,033
ought to venture
out into that mob.

1455
00:55:21,133 --> 00:55:22,267
Let them have their
ceremony here.

1456
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,567
No.

1457
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,100
The ceremony will be at
the cathedral as planned.

1458
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,867
We mustn't disappoint
the archbishop.

1459
00:55:26,967 --> 00:55:28,700
Why he has an elaborate
candle display

1460
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,767
all ready for the occasion.

1461
00:55:29,867 --> 00:55:31,367
Father, have pity on me.

1462
00:55:31,467 --> 00:55:32,733
I'm desperate.

1463
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:35,967
I have nothing but unspeakable
horror to look forward to.

1464
00:55:36,067 --> 00:55:37,667
Let them throw their bombs.

1465
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:39,200
Don't try to talk
them out of it.

1466
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,433
I'm not going to.

1467
00:55:40,567 --> 00:55:43,567
I'm going to introduce
them both to your mother.

1468
00:55:43,633 --> 00:55:44,333
Her Maje...

1469
00:55:44,433 --> 00:55:45,633
Oh, get away.

1470
00:55:48,967 --> 00:55:49,967
Here, Granton.

1471
00:55:50,067 --> 00:55:51,467
I want you to give
this to the archbishop.

1472
00:55:51,567 --> 00:55:53,567
It's the prayer he's to
deliver at the conclusion

1473
00:55:53,633 --> 00:55:54,300
of the ceremony.

1474
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,567
Yes, ma'am.

1475
00:55:56,667 --> 00:55:58,100
Something you composed
yourself, my dear.

1476
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,233
Yes.

1477
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:00,300
I wouldn't leave it
to that old numbskull.

1478
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,167
He'd say just the
wrong thing, and it

1479
00:56:01,267 --> 00:56:02,033
would get into the newspapers.

1480
00:56:02,133 --> 00:56:03,833
I have to think of everything.

1481
00:56:03,933 --> 00:56:06,900
Anne, don't you realize that
you're to be ready to leave

1482
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,300
the palace in 20 minutes?

1483
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,467
Yes, mother.

1484
00:56:09,567 --> 00:56:11,433
I've memorized the whole
list of instructions.

1485
00:56:11,567 --> 00:56:13,567
I'll start.

1486
00:56:13,667 --> 00:56:15,467
What on Earth's
the matter with her?

1487
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:25,100
Well, she just had an
interview with Prince Willy,

1488
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,000
and she's not feeling
quite herself.

1489
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:28,967
Poor Anne.

1490
00:56:29,067 --> 00:56:30,133
Poor Anne indeed.

1491
00:56:30,233 --> 00:56:31,733
That rebellious
young lady doesn't

1492
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:33,867
know when she's in love.

1493
00:56:33,967 --> 00:56:35,933
Do you remember the
day of our wedding?

1494
00:56:36,033 --> 00:56:38,033
I do.

1495
00:56:38,133 --> 00:56:40,200
What were your emotions then?

1496
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,100
How did you feel?

1497
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,567
What... what were
you thinking of?

1498
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,367
I know what I was thinking of.

1499
00:56:45,467 --> 00:56:47,967
I was grimly determined
to do my duty.

1500
00:56:48,067 --> 00:56:50,600
And you did.

1501
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,767
But didn't you feel a spark
of rebelliousness, Martha?

1502
00:56:53,867 --> 00:56:55,967
Wasn't there a small but
persistent voice within you

1503
00:56:56,067 --> 00:56:58,233
that kept saying, "Run away now."

1504
00:56:58,333 --> 00:56:59,933
Run away before it's too late.

1505
00:57:00,033 --> 00:57:01,400
Save your one chance of love.

1506
00:57:01,567 --> 00:57:03,167
"Save your happiness."

1507
00:57:03,267 --> 00:57:05,300
Didn't you have to fight
hard to suppress it?

1508
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,400
I did suppress it.

1509
00:57:06,567 --> 00:57:07,833
My strength is greater
than my weakness.

1510
00:57:07,933 --> 00:57:08,933
I didn't run away.

1511
00:57:09,033 --> 00:57:10,000
I went to the cathedral.

1512
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:11,567
I faced you at the altar.

1513
00:57:11,667 --> 00:57:13,433
And when we stepped
out on the balcony

1514
00:57:13,567 --> 00:57:16,033
to be cheered by the crowds,
I smiled on them to let

1515
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:17,667
them know that I was happy.

1516
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:20,433
Have you forgotten
that I smiled?

1517
00:57:20,567 --> 00:57:21,200
No.

1518
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,400
I haven't forgotten.

1519
00:57:23,567 --> 00:57:26,467
I haven't forgotten
that smile, Martha.

1520
00:57:26,567 --> 00:57:29,400
It was a gruesome smile.

1521
00:57:29,567 --> 00:57:32,933
And when I saw it, I wanted
to say to you, "Go away now."

1522
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:34,900
Go to the man you love.

1523
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Go before it's too late.

1524
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,733
"Don't... don't ruin
your life for me."

1525
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:39,833
I didn't ruin my life.

1526
00:57:39,933 --> 00:57:40,800
I've made a success of it.

1527
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,433
I've served my country well.

1528
00:57:42,567 --> 00:57:44,567
And I want my daughter to
be worthy of the honorable

1529
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,567
tradition which she inherits.

1530
00:57:47,633 --> 00:57:48,333
Poor Anne.

1531
00:57:48,433 --> 00:57:50,700
She'll be a rotten queen.

1532
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:55,200
General Northrup and Lord
Birten to see Your Majesties.

1533
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:56,333
Oh, Great Scott.

1534
00:57:56,433 --> 00:57:57,700
I don't want to
see him right now.

1535
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,933
Why not?

1536
00:57:59,033 --> 00:58:01,333
Well, to tell you the
truth, Northrup and I are

1537
00:58:01,433 --> 00:58:02,633
not exactly on speaking terms.

1538
00:58:02,733 --> 00:58:04,000
What nonsense.

1539
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:07,000
You need pay no attention
to that blowhard Northrup.

1540
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:10,300
Phipps, show Birten and
Northrup to the counsel chamber.

1541
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,800
I'll settle him.

1542
00:58:14,567 --> 00:58:15,267
Come.

1543
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,800
Your Majesties.

1544
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,033
Your Majesty, I've
just been informed

1545
00:58:36,133 --> 00:58:38,267
by the Grecian ambassador
of a conspiracy

1546
00:58:38,367 --> 00:58:39,567
to prevent the wedding.

1547
00:58:39,667 --> 00:58:41,067
And that the Princess Anne
is planning an elopement.

1548
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:41,900
An elopement?

1549
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:42,700
With whom?

1550
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,933
With Frederick Granton.

1551
00:58:44,033 --> 00:58:45,833
Yes, with that snippy
young secretary of yours.

1552
00:58:45,933 --> 00:58:47,067
Who told you that?

1553
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:49,167
Why, Prince William
himself, Your Majesty.

1554
00:58:49,267 --> 00:58:51,800
And the princess told him that
she was in love with Granton.

1555
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:54,133
And her actions confirmed it.

1556
00:58:54,233 --> 00:58:55,967
Yes, I've had Granton arrested.

1557
00:58:56,067 --> 00:58:57,167
He's in the palace
guard house now.

1558
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:58,667
Well, what do you propose
to do with Granton?

1559
00:58:58,767 --> 00:59:00,300
Oh, Your Majesty, I have
a suggestion to offer.

1560
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,400
There's a tramp steamer
sailing within the hour for the

1561
00:59:02,567 --> 00:59:04,400
eastern coast of South America.

1562
00:59:04,567 --> 00:59:06,233
Why not place Granton
aboard that boat?

1563
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:07,033
No.

1564
00:59:07,133 --> 00:59:08,333
It's safer to shoot him.

1565
00:59:08,433 --> 00:59:09,433
General Northrup is right.

1566
00:59:09,567 --> 00:59:10,567
Oh, the scoundrel.

1567
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,467
I could kill him myself.
No.

1568
00:59:11,567 --> 00:59:12,567
No.

1569
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,133
I... I think an execution
would be messy.

1570
00:59:14,233 --> 00:59:15,000
It would cause talk.

1571
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:15,800
I favor Birten's plan.

1572
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,333
It's much more sensible.

1573
00:59:17,433 --> 00:59:19,667
But no one need know that
he'd been put to death.

1574
00:59:19,767 --> 00:59:21,767
Oh, but Your
Majesty, his father

1575
00:59:21,867 --> 00:59:23,067
might become inquisitive.

1576
00:59:23,167 --> 00:59:24,600
Who cares what
his father thinks?

1577
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:25,833
He's a plumber.

1578
00:59:25,933 --> 00:59:27,567
Ah, but he's a
wholesale plumber.

1579
00:59:27,633 --> 00:59:30,167
And don't forget Northrup,
Mr. Granton Senior contributes

1580
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:31,600
to your campaign fund.

1581
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:32,733
Oh, well.

1582
00:59:32,833 --> 00:59:33,767
Well, we'll put him
aboard the ship then.

1583
00:59:33,867 --> 00:59:35,800
This is a crowning outrage.

1584
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,300
To think that this has been
going on in this very palace,

1585
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,267
and that I shouldn't have
known anything about it.

1586
00:59:40,367 --> 00:59:41,800
It does seem
incomprehensible, doesn't it?

1587
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:44,567
Phipps, send me Blent
right away please.

1588
00:59:44,633 --> 00:59:45,433
Yes, Your Majesty.

1589
00:59:48,433 --> 00:59:51,600
Who started this
miserable, sordid affair?

1590
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,067
It wasn't an affair.

1591
00:59:53,167 --> 00:59:54,500
It was a romance.

1592
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,200
Northrup, will you countersign
that to make it entirely legal.

1593
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:57,000
Please.

1594
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:58,300
Oh, Blent.

1595
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,933
I've just written an order
of exile for Mr. Granton.

1596
01:00:00,033 --> 01:00:01,133
You're to execute that order.

1597
01:00:01,233 --> 01:00:02,967
You're to take him in a
closed car to the harbor

1598
01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:05,200
and put him on board, uh...
What's the name of that boat.

1599
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,433
Oh, the steamship Caleo, sir.

1600
01:00:07,533 --> 01:00:08,400
Captain Whitley commanding.

1601
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,300
Friend of yours?

1602
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,300
BRETIN: Oh yes, sir.

1603
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,000
You give this order
to the captain.

1604
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,067
Signed by me, countersigned
by General Northrup.

1605
01:00:14,167 --> 01:00:15,300
It contains full instructions.

1606
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,800
And see that the prisoner
isn't put aboard until

1607
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,400
the last moment before sailing.

1608
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,867
And I suggest, major, that you
remain with him until the ship

1609
01:00:20,967 --> 01:00:22,533
is well out of the harbor.

1610
01:00:22,633 --> 01:00:23,800
He might be a good swimmer.

1611
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:24,600
Well, sir.

1612
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:25,967
We got that in time.

1613
01:00:26,067 --> 01:00:26,900
Oh.

1614
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,233
The blow would have finished me.

1615
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:33,267
Dr. Fellman is here
accompanied by...

1616
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:34,067
Fellman?

1617
01:00:34,167 --> 01:00:35,067
Fellman?

1618
01:00:35,167 --> 01:00:37,000
What does he want?

1619
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:40,933
He says he has an
appointment with His Majesty.

1620
01:00:41,033 --> 01:00:42,300
He is accompanied by...

1621
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,933
This can't be true.

1622
01:00:44,033 --> 01:00:45,267
What does this mean?

1623
01:00:45,367 --> 01:00:48,033
It means that Dr. Fellman
has an appointment with me.

1624
01:00:48,133 --> 01:00:49,367
Is Dr. Fellman alone?

1625
01:00:49,467 --> 01:00:50,367
No, sir.

1626
01:00:50,567 --> 01:00:52,367
He is not alone.

1627
01:00:52,467 --> 01:00:56,300
As I've been attempting to
explain, sir, for some time,

1628
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,567
he is accompanied by Mr. Laker.

1629
01:01:00,633 --> 01:01:01,300
Laker!

1630
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,167
Why that dirty...

1631
01:01:02,267 --> 01:01:03,567
I won't have him in the palace.

1632
01:01:03,633 --> 01:01:04,700
But he's already in.

1633
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,000
- Then, have him put out at once.
- No.

1634
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:06,900
We can't do that.

1635
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,300
We must speak to
him very kindly.

1636
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,967
If not, he's liable to upset
all our plans for the wedding.

1637
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:12,467
What could they do to
prevent the wedding?

1638
01:01:12,567 --> 01:01:15,000
Well, they could assassinate
Prince Willy, thereby

1639
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:16,767
removing the bridegroom.

1640
01:01:16,867 --> 01:01:17,967
Very well.

1641
01:01:18,067 --> 01:01:20,267
I consent to see them.

1642
01:01:20,367 --> 01:01:21,400
Under protest.

1643
01:01:21,567 --> 01:01:22,900
Yes, but you better
let me do the talking.

1644
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,133
Thank you, General Northtrup.

1645
01:01:24,233 --> 01:01:27,567
I think you can leave the
situation in my hands.

1646
01:01:27,667 --> 01:01:29,900
Bring them in, Phipps.

1647
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,867
Yes, Your Majesty.

1648
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,433
Dr. Fellman and Mr. Laker.

1649
01:01:51,567 --> 01:01:54,167
Gentleman, permit me to
present Her Majesty the Queen.

1650
01:01:54,267 --> 01:01:54,967
Your Majesty.

1651
01:01:55,067 --> 01:01:56,333
Your Majesty.

1652
01:01:56,433 --> 01:01:58,267
General Northrup, Marquis of
Birten, of course, you know.

1653
01:01:58,367 --> 01:01:59,567
Now, that's all settled.

1654
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,133
I'll hear what you have
to say, because none of us

1655
01:02:01,233 --> 01:02:02,600
is to be late to the wedding.

1656
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,333
Your Majesty
knows the situation

1657
01:02:04,433 --> 01:02:06,433
so far as we are concerned.

1658
01:02:06,567 --> 01:02:08,100
You have been warned.

1659
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,567
Thoroughly warned.

1660
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,100
Your Majesty, a week ago, after
an extremely violent battle

1661
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,867
the revolutionist
announced that they were

1662
01:02:13,967 --> 01:02:15,200
willing to lay down their arms.

1663
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:18,700
Our surrender constituted
an acceptance of our terms.

1664
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,033
What were those terms?

1665
01:02:20,133 --> 01:02:21,333
That the chief cause of all
trouble, the unemployment

1666
01:02:21,433 --> 01:02:22,933
situation, be relieved.

1667
01:02:23,033 --> 01:02:25,433
You, General Northrup, have
refused even to consider

1668
01:02:25,567 --> 01:02:26,300
a council for arbitration.

1669
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,467
Quite right too.

1670
01:02:27,567 --> 01:02:28,767
I can do nothing about
unemployment until we

1671
01:02:28,867 --> 01:02:29,700
have the money available.

1672
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,100
May I ask, sir.

1673
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,267
What is being done with the
loan of $100 millions of dollars

1674
01:02:33,367 --> 01:02:34,567
recently negotiated in America?

1675
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:35,300
Ah.

1676
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:36,600
I knew it.

1677
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,567
You're trying to rob our
country of the money I earned.

1678
01:02:38,633 --> 01:02:40,067
The people must
pay the interest.

1679
01:02:40,167 --> 01:02:42,467
Some day they must
pay the principle.

1680
01:02:42,567 --> 01:02:44,400
They have a right
to their share.

1681
01:02:44,567 --> 01:02:45,367
Is that unreasonable?

1682
01:02:45,467 --> 01:02:46,400
I tried to tell you.

1683
01:02:46,567 --> 01:02:48,267
Is that unreasonable,
Your Majesty?

1684
01:02:48,367 --> 01:02:49,600
I beg your pardon.

1685
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:50,567
I wasn't listening.

1686
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:52,200
I told you so, Fellman.

1687
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:54,567
We wasted our time coming
here to talk to these tyrants.

1688
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,567
Your Majesty, I have tried
to bring this business

1689
01:02:57,667 --> 01:02:59,233
to a sensible conclusion.

1690
01:02:59,333 --> 01:03:01,400
I am afraid it cannot be done.

1691
01:03:01,567 --> 01:03:03,867
I don't care to be
dictated to by you people.

1692
01:03:03,967 --> 01:03:06,633
I shall arbitrate when I
am entirely ready to do so.

1693
01:03:06,733 --> 01:03:08,867
And on my own terms, not yours.

1694
01:03:08,967 --> 01:03:11,700
LAKER: Very well, we'll
show you our strength today?

1695
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,333
But every royal
family in Europe

1696
01:03:13,433 --> 01:03:14,467
is represented here today.

1697
01:03:14,567 --> 01:03:16,200
The Emperor and Empress
of Grec are here.

1698
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,367
They'll have to
take their chances

1699
01:03:17,467 --> 01:03:19,033
along with the rest of you.

1700
01:03:19,133 --> 01:03:21,400
And if any of you reach
the cathedral alive

1701
01:03:21,567 --> 01:03:24,567
it will be due to an
oversight [inaudible].

1702
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:25,733
NORTHRUP: All right.

1703
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:27,200
We'll settle this matter
once and for all today.

1704
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:29,200
It shall be a
fight to the death.

1705
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:30,200
To the death.

1706
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:32,300
And the blood guilt
will be yours.

1707
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,200
I accept it with thanks.

1708
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:35,100
Come on, Fellman.

1709
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,100
We've talked enough.

1710
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,567
Now, just one minute.

1711
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,300
Now, Northrup I'm quite sure
that you'd be willing to take

1712
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,667
the blame for my death.

1713
01:03:40,767 --> 01:03:43,067
But I couldn't allow you to
assume that responsibility.

1714
01:03:43,167 --> 01:03:45,933
I have here a very
interesting volume.

1715
01:03:46,033 --> 01:03:46,933
A very rare one.

1716
01:03:47,033 --> 01:03:48,233
The constitution of our country.

1717
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:49,567
I took it out of the
library last night

1718
01:03:49,633 --> 01:03:51,300
and read it cover to cover.

1719
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,967
And really, it is surprisingly
interesting reading.

1720
01:03:54,067 --> 01:03:56,267
I must ask Your
Majesty to excuse me.

1721
01:03:56,367 --> 01:03:57,700
I have much to attend to.

1722
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,400
Now, Laker, you attend
to me just a minute.

1723
01:03:59,567 --> 01:04:00,567
I won't take much of your time.

1724
01:04:00,667 --> 01:04:03,100
As I said, I read the
constitution last night,

1725
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,967
and I was deeply impressed
with the passages

1726
01:04:05,067 --> 01:04:06,567
that describe the
duties, functions,

1727
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,433
and powers of the king.

1728
01:04:08,567 --> 01:04:10,633
General Northrup,
it is my command

1729
01:04:10,733 --> 01:04:11,667
that Parliament be dissolved.

1730
01:04:11,767 --> 01:04:12,467
What?

1731
01:04:12,567 --> 01:04:13,767
Parliament is dissolved.

1732
01:04:13,867 --> 01:04:14,767
Have you gone completely mad?

1733
01:04:14,867 --> 01:04:16,433
But you can't do that.

1734
01:04:16,567 --> 01:04:17,567
Look at it in the constitution.

1735
01:04:17,633 --> 01:04:18,767
But Your Majesty,
with no Parliament

1736
01:04:18,867 --> 01:04:20,367
the state ceases to exist.
No.

1737
01:04:20,467 --> 01:04:21,167
It doesn't.

1738
01:04:21,267 --> 01:04:22,267
I am the state.

1739
01:04:22,367 --> 01:04:24,367
I shan't be a party
to any such idiocy.

1740
01:04:24,467 --> 01:04:25,400
- You mean you resign?
- I do.

1741
01:04:25,567 --> 01:04:26,767
Splendid.

1742
01:04:26,867 --> 01:04:29,033
I've had your resignation
typewritten for quite some time

1743
01:04:29,133 --> 01:04:29,833
just in case.

1744
01:04:29,933 --> 01:04:30,733
Sign right there.

1745
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:31,867
Oh.

1746
01:04:31,967 --> 01:04:33,800
Dr. Fellman, I appoint
you prime minister.

1747
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,733
You're to form a cabinet
and have a general election

1748
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:37,033
for a new parliament at once.

1749
01:04:37,133 --> 01:04:38,467
If the fate of our country
is entrusted to these men

1750
01:04:38,567 --> 01:04:39,733
it'll mean death
and dishonor for us

1751
01:04:39,833 --> 01:04:42,167
all, for everything
we've cherished.

1752
01:04:42,267 --> 01:04:44,167
Northrup, it's high
time you were taken down.

1753
01:04:44,267 --> 01:04:45,467
You've been
insufferably arrogant.

1754
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:47,267
You seem to forget
that in this as

1755
01:04:47,367 --> 01:04:51,367
in every well-ordered monarchy,
the throne is supreme.

1756
01:04:51,467 --> 01:04:52,167
There, Northrup.

1757
01:04:52,267 --> 01:04:53,033
That's that.

1758
01:04:53,133 --> 01:04:55,767
Your Majesty, I am a soldier.

1759
01:04:55,867 --> 01:04:59,933
I should continue to devote
my life to my country.

1760
01:05:00,033 --> 01:05:01,367
Very well said, Northrup.

1761
01:05:01,467 --> 01:05:05,033
As a soldier, you can help us
enforce the laws, the new laws.

1762
01:05:05,133 --> 01:05:06,567
Good day, general.

1763
01:05:06,667 --> 01:05:07,367
Good day, Lord Birten.

1764
01:05:07,467 --> 01:05:09,967
You're out of a job too.

1765
01:05:10,067 --> 01:05:13,300
Your Majesty, my services
are always at your command.

1766
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,900
We can always do
with a good diplomat.

1767
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:15,867
Good afternoon.
Good day, sir.

1768
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,233
It worked.

1769
01:05:21,333 --> 01:05:22,567
You both handled splendidly.

1770
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:25,567
Your Majesty, your people
will bless you for this.

1771
01:05:25,633 --> 01:05:26,667
Thank you.

1772
01:05:26,767 --> 01:05:28,600
They will never cease
to honor your name.

1773
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:29,400
I know, Mr. Laker.

1774
01:05:29,567 --> 01:05:30,267
You are a king, sir.

1775
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,233
We must got to the cathedral.

1776
01:05:31,333 --> 01:05:32,900
A real [inaudible].

1777
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,567
We are proud of you, sir.

1778
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,967
Goodbye, doctor.

1779
01:05:36,067 --> 01:05:37,467
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

1780
01:05:37,567 --> 01:05:38,933
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

1781
01:05:47,933 --> 01:05:50,267
What possessed you to do this?

1782
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:51,633
I wanted to save
the wedding, my dear.

1783
01:05:51,733 --> 01:05:52,467
I wanted to prevent
a revolution.

1784
01:05:52,567 --> 01:05:53,633
It seemed the only way to...

1785
01:05:53,733 --> 01:05:55,267
Nobody had any intention
of throwing bombs,

1786
01:05:55,367 --> 01:05:56,100
and you know it.

1787
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,733
You made the whole thing up.

1788
01:05:57,833 --> 01:06:00,567
The revolution was
nothing but a bluff.

1789
01:06:00,667 --> 01:06:02,933
How'd you guess that?

1790
01:06:03,033 --> 01:06:03,833
I'm not a fool.

1791
01:06:08,233 --> 01:06:09,567
Well, I had to get
rid of Northrup.

1792
01:06:09,667 --> 01:06:11,600
And it seemed the only way.

1793
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,600
I had to do something desperate.

1794
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:17,567
So quietly without anyone
knowing, not even you, my dear,

1795
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:22,600
I made friends with Dr. Fellman
and his friend, Mr. Laker.

1796
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:24,367
If you'd left it
to me, I'd have

1797
01:06:24,467 --> 01:06:27,700
got rid of Northrup and with
no assistance from Dr. Fellman

1798
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,567
either.

1799
01:06:28,667 --> 01:06:30,700
But I shan't complain of that.

1800
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,667
The fact remains
Northrup is gone.

1801
01:06:33,767 --> 01:06:35,400
The wedding is safe.

1802
01:06:35,567 --> 01:06:38,233
The supremacy of the
throne is established.

1803
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:40,267
And I shall now
be able to conduct

1804
01:06:40,367 --> 01:06:44,133
this state without
interference of any kind.

1805
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:44,933
Yes, my dear.

1806
01:06:45,033 --> 01:06:46,600
I knew you'd be pleased.

1807
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:48,900
[horns blowing]

1808
01:06:50,367 --> 01:06:51,300
Well, we're late already.

1809
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,567
We must start at once.

1810
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:53,800
So do please hurry.

1811
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:55,867
And I'll wait for Anne.

1812
01:06:55,967 --> 01:06:56,800
Now, remember...

1813
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:58,633
Attend!

1814
01:06:58,733 --> 01:07:01,267
When you and Anne are driving
through the crowded street,

1815
01:07:01,367 --> 01:07:03,733
and especially when you
are walking up the aisle,

1816
01:07:03,833 --> 01:07:07,067
I want you to appear
radiantly happy.

1817
01:07:07,167 --> 01:07:09,033
We'll all be smiling
brightly, my dear.

1818
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:12,367
Salute!

1819
01:07:18,233 --> 01:07:19,600
- Oh, Phipps.
- Yes, sir.

1820
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:20,567
That son-in-law of yours.

1821
01:07:20,667 --> 01:07:21,800
Oh, him.

1822
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,367
Does he play checkers?

1823
01:07:23,467 --> 01:07:24,633
I... I believe he does, sir.

1824
01:07:24,733 --> 01:07:25,433
Good.

1825
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,467
We'll have a tournament.

1826
01:07:26,567 --> 01:07:27,600
Oh, no, no, no, sir.

1827
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:28,733
You mustn't do that.

1828
01:07:28,833 --> 01:07:30,633
I want to teach you
not to be such a snob.

1829
01:07:30,733 --> 01:07:31,567
And Phipps...

1830
01:07:31,633 --> 01:07:32,333
Yes, sir.

1831
01:07:37,167 --> 01:07:38,200
Tell that to Major
Blent at once.

1832
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:39,900
It's important.
Yes, sir.

1833
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:40,667
Very well, sir.

1834
01:07:54,933 --> 01:07:55,633
I'm ready, father.

1835
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:10,067
My darling child, wherever
you go, whatever you do,

1836
01:08:10,167 --> 01:08:11,900
I want you to know
that I love you.

1837
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,700
Never mind all
that, we have to go.

1838
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,033
We mustn't keep them waiting.

1839
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:18,000
It wouldn't look right.

1840
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:19,733
We must never do
anything as long as we

1841
01:08:19,833 --> 01:08:22,233
live that doesn't look right.

1842
01:08:22,333 --> 01:08:23,567
You do blame me
for this, don't you?

1843
01:08:23,633 --> 01:08:25,067
Of course, I blame you,
but I'm going through

1844
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:27,233
with it, every bit of it.

1845
01:08:27,333 --> 01:08:28,567
And I never want
to see you again,

1846
01:08:28,667 --> 01:08:33,067
or mother, or anyone else in
this hateful, cruel place.

1847
01:08:33,167 --> 01:08:35,567
(WHISPERING) Your
Majesty, he's here.

1848
01:08:35,633 --> 01:08:36,567
Send him in.

1849
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:40,867
Freddie.

1850
01:08:40,967 --> 01:08:42,333
Why, Anne.

1851
01:08:42,433 --> 01:08:43,933
- Oh, darling.
- Darling.

1852
01:08:44,033 --> 01:08:45,200
Don't let them take me.
Kill them.

1853
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:46,033
Do anything.

1854
01:08:46,133 --> 01:08:47,833
But don't let them take me.

1855
01:08:47,933 --> 01:08:48,967
Would you step this way please?

1856
01:08:52,367 --> 01:08:54,267
Frederick, do you take this
woman for your lawful wife?

1857
01:08:54,367 --> 01:08:55,567
You do.

1858
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,800
Anne, do you take this man
for your lawful husband?

1859
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:57,900
You do.

1860
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,467
Do you promise to
love, honor, and obey?

1861
01:08:59,567 --> 01:09:00,300
You do.

1862
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,367
You wed her with this ring.

1863
01:09:02,467 --> 01:09:04,367
You endow her with all
your worldly goods.

1864
01:09:04,467 --> 01:09:05,900
Let no man put asunder.

1865
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
As king by the grace
of God, as lord vicar

1866
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,333
of the holy church
in this our country,

1867
01:09:09,433 --> 01:09:11,600
I pronounce you man and wife.

1868
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:13,700
Blent, give me that
order of exile.

1869
01:09:18,067 --> 01:09:19,767
Father, what are you doing?

1870
01:09:19,867 --> 01:09:24,267
I'm adding the words "and wife"
to Frederick Granton's name.

1871
01:09:24,367 --> 01:09:25,633
Are we married?

1872
01:09:25,733 --> 01:09:26,667
I should hope so.

1873
01:09:30,767 --> 01:09:31,467
Phipps.

1874
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:32,433
Yes, sir.

1875
01:09:32,567 --> 01:09:34,067
You and Blent
are the witnesses.

1876
01:09:34,167 --> 01:09:35,933
Thank you, sir.

1877
01:09:36,033 --> 01:09:37,967
You're sailing in a few
moments on the steamship Caleo.

1878
01:09:38,067 --> 01:09:39,900
I thought it best
for you to be married

1879
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,333
respectfully before you left.

1880
01:09:41,433 --> 01:09:42,967
I don't think your mother would
like it if you went under less

1881
01:09:43,067 --> 01:09:43,867
conventional circumstances.

1882
01:09:46,567 --> 01:09:48,067
But sir, does... does the
queen know about this?

1883
01:09:48,167 --> 01:09:49,267
Not yet.

1884
01:09:49,367 --> 01:09:51,667
Oh, father, I can't
forget the things I said.

1885
01:09:51,767 --> 01:09:53,100
And neither can I.
But the memory of them

1886
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,033
will give me many laughs between
the long winter evenings.

1887
01:09:55,133 --> 01:09:56,600
Now, Blent will take
you to the boat.

1888
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:58,467
But sir, I'd like to
say something really.

1889
01:09:58,567 --> 01:09:59,267
I... I know.

1890
01:09:59,367 --> 01:10:00,067
But don't say it.

1891
01:10:00,167 --> 01:10:01,333
You'd only stammer.

1892
01:10:01,433 --> 01:10:02,133
Goodbye, my darling.

1893
01:10:07,667 --> 01:10:09,233
I'll send you the marriage
license to Panama.

1894
01:10:09,333 --> 01:10:10,967
But what are you going to
say to mother, and Prince

1895
01:10:11,067 --> 01:10:11,833
William, and all the rest?

1896
01:10:11,933 --> 01:10:12,967
I'll be very firm.

1897
01:10:13,067 --> 01:10:15,200
I'll let them know
that I am the king.

1898
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:16,267
Now, Granton, take her away.

1899
01:10:16,367 --> 01:10:17,133
Take her.

1900
01:10:17,233 --> 01:10:18,467
She's messing up all my medals.

1901
01:10:18,567 --> 01:10:19,433
Goodbye, darling.

1902
01:10:19,533 --> 01:10:20,267
Goodbye, dear.

1903
01:10:20,367 --> 01:10:22,067
Goodbye.

1904
01:10:22,167 --> 01:10:23,567
Take off that bridal veil.

1905
01:10:23,667 --> 01:10:24,533
Put on a heavy overcoat.

1906
01:10:30,133 --> 01:10:31,033
Go with them, Blent.

1907
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:08,967
I hate this hat.

1908
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:13,467
It always gives me a headache.

1909
01:11:17,067 --> 01:11:19,833
But you won't be going
to the cathedral now, sir.

1910
01:11:19,933 --> 01:11:20,633
Will you?

1911
01:11:23,567 --> 01:11:25,667
Yes, I'll be going
to the cathedral now.

1912
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:29,833
But I will be back shortly.

1913
01:11:44,567 --> 01:11:46,000
And you have that
checkerboard ready.

1914
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,433
