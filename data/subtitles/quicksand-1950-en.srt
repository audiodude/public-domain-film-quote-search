1
00:01:30,434 --> 00:01:31,622
How's the pie?

2
00:01:31,935 --> 00:01:33,070
Fine.

3
00:01:33,217 --> 00:01:34,904
Buzz, how's the fishing you think?

4
00:01:35,404 --> 00:01:38,542
It's not very good around here but
there's a big run of marlin in Tijuana.

5
00:01:39,042 --> 00:01:40,658
I'm taking a party down there
Sunday morning.

6
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:41,471
How do you like this guy?

7
00:01:41,508 --> 00:01:44,021
He gets paid to go fishing while we
slave over a hot carburetor.

8
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:44,853
You said it.

9
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,685
Hey, Dan, we got room for one more.
Why don't you come along.

10
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:48,629
When are you going to get back?

11
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:49,633
Late Monday night.

12
00:01:49,696 --> 00:01:51,785
Monday night, that lets me out.
I couldn't get Monday off.

13
00:01:52,566 --> 00:01:54,566
You could get away if you wanted to.

14
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:57,066
You just don't want to miss spending
Sunday with your girlfriend.

15
00:01:57,171 --> 00:01:57,969
Huh?

16
00:01:58,168 --> 00:02:00,168
Nah, they busted up
a couple of months ago.

17
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:01,910
By the way, she called you
again this morning.

18
00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:03,505
She did?

19
00:02:03,612 --> 00:02:05,839
I told her you wasn't in
for the 19th time.

20
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:07,125
Good, good.

21
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:08,262
How do you like this guy?

22
00:02:08,312 --> 00:02:10,835
There's a dame I'd trade my right arm
for and he gives her the runaround.

23
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:12,163
Maybe he's starting a new dish.

24
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,740
I spend four years in the navy,

25
00:02:13,787 --> 00:02:15,787
fighting for freedom,
why get anchored down now?

26
00:02:15,837 --> 00:02:17,327
Besides, she was getting too serious.

27
00:02:17,368 --> 00:02:18,432
Hearing wedding bells, huh?

28
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:19,829
They were getting louder and louder.

29
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:21,934
I figure she's too nice to string along.

30
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:23,832
She won't take no for an answer.

31
00:02:24,332 --> 00:02:26,218
Some dames are sure hard to shake off.

32
00:02:26,562 --> 00:02:28,082
I once knew a blonde...

33
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:30,582
And her name was Marjie.

34
00:02:30,773 --> 00:02:31,692
How did you know?

35
00:02:31,742 --> 00:02:33,307
We've heard the story a dozen times.

36
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:35,038
A couple of dozen times.

37
00:02:35,842 --> 00:02:38,498
Hey, we better be getting back
or old man Mackey will blow a fuse.

38
00:02:38,548 --> 00:02:39,851
Right. Here, that's for you.

39
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:44,382
Hey.

40
00:02:52,738 --> 00:02:53,798
Some babe.

41
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:55,138
Yeah.

42
00:03:14,956 --> 00:03:16,178
See you later, fellows.

43
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,612
I got work to do.

44
00:03:23,122 --> 00:03:25,122
You new here, honey?

45
00:03:26,421 --> 00:03:27,965
$2.65 out of a dollar.

46
00:03:29,146 --> 00:03:30,444
What time do you get off tonight?

47
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:33,433
6:30?

48
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:34,900
7:00?

49
00:03:35,988 --> 00:03:37,122
Don't forget your change.

50
00:03:38,736 --> 00:03:40,788
I happen to have
my autograph book here with me.

51
00:03:41,326 --> 00:03:42,684
Name and address?

52
00:03:43,551 --> 00:03:45,115
I'm afraid you've made a mistake.

53
00:03:45,615 --> 00:03:47,408
I don't come with the merchant's lunch.

54
00:03:47,557 --> 00:03:48,966
Don't be like that.

55
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,038
I think you're wonderful.

56
00:03:51,621 --> 00:03:52,820
Anything wrong in that?

57
00:03:52,855 --> 00:03:53,778
No, but...

58
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,118
What about you and me tonight?

59
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:55,706
Huh?

60
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:58,041
I work tonight.
-Till when?

61
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:01,175
Till 9:30.

62
00:04:01,644 --> 00:04:02,551
You like...

63
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:04,303
Do you like Red Nichols and his outfit?

64
00:04:04,688 --> 00:04:05,917
Yeah, I think they're great.

65
00:04:06,256 --> 00:04:07,835
They're playing at the music bar
on the pier..

66
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:09,632
I thought I'd pick you up at 9:30 and...

67
00:04:10,476 --> 00:04:11,938
We'll go give them a listen, OK?

68
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:14,438
OK.

69
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,289
See you tonight.

70
00:04:21,664 --> 00:04:23,497
Seventy-five out of one.

71
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:27,321
Hey, Chuck.

72
00:04:28,111 --> 00:04:29,373
I just remembered something.

73
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:33,874
Remembered what?

74
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,674
It's five days till payday
and I'm flat busted.

75
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:38,162
How are you holding?

76
00:04:38,662 --> 00:04:39,429
I'm broke.

77
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:40,542
Me too.

78
00:04:41,553 --> 00:04:43,430
I gotta figure out some way
to get some money

79
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,966
or how else am I going to take that
gorgeous creature out to the music bar?

80
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:50,065
Why don't you ask old man Mackey
for an advance?

81
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:53,148
That old guy wouldn't give you
the sweat off his glasses.

82
00:04:53,435 --> 00:04:56,122
Yeah, he's sure a mean old buzzard.

83
00:04:56,965 --> 00:04:58,683
Hey, buzzard. I'm glad you said that.

84
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,194
Buzz Larson owes me twenty bucks.

85
00:05:00,244 --> 00:05:01,567
Why don't you call him up
down at the dock?

86
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:04,182
Friend, you have just read my mind.

87
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,480
Hello, is Buzz Larson there, please?

88
00:05:23,512 --> 00:05:24,980
Oh, hello, Buzz.

89
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:26,652
Hi, boy, this is Dan.

90
00:05:27,565 --> 00:05:28,667
Listen uh...

91
00:05:29,327 --> 00:05:31,083
Could you let me have that twenty bucks
you owe me?

92
00:05:32,646 --> 00:05:33,453
Oh.

93
00:05:33,953 --> 00:05:35,030
That's swell.

94
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:36,776
Believe me, you're a life saver.

95
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:39,543
I'll be down tonight to pick it up.

96
00:05:40,486 --> 00:05:41,110
Huh?

97
00:05:41,984 --> 00:05:44,464
Tomorrow? Oh, wait a minute, boy.

98
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,944
I need it right away.

99
00:05:49,706 --> 00:05:50,941
You don't get paid until tomorrow.

100
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:53,441
Yeah.

101
00:05:54,681 --> 00:05:55,849
I understand. Sure.

102
00:05:58,076 --> 00:06:00,076
OK. All right, thanks anyway, kid.

103
00:06:00,996 --> 00:06:01,706
Bye.

104
00:06:02,985 --> 00:06:05,223
Who left that light on in the washroom?

105
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,411
Not me.

106
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:07,534
It was one of you fellows.

107
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:09,867
You're all alike. You don't care
what you do with my money.

108
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:12,645
You think I own stock
in the power company?

109
00:06:24,902 --> 00:06:26,902
So she said to me,
"I want to speak to the supervisor."

110
00:06:27,143 --> 00:06:29,495
So I says, "One moment, please."

111
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:31,282
And then I says,

112
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:34,410
"Yes, this is the supervisor speaking." 

113
00:06:35,544 --> 00:06:38,025
Helen Calder, are you listening to me?

114
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,011
Yeah.

115
00:06:39,295 --> 00:06:41,018
I don't think you've heard one word.

116
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,558
You just seem to be walking around
in a dream lately.

117
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,838
Millie, I think I'll say goodbye
to you here

118
00:06:46,888 --> 00:06:48,697
there are things I have to get.

119
00:06:48,914 --> 00:06:50,555
What things? Where?

120
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,535
Oh, just some things.

121
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:53,990
Over on State Street.

122
00:06:54,382 --> 00:06:56,136
I know where you're going, Helen.

123
00:06:56,186 --> 00:06:57,825
And you're making a big mistake.

124
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,227
If he wants to see you,
he knows your telephone number.

125
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:01,945
I know but...

126
00:07:01,995 --> 00:07:02,818
But nothing.

127
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:04,944
You're making a fool of yourself.

128
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,661
I don't think I am.

129
00:07:07,054 --> 00:07:07,895
Goodbye.

130
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:15,472
Well when you need it

131
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:18,212
fast sometimes.
You haven't got time to...

132
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,213
What?

133
00:07:19,263 --> 00:07:20,147
A standard lighter.

134
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,181
No, no, not you, Ed.

135
00:07:23,963 --> 00:07:24,910
Yeah, sure.

136
00:07:25,517 --> 00:07:27,989
Well, if you haven't got it,
you can't lend it to me.

137
00:07:28,871 --> 00:07:30,330
Yeah. All right.

138
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:32,830
Thanks a lot, bye.

139
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:33,893
Did you squeeze Buzz?

140
00:07:33,943 --> 00:07:36,538
Yeah, I called him, Ray, Chris.
None of them have it.

141
00:07:36,594 --> 00:07:37,166
How bad?

142
00:07:37,216 --> 00:07:38,054
A dollar three.

143
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:38,757
Exact change.

144
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:40,909
There you go.

145
00:07:58,822 --> 00:08:01,275
<i>Nobody checks my cash except
this once a week bookkeeper

146
00:08:01,325 --> 00:08:03,117
<i>and he don't come around till Thursday.

147
00:08:03,468 --> 00:08:06,220
<i>I could put it back before Thursday.
I could put it back tomorrow.

148
00:08:06,537 --> 00:08:08,537
<i>As soon as I get that twenty bucks
 from Buzz.

149
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:35,240
Dan.

150
00:08:36,176 --> 00:08:37,264
Oh, Danny.

151
00:08:37,521 --> 00:08:38,759
Oh, hello, Helen.

152
00:08:39,906 --> 00:08:41,644
This is a surprise.
-Yeah.

153
00:08:42,144 --> 00:08:43,656
Yeah, how's every little thing?

154
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:45,811
Just fine.
-That's good.

155
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:48,311
Well, I'll see you later, huh?

156
00:08:48,405 --> 00:08:49,859
Have you been dancing lately?

157
00:08:50,024 --> 00:08:52,024
Yeah, I went last Saturday.

158
00:08:53,697 --> 00:08:55,130
Do you ever go hiking anymore?

159
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:56,937
Once in a while.

160
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,569
Do you remember the time we
hiked up Pioneer Canyon?

161
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:00,616
Yeah.

162
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,368
Didn't we have fun?

163
00:09:02,462 --> 00:09:03,029
Yeah.

164
00:09:05,193 --> 00:09:06,503
Well, Danny...

165
00:09:06,956 --> 00:09:08,291
Will you give me a ring sometime?

166
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:10,341
Sure, I'll give you a ring
and we'll get together real soon.

167
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,841
I'll see you later. I've got...

168
00:09:13,108 --> 00:09:14,315
I'll give you a ring soon.

169
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:46,546
Taxi, lady?

170
00:09:48,195 --> 00:09:49,218
Where's your meter?

171
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,489
I'll figure out the fare as we go along.

172
00:09:54,784 --> 00:09:56,155
You might over charge me.

173
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:58,434
I might at that.

174
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,307
Hop in, honey.

175
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:02,733
Where would you like to go?

176
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:06,654
Let's go downtown, window shopping.

177
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:08,912
How dull can you get?

178
00:10:10,412 --> 00:10:11,706
Well, that's what I want to do.

179
00:10:12,848 --> 00:10:13,846
We can uh...

180
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:14,970
We can do

181
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:16,278
something else later.

182
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:19,306
You have a deal, honey.

183
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,180
It's still here.

184
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,763
Nice looking coat.

185
00:10:37,374 --> 00:10:39,776
Bet they'd suck you at least
a thousand bucks for a coat like that.

186
00:10:40,136 --> 00:10:41,102
Are you kidding?

187
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:42,333
Why, that's mink.

188
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,316
It's a bargain at two thousand.

189
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:48,529
Isn't that the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen in your life?

190
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:49,880
It's not bad.

191
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,711
Are you thinking on buying it?

192
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:54,211
I want that coat.

193
00:10:55,604 --> 00:10:58,035
And I'm going to get it.
-For two thousand dollars?

194
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,761
For whatever it takes.

195
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,409
Say, wait a minute you

196
00:11:02,665 --> 00:11:04,089
You really do want it, don't you?

197
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:05,720
You bet I do.

198
00:11:14,302 --> 00:11:15,439
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

199
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:16,103
Huh?

200
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:18,153
Ah, they're blue.
-No.

201
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:19,167
They're brown.

202
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:22,339
Ah, but there's blues
in your big brown eyes.

203
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:23,933
Oh, you sing too.

204
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,047
Only for you, honey.

205
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,255
Shall we go?

206
00:11:31,646 --> 00:11:32,921
Closed Mondays.

207
00:11:33,251 --> 00:11:34,547
How do you like that?

208
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:36,870
Are you sure you didn't happen to know

209
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:38,180
it was closed when you invited me?

210
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,096
Now wait a minute.
Would I do a thing like that?

211
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:42,371
I'll take you anyplace you want to go.
Name it and you can have it.

212
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:45,668
All right.

213
00:11:46,813 --> 00:11:47,851
All right.

214
00:11:48,572 --> 00:11:50,572
I know a place I'd like to go.

215
00:11:57,537 --> 00:11:59,537
Bang, bang, bang, bang.

216
00:12:05,109 --> 00:12:06,596
Hey, get out of here.

217
00:12:06,978 --> 00:12:08,978
Stop that, you silly brats.

218
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:10,156
You hear me?

219
00:12:10,235 --> 00:12:12,235
I'll save you all the trouble
of growing up.

220
00:12:17,444 --> 00:12:19,871
Cut that out.
You want to break the machine?

221
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:21,208
Hello, Nick.

222
00:12:22,404 --> 00:12:23,708
Oh, it's you.

223
00:12:24,924 --> 00:12:27,323
Gimme a nickel, Danny.
I'll show you how to beat this game.

224
00:12:38,016 --> 00:12:39,663
Wait a minute!

225
00:12:42,878 --> 00:12:43,851
One ball.

226
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,114
Hey, Nick,

227
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,044
Pay me.

228
00:12:46,227 --> 00:12:47,538
I hit the jackpot.

229
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,191
Here.

230
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,311
That's all. For you.

231
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:57,183
Hey, wait a minute.

232
00:13:01,543 --> 00:13:03,263
Go ahead, honey, play it
as much as you want.

233
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:04,778
Take it easy, Danny.

234
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:06,954
I can handle Nick myself.

235
00:13:08,612 --> 00:13:09,660
I used to work here.

236
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,086
Didn't I, Nick?
-Yeah.

237
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:15,516
Want to come back?

238
00:13:16,932 --> 00:13:18,201
It's still in the window, Nick.

239
00:13:18,886 --> 00:13:20,886
I saw it yesterday.
-Are you crazy?

240
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:23,089
What do you think I am? A millionaire?

241
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,624
What's going on here?

242
00:13:26,508 --> 00:13:27,550
Let's skip it.

243
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,426
Come on, we'll have our pictures taken.

244
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:30,896
Come on.

245
00:13:33,132 --> 00:13:34,206
See you later, Nick.

246
00:13:35,193 --> 00:13:36,112
Who goes first?

247
00:13:36,612 --> 00:13:37,439
We both go.

248
00:13:50,473 --> 00:13:51,259
What do you want?

249
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,059
Gimme a half buck's worth of nickels.

250
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:55,173
OK, admiral.

251
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,492
Now what do you want?

252
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,467
There's only nine nickels there, buddy.

253
00:14:08,517 --> 00:14:09,009
Yeah?

254
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,509
Who's cheating who?

255
00:14:12,304 --> 00:14:14,001
Look, you got your nickel, haven't you?

256
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:15,298
Hit the road.

257
00:14:27,884 --> 00:14:28,949
Why hello, Nick.

258
00:14:29,044 --> 00:14:30,786
Look, I've got rules in this house.

259
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,248
That goes for you too.

260
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,785
If you want to pull that kind of stuff,
go somewhere else.

261
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,775
Come on, beat it. Beat it!

262
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,110
Come on, Vera, let's get out of this
crummy joint.

263
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:53,738
Goodbye, Nick.

264
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,701
See that big star right there?

265
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:35,036
Yeah.

266
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:37,536
That's Beetlejerz.

267
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:39,022
Who?

268
00:15:39,257 --> 00:15:40,288
Beetlejerz.

269
00:15:40,478 --> 00:15:42,478
Beetlejuice, Dave used to call it.

270
00:15:42,978 --> 00:15:43,634
Dave.

271
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,134
Who's Dave?

272
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:48,188
A fellow I used to know.

273
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:50,355
He taught me the names of all the stars.

274
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:52,921
You know, I never saw a star
until I was sixteen?

275
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,022
How come?

276
00:15:58,693 --> 00:16:00,693
I was raised
in Steeltown, West Virginia.

277
00:16:00,743 --> 00:16:02,322
And you couldn't see the sky
for the smoke.

278
00:16:02,822 --> 00:16:04,318
So I ran away.

279
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,596
Funny, I ran away from home too.

280
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:09,096
That was a long, long time ago.

281
00:16:11,757 --> 00:16:14,230
I uh..What did you do after you
ran away from home?

282
00:16:15,202 --> 00:16:18,123
I was a car hop for a while,
waitress in a beer joint,

283
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:20,502
clerk in a five and ten,

284
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:22,040
cashier in a coffee shop.

285
00:16:23,543 --> 00:16:25,890
It's not what you run away to,
it's what you run away from.

286
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,318
I ran away from a farm and the belt
the old man used to whip me with.

287
00:16:29,818 --> 00:16:31,626
My old man sure was free with that belt.

288
00:16:32,038 --> 00:16:33,698
I ran away from a lot of things.

289
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:36,382
Ma getting drunk all the time

290
00:16:36,432 --> 00:16:38,432
and never having any
decent clothes to wear.

291
00:16:39,276 --> 00:16:40,659
And the boarders.

292
00:16:40,812 --> 00:16:42,465
Especially those boarders.

293
00:16:42,707 --> 00:16:44,127
They wouldn't leave me alone.

294
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,030
It must have been tough.

295
00:16:47,857 --> 00:16:49,857
I learned to handle them after a while.

296
00:16:51,855 --> 00:16:53,389
Think you can handle me?

297
00:16:53,523 --> 00:16:54,901
Sure.

298
00:16:58,912 --> 00:17:00,506
I can handle you easy.

299
00:17:01,433 --> 00:17:02,406
Yeah?

300
00:17:11,749 --> 00:17:13,084
Hello, is Buzz there?

301
00:17:14,804 --> 00:17:15,584
He what?

302
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,736
Took a fishing party?
When will he be back?

303
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,184
No.

304
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:23,649
No, never mind. I'll...

305
00:17:24,914 --> 00:17:26,149
All right. I'll call him later.

306
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:26,746
Bye.

307
00:17:34,683 --> 00:17:35,514
<i>The bookkeeper.

308
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:38,014
<i>What's he doing here two days
ahead of time?

309
00:17:38,226 --> 00:17:40,226
<i>If he finds out I'm short,
he'll tell the old man.

310
00:17:40,785 --> 00:17:43,529
<i>The old man's mean enough to
send a guy to jail just for laughs.

311
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,029
<i>I gotta get twenty bucks in a hurry.

312
00:17:50,216 --> 00:17:52,216
<i>How about that Salary Loan outfit.

313
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,207
<i>The one that's always yackin'
on the radio,

314
00:17:54,257 --> 00:17:56,835
<i>"Walk in with an honest face, walk out
with a pocket full of dough."

315
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,587
<i>I must have walked in
with the wrong face.

316
00:18:02,726 --> 00:18:04,726
<i>A couple of days to check my references.

317
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:07,596
<i>I haven't got any references
and I haven't got a couple of days.

318
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:33,791
THIS WEEK ONLY
ONE DOLLAR DOWN
BUYS ANY WATCH IN THIS WINDOW

319
00:18:47,573 --> 00:18:50,055
Can I have it for a dollar down
like it says in the window?

320
00:18:50,105 --> 00:18:51,697
Soon as we've checked up on your credit.

321
00:18:52,337 --> 00:18:53,048
Credit.

322
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,104
I can't wait that long.
-Wait a minute.

323
00:18:57,154 --> 00:18:58,998
You got a charge account in town?

324
00:19:00,287 --> 00:19:01,120
No.

325
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:03,240
Yes, I have.

326
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:05,993
The hub. At the Hub
where I buy my clothes.

327
00:19:06,036 --> 00:19:07,160
I tell you what I'll do.

328
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:09,887
I'll call their credit manager and if he
says you're OK,

329
00:19:09,937 --> 00:19:11,440
you can take the watch right with you.

330
00:19:11,523 --> 00:19:12,193
OK?

331
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,078
Now, let's get it on
and show you what it looks like.

332
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:22,335
How much could you let me have
on this ticker?

333
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,488
Thirty dollars do you any good?

334
00:19:30,187 --> 00:19:31,401
Thirty dollars will be fine.

335
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,534
Any better than last week?

336
00:19:41,643 --> 00:19:43,896
I don't know yet, Mr. Mackey.
I'll let you know.

337
00:19:44,374 --> 00:19:45,480
About that other matter,

338
00:19:45,516 --> 00:19:46,491
see if you can't find a way

339
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,796
to make it a business deduction.

340
00:19:48,281 --> 00:19:49,728
I'll think about it, Mr. Mackey.

341
00:20:00,387 --> 00:20:01,196
Hi, George.

342
00:20:01,327 --> 00:20:02,265
Hi, Danny.

343
00:20:03,185 --> 00:20:04,189
You're uh...

344
00:20:04,763 --> 00:20:06,232
You're here kind of early
this week, aren't you?

345
00:20:06,732 --> 00:20:07,857
The old man sent for me.

346
00:20:08,092 --> 00:20:10,054
He had some tax reports
for me to get out.

347
00:20:10,104 --> 00:20:10,601
Oh.

348
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,978
And I figured as long as I was here,
I'd get my Thursday work done.

349
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,326
Say, Dan.

350
00:20:19,826 --> 00:20:22,561
I just checked the register
and it's $20 short.

351
00:20:25,222 --> 00:20:27,222
Maybe you could have
made a mistake or something.

352
00:20:27,722 --> 00:20:29,450
No, I checked it twice.

353
00:20:31,182 --> 00:20:31,950
Well...

354
00:20:32,201 --> 00:20:34,450
Sometimes the money gets stuck
in the money sack down there.

355
00:20:41,513 --> 00:20:42,200
Yeah.

356
00:20:42,258 --> 00:20:43,100
Yeah, here it is.

357
00:20:46,218 --> 00:20:47,811
I looked in the money sack.

358
00:20:48,674 --> 00:20:49,869
You just didn't look good enough.

359
00:21:04,321 --> 00:21:05,458
Can I do anything for you, sir?

360
00:21:05,693 --> 00:21:06,634
Are you Dan Brady?

361
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:07,411
Yeah.

362
00:21:13,112 --> 00:21:14,255
I'm Moriarity.

363
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:16,422
California Investigation Service.

364
00:21:17,908 --> 00:21:20,184
You bought a watch yesterday
at Jay's Jewelers, didn't you?

365
00:21:21,612 --> 00:21:22,676
Yeah, I did.

366
00:21:22,726 --> 00:21:24,282
And took it straight to Uncle John's
and hocked it.

367
00:21:26,766 --> 00:21:27,630
What if I did?

368
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:30,466
Don't play dumb. Why would you buy
a watch for a hundred dollars

369
00:21:30,516 --> 00:21:31,855
and hock it the same day for thirty?

370
00:21:33,185 --> 00:21:34,060
Well, I...

371
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:36,162
Because you don't intend
to pay the hundred. That's why.

372
00:21:36,691 --> 00:21:38,240
Wait a minute.
Don't holler before you're hurt.

373
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,773
I signed up to pay that thing

374
00:21:39,845 --> 00:21:42,133
ten bucks a month and when the month's
up, I'll pay them the ten bucks.

375
00:21:42,331 --> 00:21:43,335
No, you won't.

376
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,159
Because Jay Jewelers don't think you're
going to be here when the month's up.

377
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:48,149
They think you're going to skip town.

378
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:51,114
So you'll pay up now or Jay's going to
swear out a warrant.

379
00:21:52,716 --> 00:21:53,503
Warrant?

380
00:21:54,364 --> 00:21:55,231
Warrant for what?

381
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,731
I'll give it to you in words
of one syllable, my friend.

382
00:21:58,238 --> 00:22:01,238
When you buy something on the
installment plan you sign what they call

383
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:02,700
a conditional sales contract.

384
00:22:02,803 --> 00:22:03,497
Yeah?

385
00:22:03,687 --> 00:22:05,494
This contract says that the watch

386
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,107
the radio or the easy chair

387
00:22:07,607 --> 00:22:09,770
don't belong to you till
you make your last payment.

388
00:22:10,469 --> 00:22:12,813
It says that if you sell,
mortgage or hock

389
00:22:13,225 --> 00:22:14,593
something you don't own yet,

390
00:22:14,997 --> 00:22:16,133
you're guilty of larceny.

391
00:22:16,463 --> 00:22:18,463
And a hundred dollar watch
is grand larceny.

392
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,538
That's three years in the penitentiary
in this state.

393
00:22:24,605 --> 00:22:25,458
You're kidding me, aren't you?

394
00:22:25,508 --> 00:22:26,658
Kidding? Me?

395
00:22:27,571 --> 00:22:28,519
Not on your life.

396
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:31,779
You signed a contract like this,
didn't you?

397
00:22:32,862 --> 00:22:33,497
Yeah.

398
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:34,845
Read what it says right there.

399
00:22:37,738 --> 00:22:38,945
Debt is payable...

400
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:41,445
Within 24 hours
or charges will be brought.

401
00:22:44,115 --> 00:22:45,030
Look, I...

402
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:48,844
I can't get a hold of a hundred bucks
just like that right away.

403
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,371
Well, you better dig it up somewhere.

404
00:22:56,948 --> 00:22:59,476
Because if you don't pay it by noon
tomorrow, a little man's

405
00:22:59,526 --> 00:23:01,298
going to call on you with a big warrant.

406
00:23:09,527 --> 00:23:10,654
That's all, brother.

407
00:23:11,007 --> 00:23:12,127
Till noon tomorrow.

408
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,275
Hey, Chuck.
-Yeah?

409
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,737
What does a guy do when he

410
00:23:25,872 --> 00:23:27,023
needs lots of dough?

411
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,744
Me, I usually hock my watch.

412
00:23:34,175 --> 00:23:35,245
That's a great idea.

413
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,261
<i>Maybe I can get some dough on my jalopy.

414
00:23:43,614 --> 00:23:45,074
<i>I wonder how much
they'll give me for it.

415
00:23:54,564 --> 00:23:56,378
<i>No dice. What good is
three hundred bucks?

416
00:23:56,428 --> 00:23:58,428
<i>I still owe the finance company
three fifty.

417
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:14,587
<i>By half past eight I'd tried everything
I could think of

418
00:24:14,637 --> 00:24:16,232
<i>and I still hadn't raised
a hundred dollars.

419
00:24:16,975 --> 00:24:18,975
<i>I hadn't raised a buck and a quarter.

420
00:24:19,689 --> 00:24:21,830
<i>So I threw in the towel and headed
for Phil's Place.

421
00:24:22,035 --> 00:24:23,924
<i>To knock off a couple of beers.

422
00:24:36,047 --> 00:24:39,533
<i>The longer I sat on that silly stool,
the more I felt like slugging somebody.

423
00:24:39,871 --> 00:24:42,217
<i>I could've socked old man Mackey
for being so tight.

424
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,462
<i>Or the guy in the jewelry store
for sending Moriarity after me.

425
00:24:46,471 --> 00:24:48,471
<i>Or the fellow standing
next to me at the bar.

426
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,831
<i>Because he had money in his pocket
and I didn't.

427
00:24:52,186 --> 00:24:54,038
How much do I owe you, Philly?

428
00:24:54,457 --> 00:24:55,941
Three sixty, Shorty.

429
00:24:56,522 --> 00:24:58,522
OK. I gotta get home

430
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,177
before the old lady chops my ears off.

431
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,045
Haven't you got something smaller?

432
00:25:03,147 --> 00:25:04,064
This one's a fifty.

433
00:25:04,158 --> 00:25:05,736
Well, how's this one?

434
00:25:06,777 --> 00:25:07,845
That's another fifty.

435
00:25:08,345 --> 00:25:09,286
Here, let me look.

436
00:25:10,465 --> 00:25:12,295
There's a five right there on top.

437
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,056
Oh, this one.

438
00:25:14,187 --> 00:25:14,911
Yeah.

439
00:25:15,529 --> 00:25:16,970
Just keep the change.

440
00:25:17,168 --> 00:25:21,563
I gotta get home before the old lady
slaps me down.

441
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,070
Who?

442
00:25:24,976 --> 00:25:25,725
Your wife.

443
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,063
Oh, yeah.

444
00:25:27,298 --> 00:25:29,765
Yeah, the old lady. Good night, Phil.

445
00:25:29,852 --> 00:25:30,780
So long, Shorty.

446
00:25:31,081 --> 00:25:32,860
How's a joker like that rate
all that dough?

447
00:25:33,102 --> 00:25:34,635
Shorty? He runs the bingo game.

448
00:25:34,818 --> 00:25:36,302
Do the suckers keep him happy.

449
00:25:37,326 --> 00:25:38,183
Another beer, Danny?

450
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:39,377
No.

451
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,464
That's all.

452
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:50,896
Hi Romy, how's things?

453
00:25:50,946 --> 00:25:52,627
Hi, Shorty, how's Kay?

454
00:25:58,593 --> 00:26:01,738
How you doing, nice boy?
Let me tell your fortune.

455
00:26:01,788 --> 00:26:04,745
Maybe you got big warnings...
-Just leave me alone, will you?

456
00:26:04,869 --> 00:26:07,753
Ah, go fall on your face, you jerk

457
00:26:08,268 --> 00:26:09,418
Tell your fortune?

458
00:27:03,993 --> 00:27:06,258
All right, reach. Reach, come on,
I'm not kidding you.

459
00:27:06,308 --> 00:27:07,394
Let's go.

460
00:27:09,657 --> 00:27:11,375
All right, get in the back,
down on the floor. Hurry up.

461
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:12,518
Get in.

462
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,185
Hey, Helen.

463
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:01,663
Hi, chum.

464
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:02,926
Long time, no see.

465
00:28:03,537 --> 00:28:04,989
Hi, Millie.
-Hello.

466
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,705
Jeez, Danny, it's wonderful to see you.

467
00:28:06,755 --> 00:28:08,755
Let's walk.
That's what legs are for, huh?

468
00:28:09,078 --> 00:28:12,108
What's your hurry tonight? I never saw
you run after anybody before.

469
00:28:12,195 --> 00:28:14,195
Oh, Millie, please.

470
00:28:14,422 --> 00:28:16,667
Hey, take it easy. What's the rush?

471
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,221
Nobody's chasing us.

472
00:28:19,761 --> 00:28:20,721
Yeah, that's right.

473
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:24,011
Nobody's chasing us.
We've got all night, haven't we?

474
00:28:24,058 --> 00:28:25,321
Sure, we have.

475
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:26,789
Maybe you got all night.

476
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:28,873
Me and Helen, we only got five minutes

477
00:28:28,923 --> 00:28:30,043
till the last show.

478
00:28:30,381 --> 00:28:32,381
This is The General.

479
00:28:32,468 --> 00:28:35,519
Millie, I almost forgot.
I've already seen this picture.

480
00:28:35,555 --> 00:28:37,555
I saw it once downtown at the Palace.

481
00:28:37,605 --> 00:28:38,440
But you said...

482
00:28:39,146 --> 00:28:41,146
Oh, I got it.

483
00:28:41,425 --> 00:28:43,603
You wouldn't mind
if I went alone, would you?

484
00:28:43,808 --> 00:28:44,712
No, I wouldn't mind.

485
00:28:44,909 --> 00:28:46,119
I didn't think so.

486
00:28:46,287 --> 00:28:47,680
Goodbye then.
-Goodbye.

487
00:28:49,316 --> 00:28:51,574
Gee, Dan, this is like old times.

488
00:28:51,816 --> 00:28:52,497
Yeah.

489
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,116
Let's go on the rollercoaster

490
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,621
 and the chute and the dipper.
Let's go on everything.

491
00:28:57,557 --> 00:28:58,463
All right.

492
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:07,938
<i>My knees were really shaking
back there. I thought the cops

493
00:29:07,988 --> 00:29:09,310
<i>would bust out of that alley any minute.

494
00:29:09,765 --> 00:29:11,765
<i>Now I'm in..Now I'm in the clear.

495
00:29:11,889 --> 00:29:14,584
<i>With heavy dough in my pocket
I can pay off that jewelry store

496
00:29:14,616 --> 00:29:15,479
<i>and have enough left over to

497
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:17,529
<i>show Vera the biggest time she ever had.

498
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:19,161
<i>Vera!

499
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:21,292
<i>I've got a date with her tonight.

500
00:29:21,514 --> 00:29:23,792
<i>I promised to meet her at Nick's place.

501
00:29:31,443 --> 00:29:32,498
What time is it?

502
00:29:32,998 --> 00:29:34,998
It's twenty five to ten.

503
00:29:35,498 --> 00:29:38,210
Holy smoke! I promised
to meet a guy a half hour ago.

504
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,710
I'm kind of late.
I'm sorry, kid. Could I...

505
00:29:41,122 --> 00:29:42,559
Can I walk you to the bus or something?

506
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:44,519
You don't have to, Danny.

507
00:29:44,613 --> 00:29:46,163
I can get home by myself.

508
00:29:46,264 --> 00:29:50,243
I'll give you a ring and we'll
get together some time soon.

509
00:29:50,293 --> 00:29:51,457
I'll see you later.

510
00:29:59,775 --> 00:30:00,883
And don't come back.

511
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:02,630
I want my fifty dollars.

512
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,774
Do me a favor, will you? Drop dead.

513
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:11,851
Take your hands off her.

514
00:30:11,901 --> 00:30:13,901
Did you hear me?

515
00:30:15,094 --> 00:30:17,094
I don't like to be pushed around.

516
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,415
I just don't like...

517
00:30:33,572 --> 00:30:35,365
What's all this about fifty dollars?

518
00:30:35,865 --> 00:30:37,651
It wasn't a loan. It was a present.

519
00:30:39,235 --> 00:30:41,822
I don't want you taking fifty dollars
from a guy like this ever.

520
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:44,204
Let's get out of here.

521
00:31:25,368 --> 00:31:27,368
Waiter, waiter. Two more of these.

522
00:31:29,903 --> 00:31:31,903
When are you going to tell me
what we're celebrating?

523
00:31:32,315 --> 00:31:33,674
Are we supposed to be
celebrating something?

524
00:31:33,783 --> 00:31:34,903
There has to be.

525
00:31:35,256 --> 00:31:38,250
Last night you were spending dollar
bills and tonight it's fifties.

526
00:31:39,546 --> 00:31:41,170
I won at the crap game.

527
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:44,577
Sure it wasn't bingo?

528
00:31:44,775 --> 00:31:46,206
Two champagne cocktails.

529
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,100
What do you mean, bingo?

530
00:31:50,902 --> 00:31:52,902
Just thought you might have
won it from Shorty McCabe.

531
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:57,761
What gave you that idea?

532
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,032
Maybe it was Evelyn?

533
00:32:01,657 --> 00:32:02,687
Evelyn? Who's Evelyn?

534
00:32:04,225 --> 00:32:05,511
Bookkeeper in the movie house.

535
00:32:07,368 --> 00:32:09,368
She saw Shorty lose it in the auto park.

536
00:32:11,356 --> 00:32:12,598
What do you know about this?

537
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,889
She just came into Nick's place
to phone the cops.

538
00:32:16,932 --> 00:32:17,747
Cops?

539
00:32:17,797 --> 00:32:18,643
What did she say?

540
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,487
Vera! Long time, no see.

541
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,056
How about a dance?
-No thanks.

542
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,106
Your boyfriend won't mind.
-No thanks.

543
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,540
Can I buy you both a drink?
-No.

544
00:32:26,622 --> 00:32:29,040
Isn't there anything I can do for you?
-Yeah, blow.

545
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,517
You heard her.

546
00:32:35,633 --> 00:32:36,990
What did she say?

547
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:43,381
She said she saw the guy who did it
with a handkerchief around his face.

548
00:32:46,352 --> 00:32:47,946
He took Shorty for his bankroll.

549
00:32:50,487 --> 00:32:51,523
Didn't he?

550
00:32:54,182 --> 00:32:55,269
How do I know?

551
00:32:56,726 --> 00:32:58,211
Just thought you might have
heard about it.

552
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,083
Anyhow, if it was me,

553
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:04,583
and I'd won any fifty dollar bills,

554
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:07,533
I wouldn't go spending them
around the pier.

555
00:33:07,805 --> 00:33:08,429
Yeah?

556
00:33:08,929 --> 00:33:09,657
Why not?

557
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:13,531
Because everyone around knows that
Shorty carries fifties.

558
00:33:19,871 --> 00:33:21,348
I don't know any guy named Shorty.

559
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,580
I won this dough in a crap game, see?

560
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,704
Sure, you did. Sure, you did.

561
00:33:26,696 --> 00:33:28,079
Let's dance a little, huh?

562
00:33:30,126 --> 00:33:31,759
That's more like it.

563
00:33:32,865 --> 00:33:34,112
Only...

564
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,190
We won't spend the fifties.

565
00:33:38,255 --> 00:33:38,808
Will we?

566
00:33:42,309 --> 00:33:43,150
No.

567
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:47,169
No, we won't spend the fifties.

568
00:33:57,188 --> 00:33:58,784
Here's a hundred dollars.

569
00:33:58,871 --> 00:33:59,690
There's your dough.

570
00:34:01,617 --> 00:34:02,721
There's your contract.

571
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:04,656
So long, Brady.

572
00:34:04,854 --> 00:34:05,682
So long.

573
00:34:12,933 --> 00:34:13,883
Mackey Motor.

574
00:34:15,224 --> 00:34:15,810
Who?

575
00:34:17,033 --> 00:34:18,029
This is him speaking.

576
00:34:20,863 --> 00:34:21,864
How would I like to what?

577
00:34:23,913 --> 00:34:25,839
How would you like to take a big jump
off the pier?

578
00:34:26,037 --> 00:34:28,303
I don't like to take a jump
off the pier.

579
00:34:29,422 --> 00:34:31,223
But you better come and see me or else.

580
00:34:31,325 --> 00:34:32,295
Or else what?

581
00:34:32,921 --> 00:34:34,795
Or else something is going to happen

582
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,190
To you.

583
00:34:37,014 --> 00:34:38,246
To you, Danny boy.

584
00:35:04,889 --> 00:35:06,513
What's on your mind?
And it better be good.

585
00:35:06,674 --> 00:35:07,949
Oh, it's very good.

586
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,706
You know, last night the prize fighter,

587
00:35:10,756 --> 00:35:13,572
 the big prize fighter left something
here. I picked it up.

588
00:35:13,993 --> 00:35:15,412
Picked it up where you left it.

589
00:35:15,912 --> 00:35:16,863
It's got a knot in it.

590
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,120
You know, like you use for a mask.

591
00:35:20,361 --> 00:35:21,612
I don't know what you're talking about.

592
00:35:21,654 --> 00:35:22,157
No?

593
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:24,207
No, but I'll take it just for luck.

594
00:35:24,412 --> 00:35:26,575
Sure, you keep my handkerchief.

595
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,336
But I...I keep your handkerchief.

596
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:29,764
Same knot only...

597
00:35:30,264 --> 00:35:32,264
Only your handkerchief got blood on it.

598
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:33,615
So what?

599
00:35:35,022 --> 00:35:37,022
Did you ever hear anybody say,
"money talks"?

600
00:35:38,453 --> 00:35:39,736
Fifty dollar bills.

601
00:35:40,066 --> 00:35:41,193
They talk very loud.

602
00:35:41,693 --> 00:35:42,462
Big bills.

603
00:35:42,962 --> 00:35:44,157
What do they say?

604
00:35:45,055 --> 00:35:47,055
They say,
"Shorty McCabe, Shorty McCabe."

605
00:35:47,695 --> 00:35:50,085
Yeah, that's what it says,
"Shorty McCabe."

606
00:35:50,209 --> 00:35:51,860
What's your angle?
What are you trying to tell me?

607
00:35:52,552 --> 00:35:54,218
I'm telling you about a holdup.

608
00:35:55,212 --> 00:35:57,426
See, Evelyn from the picture show she...

609
00:35:58,316 --> 00:35:59,926
She saw the man get robbed.

610
00:36:00,169 --> 00:36:02,795
She got a very good look
at the guy who did it.

611
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:05,597
She thinks she can identify him
very easy.

612
00:36:06,046 --> 00:36:07,638
Nice girl. You want me to call her?

613
00:36:07,688 --> 00:36:09,126
Wait a minute. Put it down.

614
00:36:11,189 --> 00:36:13,724
If you're so sure I'm mixed up in this
thing, why don't you call the cops?

615
00:36:14,011 --> 00:36:14,723
Cops?

616
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:17,474
I'm a businessman.

617
00:36:17,804 --> 00:36:19,101
See, Danny boy I...

618
00:36:19,439 --> 00:36:21,895
I think I can do business
with you very nice.

619
00:36:22,299 --> 00:36:24,056
What kind of business do you think
you can do with me?

620
00:36:24,209 --> 00:36:25,323
Automobile business.

621
00:36:26,066 --> 00:36:27,547
You get me a new car and

622
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:29,218
And I don't know nothing.

623
00:36:29,526 --> 00:36:30,158
Just nothing.

624
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:32,820
A new car?

625
00:36:34,913 --> 00:36:36,677
I couldn't get a new car if I wanted to.

626
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:38,239
You can get a new car.

627
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:40,127
The same way you got
the fifty dollar bill.

628
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:42,708
Are you nuts?

629
00:36:42,987 --> 00:36:43,521
Nuts?

630
00:36:45,658 --> 00:36:47,658
No, I don't think so.

631
00:36:51,185 --> 00:36:52,179
Davis.

632
00:36:52,473 --> 00:36:53,205
Yes.

633
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:56,479
Here are the plates for the green sedan.

634
00:36:56,979 --> 00:36:59,134
See that it's ready for delivery
in the morning.

635
00:36:59,722 --> 00:37:00,352
Yeah.

636
00:37:00,904 --> 00:37:02,012
Oh, and Davis.

637
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:05,705
Don't let me catch you putting in
ten gallons of gas this time.

638
00:37:06,397 --> 00:37:07,498
Six is plenty.

639
00:37:08,175 --> 00:37:09,371
Yes, sir.

640
00:37:11,486 --> 00:37:14,010
<i>There goes the last new car
we'll have this month.

641
00:37:14,871 --> 00:37:17,011
<i>I've got to get it tonight
or blow town tomorrow.

642
00:37:17,511 --> 00:37:19,770
<i>Even if I blow town, they'll probably
catch up with me.

643
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:22,270
<i>Oh boy, am I in a mess.

644
00:37:24,447 --> 00:37:25,197
Hey, Dan.

645
00:37:25,255 --> 00:37:26,288
Dan, I uh...

646
00:37:26,788 --> 00:37:27,979
I was just thinking that if

647
00:37:28,206 --> 00:37:29,859
you're not planning on
taking Helen out anymore

648
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,165
I thought maybe I'd

649
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:32,250
give her a call sometime.

650
00:37:33,414 --> 00:37:34,275
Yeah, sure.

651
00:37:34,657 --> 00:37:35,696
Why don't you do that, Chuck?

652
00:38:39,924 --> 00:38:41,072
Hey uh...

653
00:38:41,343 --> 00:38:42,199
Hey, fella.

654
00:38:43,526 --> 00:38:44,699
This thing is stuck back here.

655
00:38:46,762 --> 00:38:48,030
Let's see what it is.

656
00:38:51,819 --> 00:38:55,240
It's the green sedan. The second on
California St. It's got license plates.

657
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:57,334
That's fine.

658
00:38:57,576 --> 00:38:59,576
Like I promised you, I know nothing.

659
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:00,990
Absolutely nothing.

660
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:03,226
What's the matter?
-I want the handkerchief.

661
00:39:03,335 --> 00:39:04,035
Here.

662
00:39:07,374 --> 00:39:10,284
You let go of this and..
-You let go and I'll let go.

663
00:39:11,551 --> 00:39:12,651
What are you going to do with the car?

664
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:15,151
That's none of your business, Danny boy.

665
00:39:16,277 --> 00:39:17,437
I'll tell you. I'm...

666
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:19,767
I sold it to a gambler friend
of mine. He's...

667
00:39:20,016 --> 00:39:22,016
he's driving it home to Nevada.

668
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:25,048
See that he does. I don't want it around
town. It's liable to get me in a jam.

669
00:39:25,172 --> 00:39:26,730
Don't worry. He's going home tonight.

670
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,330
No slip-ups.

671
00:39:27,395 --> 00:39:29,395
OK

672
00:39:54,995 --> 00:39:55,584
Brady.

673
00:39:56,158 --> 00:39:56,898
Yeah?

674
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:01,106
Now I know who took that green sedan.

675
00:40:02,972 --> 00:40:03,606
You

676
00:40:04,784 --> 00:40:05,475
do?

677
00:40:05,879 --> 00:40:06,506
Yeah.

678
00:40:06,734 --> 00:40:09,006
I could tell the police about it
right this minute.

679
00:40:09,233 --> 00:40:11,784
But I don't know if that would help me
get back the car or not.

680
00:40:12,092 --> 00:40:13,145
You understand?

681
00:40:14,626 --> 00:40:15,645
No I uh...

682
00:40:16,573 --> 00:40:17,393
I don't.

683
00:40:17,443 --> 00:40:20,358
I'm not interested in sending anybody
to jail, Brady.

684
00:40:20,682 --> 00:40:23,079
I'm interested in getting back that car.

685
00:40:25,947 --> 00:40:28,199
I don't know why you're telling me
all this.

686
00:40:28,249 --> 00:40:29,835
Oh, yes you do.

687
00:40:30,335 --> 00:40:32,928
An employee of this firm
stole that sedan.

688
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,882
And I happen to know who it is
because he was seen.

689
00:40:38,265 --> 00:40:40,706
If you're trying to pin this thing
on me, Mr. Brady...

690
00:40:40,756 --> 00:40:42,157
Don't try to run any bluffs.

691
00:40:42,184 --> 00:40:43,297
How many times do I have to tell you...

692
00:40:43,317 --> 00:40:44,792
You don't have to tell me anything.

693
00:40:44,824 --> 00:40:47,141
All you have to do is get that car
down here

694
00:40:47,191 --> 00:40:49,574
parked out in front before
I get down tomorrow.

695
00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:53,802
What if I haven't got it?
What if I don't know where it is?

696
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,788
But you did have it
and you do know where it is.

697
00:40:55,838 --> 00:40:56,852
Well, I don't anymore.

698
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:03,633
If you can't return the car,
you'll have to pay for it.

699
00:41:03,963 --> 00:41:05,503
Three thousand dollars.

700
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,892
Three thousand dollars.

701
00:41:08,436 --> 00:41:09,088
Why...

702
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:11,284
It only lists for nineteen fifty.

703
00:41:11,334 --> 00:41:13,097
You don't think I'd sell to you at list?

704
00:41:13,531 --> 00:41:16,162
Three thousand dollars. Where would a
guy like me get any dough like that?

705
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:18,615
Everybody's got a family someplace.

706
00:41:18,665 --> 00:41:21,695
Most folks would go to a lot of trouble
to keep a man out of jail.

707
00:41:21,767 --> 00:41:22,579
Not mine.

708
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:26,195
Now look, I'll give you 24 hours, Brady.

709
00:41:26,769 --> 00:41:29,814
I want the money
or I want the automobile.

710
00:41:30,012 --> 00:41:31,554
Now let me give you some warning.

711
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,421
Don't you try to leave town.

712
00:41:47,066 --> 00:41:48,531
<i>Three thousand dollars.

713
00:41:48,832 --> 00:41:50,343
<i>It might as well be three million.

714
00:41:51,027 --> 00:41:53,286
<i>I tried to remember who could have seen
me in the green sedan.

715
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,241
<i>Nobody would have known I had it
except Nick.

716
00:41:56,029 --> 00:41:56,701
<i>Nick!

717
00:41:57,275 --> 00:41:58,846
<i>Maybe that was who told the old man.

718
00:41:58,896 --> 00:41:59,993
<i>Nick hated me.

719
00:42:00,058 --> 00:42:02,058
<i>He'd cut my throat for a nickel.

720
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:07,618
What's the matter with you tonight?

721
00:42:08,184 --> 00:42:10,184
You look like you lost your last friend.

722
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,459
How would you like to go to Texas
right now, honey, right away?

723
00:42:13,723 --> 00:42:14,789
Are you kidding?

724
00:42:14,942 --> 00:42:15,737
I'm on the level.

725
00:42:18,618 --> 00:42:20,029
What's the matter with California?

726
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,529
Weather getting too warm?

727
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:28,086
I'll tell you about it later.

728
00:42:30,802 --> 00:42:32,537
So, I'm in a worse jam than ever.

729
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:36,381
My boss is going to throw me in the brig
if I don't get  three thousand bucks.

730
00:42:36,431 --> 00:42:37,303
Or else.

731
00:42:37,737 --> 00:42:39,737
Where am I going to get a hold of
three thousand bucks?

732
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:44,746
I know where there's three
or four thousand dollars.

733
00:42:45,799 --> 00:42:47,614
Yeah, the First National Bank.

734
00:42:48,062 --> 00:42:49,375
No, not in any bank.

735
00:42:49,794 --> 00:42:51,794
Where we can get at it.
We can get at it easy.

736
00:42:52,773 --> 00:42:56,446
All you have to do is break a little
catch lock on a rickety old door.

737
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,946
You could pry it open
with your fingernails.

738
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,281
Not with my fingernails.

739
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:02,598
I'm in too deep already.

740
00:43:13,608 --> 00:43:14,773
This is the end of the month.

741
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,273
That's when Nick keeps
the money over night.

742
00:43:17,626 --> 00:43:18,164
Nick.

743
00:43:18,878 --> 00:43:20,075
You mean Nick at the penny arcade?

744
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:20,668
Uh huh.

745
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,876
There'd be thousands
of dollars there tonight.

746
00:43:25,976 --> 00:43:27,682
What would Nick be doing
with that kind of dough?

747
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,322
He charges people for cashing checks.

748
00:43:31,294 --> 00:43:32,379
Today's a big payday.

749
00:43:32,835 --> 00:43:35,418
A lot of them will bring their checks
in the morning before the banks open.

750
00:43:36,795 --> 00:43:38,596
And he doesn't even have a safe.

751
00:43:39,096 --> 00:43:39,929
He hides it.

752
00:43:42,383 --> 00:43:43,471
I know where.

753
00:43:47,669 --> 00:43:49,031
It was Nick who got me into all this.

754
00:43:49,221 --> 00:43:50,674
Let Nick get you out.

755
00:43:51,903 --> 00:43:53,410
Then you won't have to go to Texas.

756
00:43:54,603 --> 00:43:56,603
You can stay here with me.

757
00:43:57,929 --> 00:43:58,659
Wait a minute.

758
00:43:58,953 --> 00:43:59,507
What's the matter?

759
00:44:01,563 --> 00:44:03,089
There's someone watching us
from the house.

760
00:44:09,216 --> 00:44:10,321
It's only old snoop.

761
00:44:10,688 --> 00:44:11,137
Who?

762
00:44:11,187 --> 00:44:12,029
The landlady.

763
00:44:12,964 --> 00:44:14,217
She's always looking for trouble.

764
00:44:14,671 --> 00:44:16,117
They had a news program on the air

765
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:19,091
the other night and she tried to tell me
I had a man in my room.

766
00:44:21,741 --> 00:44:22,765
She's still watching.

767
00:44:25,433 --> 00:44:27,433
Let's give her something to watch.

768
00:44:33,367 --> 00:44:34,778
I'll stay out here and look out
for the watchman.

769
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:37,470
If I see him coming, I'll honk the horn.

770
00:44:37,963 --> 00:44:39,704
Blow it three times so I know it's you.

771
00:44:39,754 --> 00:44:40,427
All right.

772
00:44:41,782 --> 00:44:42,493
Good luck.

773
00:46:48,707 --> 00:46:50,707
Stop or I'll shoot!

774
00:48:30,743 --> 00:48:31,637
Move over, will you?

775
00:48:31,687 --> 00:48:33,124
Let's get out of here quick.

776
00:48:44,775 --> 00:48:45,677
Did you get the money?
-Yeah.

777
00:48:45,867 --> 00:48:47,867
I heard shooting. What happened?
The night watchman saw me.

778
00:48:49,045 --> 00:48:51,045
You took a big chance tonight
and you got away with it.

779
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:53,219
You ought to be tickled to death.

780
00:48:53,343 --> 00:48:54,120
Well, I'm not.

781
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,349
I feel like I'm being shoved
into a corner

782
00:48:56,399 --> 00:48:58,058
and if I don't get out soon,
it'll be too late.

783
00:48:58,393 --> 00:48:59,475
Maybe it's too late already.

784
00:48:59,525 --> 00:49:00,605
Well, you can stop worrying.

785
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:03,960
You're out right now. You've got money
in your pocket to pay your way out.

786
00:49:04,084 --> 00:49:06,084
Yeah, that's right. I've got the money.

787
00:49:06,584 --> 00:49:07,483
It'll square everything.

788
00:49:08,935 --> 00:49:10,027
I wonder how much there is.

789
00:49:10,771 --> 00:49:11,619
It feels like a lot.

790
00:49:13,049 --> 00:49:14,694
Let's take it to my room and count it.

791
00:49:15,607 --> 00:49:17,023
All right.

792
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:34,976
Pull down the shades.

793
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:46,922
Five hundred in each package.

794
00:49:47,134 --> 00:49:49,134
Two, three, four...

795
00:49:49,634 --> 00:49:51,048
Five, six, seven!

796
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:53,127
There's thirty-five hundred dollars.

797
00:49:55,508 --> 00:49:56,113
Twenty...

798
00:49:56,613 --> 00:49:58,613
Forty, sixty, eighty...

799
00:49:58,825 --> 00:50:00,230
Ninety, a hundred...

800
00:50:00,936 --> 00:50:01,877
A hundred and ten...

801
00:50:03,406 --> 00:50:04,945
There's thirty-six hundred
and ten dollars.

802
00:50:05,895 --> 00:50:06,704
That's a lot of dough.

803
00:50:07,735 --> 00:50:10,081
More money than I could make
in a year working every day.

804
00:50:12,329 --> 00:50:12,979
It's the coppers.

805
00:50:16,702 --> 00:50:18,249
Just like I thought.

806
00:50:18,292 --> 00:50:20,292
What's the big idea?
Who said you can come in?

807
00:50:20,342 --> 00:50:23,437
I have rules in this house.
This is a clean respectable place.

808
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:25,994
Well, you got no right in here.
Now get out.

809
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:27,823
I don't allow no men in the rooms.

810
00:50:27,873 --> 00:50:29,106
Not in my house.

811
00:50:29,606 --> 00:50:32,354
And I'm not leaving until he goes.

812
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:36,808
You're leaving right now.

813
00:50:37,065 --> 00:50:38,682
Maybe you'd rather I call the cops?

814
00:50:38,714 --> 00:50:39,594
Why, you old...

815
00:50:39,644 --> 00:50:40,976
Battle-axe!
-Cut it out, will you?

816
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:43,801
We don't want any trouble,
especially now. Maybe I ought to go.

817
00:50:45,769 --> 00:50:46,832
You think you can...

818
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:48,362
Take care of everything all right?

819
00:50:48,493 --> 00:50:49,055
Oh.

820
00:50:50,272 --> 00:50:51,717
Yeah, sure, Danny. Don't worry.

821
00:50:52,942 --> 00:50:54,217
I can take care of everything.

822
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:56,603
I'll call you in the morning.

823
00:51:02,217 --> 00:51:04,729
I don't want any of your kind
around here.

824
00:51:04,919 --> 00:51:07,473
When your rent's up, you can move out.

825
00:51:07,767 --> 00:51:08,948
Scram!

826
00:51:11,262 --> 00:51:13,262
Hello, is Vera Novak there?
-Hey.

827
00:51:13,301 --> 00:51:14,496
You're going to wear
that thing out today.

828
00:51:14,546 --> 00:51:15,242
This is...

829
00:51:15,348 --> 00:51:17,348
Why don't you forget about her.
She's just another dame.

830
00:51:17,457 --> 00:51:19,457
Will you sh...do me a favor
and shut up please.

831
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:20,609
Sorry.

832
00:51:20,659 --> 00:51:22,266
This is her day off.
She wouldn't be at the restaurant.

833
00:51:23,252 --> 00:51:25,803
When she comes in, would you tell her
to call Dan Brady at Mackey Motor?

834
00:51:25,853 --> 00:51:28,117
 It's very important.
As soon as she comes in.

835
00:51:32,937 --> 00:51:34,275
Well, Brady?
-Well?

836
00:51:34,598 --> 00:51:37,335
I didn't see that green sedan
when I came down this morning.

837
00:51:37,724 --> 00:51:38,759
No, you didn't, did you?

838
00:51:39,023 --> 00:51:40,476
That mean you can't get it back?

839
00:51:40,777 --> 00:51:41,912
It can mean anything you want it to.

840
00:51:42,368 --> 00:51:44,989
Well, then I assume you intend
to pay for the car instead.

841
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:45,615
Oh, do you?

842
00:51:46,012 --> 00:51:47,828
How long will it take you
to get the money?

843
00:51:49,377 --> 00:51:50,328
I've got it already.

844
00:51:52,171 --> 00:51:54,270
Fine, why don't you come
right in the office?

845
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,217
I haven't got it on me.

846
00:51:56,277 --> 00:51:57,725
I have to pick it up tonight after work.

847
00:51:57,886 --> 00:51:59,886
I'll bring it in the morning.
-Why wait till tomorrow?

848
00:52:00,386 --> 00:52:03,749
I'll come back after dinner tonight.
You can see me in the office then.

849
00:52:06,565 --> 00:52:08,381
It might be ten o'clock or so.

850
00:52:08,711 --> 00:52:09,720
That's all right.

851
00:52:10,589 --> 00:52:11,997
That's perfectly all right.

852
00:52:12,283 --> 00:52:13,258
See you tonight.

853
00:52:17,409 --> 00:52:18,414
Mackey Motor.

854
00:52:19,054 --> 00:52:20,706
Hello, Vera. Where have you been?

855
00:52:23,213 --> 00:52:24,784
Did you take care of everything
all right?

856
00:52:27,104 --> 00:52:27,734
Good.

857
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,234
That's swell, baby. Look I'll...

858
00:52:30,904 --> 00:52:33,438
I'll be over and see you right after
I get off work. Right after six o'clock.

859
00:52:34,897 --> 00:52:35,409
Goodbye.

860
00:52:50,821 --> 00:52:52,095
Is that you, Danny?
-Yeah.

861
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,386
Come right in.

862
00:53:03,171 --> 00:53:04,182
Isn't it beautiful, Danny?

863
00:53:06,091 --> 00:53:08,091
Oh, Danny, Danny.

864
00:53:08,281 --> 00:53:10,644
I might never have had it
if it hadn't been for you.

865
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:11,689
Where did you get the coat?

866
00:53:11,747 --> 00:53:12,462
I bought it.

867
00:53:12,549 --> 00:53:13,468
Bought it with what?

868
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,100
With my share of the money.

869
00:53:16,942 --> 00:53:17,969
Here's your end.

870
00:53:18,469 --> 00:53:20,025
Eighteen hundred dollars.

871
00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:22,308
You took half the dough
and bought a coat with it?

872
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:24,498
Not just a coat, Danny. A mink coat.

873
00:53:24,755 --> 00:53:25,788
You sold me out.

874
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:27,353
Now, just a minute.

875
00:53:27,706 --> 00:53:29,706
Who told you where the money was?
Who told you how to get it?

876
00:53:30,169 --> 00:53:31,034
Isn't that worth half?

877
00:53:31,073 --> 00:53:32,658
I can't use half. I need three thousand.

878
00:53:32,708 --> 00:53:33,902
Don't be a chump.

879
00:53:34,258 --> 00:53:36,258
Nobody expects to get everything
they ask for.

880
00:53:36,397 --> 00:53:38,026
Make him an offer. That's what I did.

881
00:53:38,179 --> 00:53:38,983
What you did.

882
00:53:39,792 --> 00:53:41,483
This coat cost two thousand dollars.

883
00:53:41,961 --> 00:53:44,013
I told the furrier eighteen hundred
was all I had.

884
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,857
Take it or leave it.

885
00:53:45,571 --> 00:53:46,271
He took it.

886
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:49,038
Offer this to the old man.

887
00:53:49,538 --> 00:53:50,682
Tell him it's all you could raise.

888
00:53:51,182 --> 00:53:52,360
I bet anything he takes it.

889
00:54:28,915 --> 00:54:32,537
Well, Brady, I'm glad you're doing
the sensible thing.

890
00:54:39,947 --> 00:54:42,073
There's only eighteen hundred here.
-That's right.

891
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:43,119
Where's the rest of it?

892
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:44,899
I couldn't dig it up.

893
00:54:45,399 --> 00:54:46,297
Take it or leave it.

894
00:54:48,646 --> 00:54:49,601
I'll take it.

895
00:55:00,033 --> 00:55:00,671
<i>Operator.

896
00:55:00,876 --> 00:55:02,104
Get me the police station.

897
00:55:02,582 --> 00:55:03,619
What's the idea?

898
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:05,592
I told you I'd forget about the whole

899
00:55:05,642 --> 00:55:09,086
thing for three thousand dollars
but not for eighteen hundred.

900
00:55:09,753 --> 00:55:11,164
If you've got the rest of it on you,

901
00:55:11,214 --> 00:55:13,467
you'd better pay me now
before it's too late.

902
00:56:49,719 --> 00:56:51,498
Dan? Hey, Danny boy.

903
00:56:51,688 --> 00:56:53,064
Hi Chuck. Hi Helen.

904
00:56:53,306 --> 00:56:55,462
Hey, Danny, I missed you
at quitting time tonight. I...

905
00:56:55,542 --> 00:56:56,495
I want to say goodbye.

906
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:57,873
Goodbye?

907
00:56:57,938 --> 00:56:58,996
Yeah, I quit today.

908
00:56:59,201 --> 00:57:00,685
I'm through with that screwball, Mackey.

909
00:57:00,721 --> 00:57:02,343
I told you what he tried to pull on me,
didn't I?

910
00:57:02,386 --> 00:57:03,152
No. No, you didn't.

911
00:57:03,202 --> 00:57:05,062
Remember the night
the sedan disappeared?

912
00:57:05,311 --> 00:57:08,333
The next morning he called me in his
office and tried to tell me I swiped it.

913
00:57:09,187 --> 00:57:09,848
He said what?

914
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,060
Like I'm telling you.
He said I stole the car.

915
00:57:12,236 --> 00:57:14,850
Gave me a lot of hooey about
somebody seeing me drive away.

916
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:17,297
Wait a minute. I'm all mixed up.
Let me get this thing straight.

917
00:57:17,344 --> 00:57:18,908
He said that he saw you
drive that car away?

918
00:57:18,958 --> 00:57:19,803
That ain't all.

919
00:57:19,835 --> 00:57:21,182
Yesterday he called me in his office

920
00:57:21,207 --> 00:57:23,396
and he had the screwy idea
 I should get three thousand bucks

921
00:57:23,446 --> 00:57:24,986
from my old man to pay for the sedan.

922
00:57:25,085 --> 00:57:26,467
Now how nuts can a guy get?

923
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,314
He didn't know anything at all.
Just fishing around.

924
00:57:28,364 --> 00:57:30,364
Putting the pressure on everybody
hoping something would turn up.

925
00:57:30,776 --> 00:57:32,776
I should have let him have one
talking to me like that.

926
00:57:33,025 --> 00:57:35,349
Some of these days that old man
is gonna get his neck in a sling.

927
00:57:37,641 --> 00:57:38,664
Neck in a sling?

928
00:57:41,369 --> 00:57:42,225
Yeah.

929
00:57:42,777 --> 00:57:44,042
He had it coming, didn't he?

930
00:57:44,542 --> 00:57:46,542
Always trying to outsmart everybody
but he got too smart.

931
00:57:48,592 --> 00:57:50,172
He got so smart,
he got his neck in a sling.

932
00:57:55,611 --> 00:57:57,059
Danny, what is it? What's the matter?

933
00:58:02,058 --> 00:58:04,058
I uh...I have a date here.

934
00:58:04,558 --> 00:58:05,649
I'm late already.

935
00:58:15,596 --> 00:58:16,294
Come in.

936
00:58:17,863 --> 00:58:19,133
How did it go?

937
00:58:19,248 --> 00:58:19,947
Did he take the money?

938
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:21,335
Yeah, he took it.

939
00:58:21,367 --> 00:58:22,173
I told you he would.

940
00:58:22,223 --> 00:58:23,488
Pack your things.
We gotta get out of here.

941
00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:24,835
What are you talking about?

942
00:58:24,885 --> 00:58:26,387
He tried to call the cops.
I had to stop him.

943
00:58:26,791 --> 00:58:27,496
Stop him?

944
00:58:29,021 --> 00:58:29,573
How?

945
00:58:29,623 --> 00:58:30,796
Never mind. Pack your things.

946
00:58:31,024 --> 00:58:32,862
Stop clowning, Danny. How?
-I'm not clowning.

947
00:58:32,904 --> 00:58:33,757
He tried to call the cops.

948
00:58:33,807 --> 00:58:34,957
I had to take the phone away from him.

949
00:58:35,449 --> 00:58:36,431
He pulled a gun on me. I...

950
00:58:37,248 --> 00:58:38,075
I strangled him.

951
00:58:38,678 --> 00:58:40,019
On the level?
-On the level.

952
00:58:40,488 --> 00:58:41,955
But they won't find him
till in the morning.

953
00:58:42,005 --> 00:58:43,131
By that time, we'll be halfway to Texas.

954
00:58:43,734 --> 00:58:45,010
You'll be halfway to Texas.

955
00:58:45,415 --> 00:58:46,058
Not me.

956
00:58:46,108 --> 00:58:47,480
But the cops will be after us.

957
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:49,018
They won't be after me.

958
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:50,406
I don't have to run away.

959
00:58:50,913 --> 00:58:53,091
Look, we're in this thing together.
You told me to offer him the dough.

960
00:58:53,141 --> 00:58:54,369
I didn't tell you to kill him.

961
00:58:54,994 --> 00:58:56,255
And I wasn't there when it happened.

962
00:58:57,147 --> 00:58:58,785
So why should I stick my neck out now?

963
00:58:58,824 --> 00:59:00,241
What kind of a dame are you?

964
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:01,774
The kind that watches out for herself.

965
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:04,108
If I didn't who would?

966
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,220
You don't care about
anybody else, do you?

967
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,720
Why, sure I do.

968
00:59:10,662 --> 00:59:13,702
I wouldn't want to see anything
happen to you, Danny.

969
00:59:14,608 --> 00:59:16,608
I certainly wouldn't want to see
the cops catch you.

970
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,470
Don't you think you better get started
to Texas?

971
00:59:21,145 --> 00:59:21,970
I'll uh...

972
00:59:22,713 --> 00:59:24,876
I'll kiss you goodbye if you want me to.

973
00:59:25,302 --> 00:59:27,074
I wouldn't dirty my lips.

974
00:59:33,738 --> 00:59:34,909
One more flight.

975
00:59:49,552 --> 00:59:50,676
Miss Novak?

976
00:59:50,756 --> 00:59:52,416
Some gentlemen to see you.

977
00:59:59,423 --> 01:00:00,462
Are you Vera Novak?

978
01:00:00,815 --> 01:00:02,022
What if I am?

979
01:00:02,522 --> 01:00:03,928
We've got something for you.

980
01:00:04,045 --> 01:00:04,746
Yeah?

981
01:00:05,312 --> 01:00:07,312
What is it?
-A search warrant.

982
01:00:11,873 --> 01:00:13,433
See what she's got
in her purse, Smitty.

983
01:00:24,147 --> 01:00:25,616
You won't find him in there.

984
01:00:26,758 --> 01:00:28,050
Won't find who in there?

985
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:30,100
You know who. Dan Brady.

986
01:00:30,453 --> 01:00:32,120
Oh, yeah. Dan Brady.

987
01:00:32,878 --> 01:00:33,861
Where will I find him?

988
01:00:34,118 --> 01:00:36,118
He's getting out of the state
as fast as he can drive.

989
01:00:36,168 --> 01:00:37,544
Why aren't you getting out too?

990
01:00:37,682 --> 01:00:39,926
I didn't have any part of it.
I didn't even know him.

991
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:40,929
Didn't know who?

992
01:00:43,523 --> 01:00:45,915
Say, you trying to make me
look like a fool?

993
01:00:46,054 --> 01:00:47,247
Mackey, of course.

994
01:00:47,703 --> 01:00:49,162
Mackey. Which Mackey is that?

995
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:50,859
The one that ran the auto agency.

996
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:52,064
Ran?

997
01:00:52,689 --> 01:00:55,464
Well, he can't keep on running it
now that he's dead, can he?

998
01:00:56,428 --> 01:00:57,277
Who's dead?

999
01:00:57,505 --> 01:00:58,498
Mackey, of course.

1000
01:00:58,548 --> 01:01:00,326
Brady killed him. The girl didn't
have any part of it.

1001
01:01:01,209 --> 01:01:02,150
Where did it happen?

1002
01:01:02,562 --> 01:01:04,562
You know where. At the auto...

1003
01:01:08,211 --> 01:01:10,211
Are you trying to kid me?
-Sure.

1004
01:01:11,766 --> 01:01:13,981
Maybe it's the other way around.
Maybe you're trying to kid me.

1005
01:01:14,533 --> 01:01:16,927
Why did you start spilling
the minute I came in the door?

1006
01:01:17,888 --> 01:01:18,881
Maybe it's because you wanted

1007
01:01:18,931 --> 01:01:20,808
me to think your boyfriend had gone
when he hadn't.

1008
01:01:25,658 --> 01:01:27,658
How do I know he isn't still here?

1009
01:01:30,804 --> 01:01:32,267
Why don't you look under the couch?

1010
01:01:32,494 --> 01:01:34,009
I don't suppose he'd be that near.

1011
01:01:38,263 --> 01:01:39,910
I didn't think he'd be that close.

1012
01:01:44,613 --> 01:01:45,323
Smitty.

1013
01:01:46,891 --> 01:01:47,565
Watch it.

1014
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,940
Where does a dame like you
get a coat like this?

1015
01:01:59,983 --> 01:02:02,984
I bought that coat with my own money.
You take your dirty hands off it.

1016
01:02:03,005 --> 01:02:03,933
Sure, you did.

1017
01:02:03,983 --> 01:02:05,895
I can prove it. I got a receipt.

1018
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:08,932
Here.

1019
01:02:11,372 --> 01:02:13,417
Alaska Furriers, 917 Main St.

1020
01:02:13,467 --> 01:02:15,931
Received of Vera Novak $1800.

1021
01:02:16,763 --> 01:02:19,022
Well, looks like Nick had
the right hunch, Smit.

1022
01:02:19,264 --> 01:02:20,036
Nick?

1023
01:02:20,425 --> 01:02:22,002
What do you suppose brought us here?

1024
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:24,563
Last night somebody stole
$3600 of Nick's money

1025
01:02:24,613 --> 01:02:26,947
and today you paid $1800 for a fur coat.

1026
01:02:27,203 --> 01:02:29,299
Looks like you and your boyfriend
split Nick's bankroll

1027
01:02:29,331 --> 01:02:30,018
right down the middle.

1028
01:02:30,066 --> 01:02:31,519
I don't know what you're talking about.

1029
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:32,781
Give me back my coat.

1030
01:02:32,831 --> 01:02:35,030
Don't worry about your coat, sister.
We'll take it right with us.

1031
01:02:35,097 --> 01:02:37,911
Bring her along, Smitty. We'll check on
Mackey on the way out to the station.

1032
01:02:40,564 --> 01:02:41,938
Serves you right, you hussy.

1033
01:02:42,032 --> 01:02:43,201
Drop dead.

1034
01:03:10,582 --> 01:03:11,553
What are you doing here?

1035
01:03:11,581 --> 01:03:14,149
I could see you were in trouble so I
got rid of Chuck and came back.

1036
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:15,853
Go on back home.
I've got to get out of here quick.

1037
01:03:15,903 --> 01:03:16,611
What is it, Danny?

1038
01:03:17,488 --> 01:03:18,728
Was it the holdup in the auto park?

1039
01:03:18,822 --> 01:03:19,848
What do you know about that holdup?

1040
01:03:20,134 --> 01:03:21,748
I saw you hiding
in the alley that night.

1041
01:03:22,093 --> 01:03:23,811
The night Millie and I walked by.

1042
01:03:23,905 --> 01:03:25,905
I couldn't see your features
but I knew it was you.

1043
01:03:26,847 --> 01:03:28,433
But then I thought maybe
I was imagining things

1044
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:29,689
You know how it is when

1045
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:32,604
you love someone. You think you see them
fifty times a day.

1046
01:03:32,818 --> 01:03:35,120
A minute later you called my name
and I turned around.

1047
01:03:35,237 --> 01:03:36,612
There you were in the alley.

1048
01:03:37,721 --> 01:03:39,112
Then we heard about the holdup.

1049
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:40,398
At the auto park.

1050
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:41,790
I saw the look on your face.

1051
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:42,527
Is that all?

1052
01:03:43,169 --> 01:03:43,824
That's all.

1053
01:03:43,874 --> 01:03:45,362
Well, why don't you get out
and let me get started?

1054
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:47,930
I saw the police come out of the house
with her.

1055
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:48,821
Are they after you too?

1056
01:03:48,846 --> 01:03:50,644
What if they are?
What business is it of yours?

1057
01:03:50,688 --> 01:03:51,655
But I can help you.

1058
01:03:51,688 --> 01:03:53,240
I can tell them you were with me
all evening.

1059
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:54,665
Then you'll have an alibi.

1060
01:03:54,794 --> 01:03:56,319
Why do you want to help me?

1061
01:03:56,369 --> 01:03:58,369
When things were going my way,
all I ever gave you was a runaround.

1062
01:03:58,431 --> 01:04:02,060
Now that I'm in a jam...Why don't you
get smart and stay away from me?

1063
01:04:02,114 --> 01:04:04,765
I've been away from you too long
and it isn't any good.

1064
01:04:04,855 --> 01:04:07,585
Don't you think I know I'm dumb
to throw myself at a guy that

1065
01:04:07,613 --> 01:04:09,827
doesn't want me. Don't you think
I know I'm a fool

1066
01:04:09,848 --> 01:04:11,848
to stand on a street corner
for an hour just waiting

1067
01:04:11,861 --> 01:04:13,861
for you to come
out of a door? I know all that.

1068
01:04:13,911 --> 01:04:15,006
But I can't help it.

1069
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:17,468
I fell in love with you
the first time I saw you.

1070
01:04:18,747 --> 01:04:20,747
I'll drive you home.

1071
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:27,198
<i>It's less than a week since Helen waited
for me outside the garage.

1072
01:04:27,426 --> 01:04:28,834
<i>"Have you been dancing lately?",
she said.

1073
01:04:28,884 --> 01:04:31,691
<i>And all I had to do was say, "Swell idea
let's go out dancing tonight."

1074
01:04:31,948 --> 01:04:34,864
<i>If I had said that I wouldn't be running
away from the cops tonight.

1075
01:04:35,137 --> 01:04:37,137
<i>With a murder hanging over my head.

1076
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:45,412
No, Danny, no.

1077
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:50,426
Hey, buddy, pull over to the curb.

1078
01:05:07,908 --> 01:05:09,908
I'll have to take a look
at your driver's license.

1079
01:05:13,817 --> 01:05:15,068
Brady.

1080
01:05:15,454 --> 01:05:16,850
That your name?

1081
01:05:17,058 --> 01:05:18,300
Yes, sir.

1082
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:21,181
You went through
a boulevard stop back there.

1083
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:24,192
Will you sign this?

1084
01:05:25,122 --> 01:05:26,358
Yes.

1085
01:05:31,457 --> 01:05:32,929
And take it easy.

1086
01:05:34,127 --> 01:05:35,332
Yeah.

1087
01:05:38,289 --> 01:05:40,534
Helen, you kept me
from making an awful mistake.

1088
01:05:40,588 --> 01:05:43,020
If you'll only take me with you,
I can help you. I know I can.

1089
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:44,871
Let me lay it on the line.

1090
01:05:45,485 --> 01:05:46,512
I'm going to have to keep running.

1091
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:47,763
I'm going to have to keep running
all my life.

1092
01:05:47,812 --> 01:05:49,642
Because when they catch me,
they're going to hang me.

1093
01:05:49,692 --> 01:05:50,702
Hang you?

1094
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:52,330
For murder. I...

1095
01:05:53,511 --> 01:05:55,128
I killed a man tonight.

1096
01:05:55,823 --> 01:05:57,823
Start the car
then tell me how it happened.

1097
01:06:01,972 --> 01:06:04,307
<i>Telling her about it wasn't as hard
as I thought it would be.

1098
01:06:04,539 --> 01:06:07,043
<i>It was Helen who came up with
the idea of Mexico</i>.

1099
01:06:07,295 --> 01:06:10,257
<i>We decided to head for an inland town
like Hermacio.

1100
01:06:10,297 --> 01:06:11,843
<i>Where not many tourists come</i>.

1101
01:06:11,893 --> 01:06:14,475
<i>A man could be safe for fifty years
in a place like that.

1102
01:06:16,781 --> 01:06:17,928
What's that?

1103
01:06:18,696 --> 01:06:20,696
That's goodbye to Mexico.

1104
01:06:31,739 --> 01:06:33,739
It's the main bearing.

1105
01:06:33,773 --> 01:06:35,456
It'll take a couple of days to fix.

1106
01:06:35,475 --> 01:06:36,653
Then we'll have to hitchhike.

1107
01:06:36,677 --> 01:06:38,132
And get there by morning?
 We'd never make it.

1108
01:06:38,182 --> 01:06:39,218
We have to make it.

1109
01:06:41,849 --> 01:06:44,884
Helen, I had the right girl all the time
and was too dumb to know it.

1110
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:46,552
If we ever get out of this thing...

1111
01:06:46,602 --> 01:06:47,641
We're going to get out of it.

1112
01:06:47,711 --> 01:06:49,176
Yeah, but how?

1113
01:06:49,753 --> 01:06:51,339
I've got an idea.

1114
01:06:51,371 --> 01:06:53,170
This is the baby
that's going to get us there.

1115
01:06:53,192 --> 01:06:54,563
What are you going to do with that?

1116
01:06:54,581 --> 01:06:56,890
Get us a lift, honey, a lift
straight through to Mexico.

1117
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:58,940
Come on. Careful.

1118
01:07:15,999 --> 01:07:17,032
Get in quick.

1119
01:07:17,072 --> 01:07:18,925
Don't try any funny stuff.
I don't want to hurt you.

1120
01:07:18,975 --> 01:07:20,975
All right, when the signal changes,
get going.

1121
01:07:21,035 --> 01:07:25,384
Turn south on the highway, keep running
fifty and don't run any red lights.

1122
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:43,576
May I ask where we're going?

1123
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:45,463
Keep driving. You'll find out.

1124
01:07:49,191 --> 01:07:51,451
I suppose you know
what you're getting into.

1125
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,441
This isn't a car theft.

1126
01:07:53,476 --> 01:07:54,478
It's kidnapping.

1127
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:56,528
No one asked you.
I don't want your advice.

1128
01:07:56,881 --> 01:07:59,083
Well, I happen to be a lawyer.

1129
01:07:59,111 --> 01:07:59,952
Maybe...

1130
01:07:59,981 --> 01:08:01,272
Maybe you can keep your mouth shut too.

1131
01:08:01,322 --> 01:08:03,637
No, Dan, let him talk.
He might be able to help us.

1132
01:08:03,904 --> 01:08:05,206
She's right.

1133
01:08:05,367 --> 01:08:08,006
Whatever it is that you're running away
from, this is worse.

1134
01:08:08,303 --> 01:08:10,816
Kidnapping is a capital offense.

1135
01:08:10,959 --> 01:08:12,780
They can hang you for it.

1136
01:08:13,353 --> 01:08:15,142
What's the difference?

1137
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,380
They're going to hang me anyway.

1138
01:08:19,794 --> 01:08:21,342
I just killed a man.

1139
01:08:23,845 --> 01:08:25,845
How about the girl?

1140
01:08:25,899 --> 01:08:28,315
You leave her out of it.
She had nothing to do with it.

1141
01:08:28,815 --> 01:08:30,053
I believe that.

1142
01:08:30,383 --> 01:08:31,780
But will the police?

1143
01:08:32,045 --> 01:08:36,520
Look, son, I can see this girl
means something to you.

1144
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:38,862
Why don't you tell me what happened?

1145
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:40,081
For her sake.

1146
01:08:40,131 --> 01:08:42,310
She'd need a lawyer sooner or later.

1147
01:08:45,594 --> 01:08:47,594
Maybe you're right.

1148
01:08:48,921 --> 01:08:50,921
If you're sure you can keep her
in the clear.

1149
01:08:51,421 --> 01:08:53,118
If she's innocent,

1150
01:08:53,253 --> 01:08:55,008
you tell me the whole story,

1151
01:08:55,386 --> 01:08:56,665
and it's the truth.

1152
01:08:57,594 --> 01:08:58,878
The truth.

1153
01:09:00,408 --> 01:09:02,027
I don't know where to begin.

1154
01:09:02,259 --> 01:09:04,259
Start at the beginning.

1155
01:09:06,835 --> 01:09:08,835
<i>The guy was a lawyer,

1156
01:09:08,946 --> 01:09:11,605
<i>Maybe he could help Helen.
 So I told him the whole story.

1157
01:09:11,683 --> 01:09:16,055
<i>I told him about sticking up Shorty
and breaking into the penny arcade.

1158
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:18,586
<i>I told him about Vera and Nick
and old man Mackey.

1159
01:09:19,086 --> 01:09:21,086
<i>I told him everything that had happened.

1160
01:09:21,213 --> 01:09:23,213
<i>From the very beginning to the end.

1161
01:09:24,839 --> 01:09:26,346
I see.

1162
01:09:26,627 --> 01:09:29,537
Now the first thing you ought to know
is where the girl stands.

1163
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:31,234
That's right.

1164
01:09:31,629 --> 01:09:32,977
She's in the clear.

1165
01:09:33,039 --> 01:09:34,328
They can't touch her.

1166
01:09:34,455 --> 01:09:35,828
How about Dan?

1167
01:09:35,882 --> 01:09:38,053
You said maybe it wouldn't be murder.
It might be manslaughter.

1168
01:09:38,164 --> 01:09:40,164
No, it's murder all right.

1169
01:09:41,151 --> 01:09:44,064
I might be able to get him off
with second degree.

1170
01:09:44,382 --> 01:09:46,643
They'd have a hard time
proving premeditation.

1171
01:09:46,693 --> 01:09:49,068
Second degree.
That would mean life, wouldn't it?

1172
01:09:49,219 --> 01:09:50,560
It could.

1173
01:09:51,165 --> 01:09:53,165
I'd rather they hung me.

1174
01:09:53,665 --> 01:09:56,004
There's one discrepancy in your story.

1175
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:59,243
It's worth checking up on because
 if we get the right answer,

1176
01:09:59,287 --> 01:10:00,452
Murder's out.

1177
01:10:00,502 --> 01:10:02,045
Manslaughter too.

1178
01:10:02,332 --> 01:10:03,796
What do you mean?

1179
01:10:03,846 --> 01:10:05,625
How do you know he's dead?

1180
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:08,940
He's dead, that's all.

1181
01:10:09,116 --> 01:10:11,633
His head fell over on the desk
like he was dead.

1182
01:10:11,809 --> 01:10:13,809
It would do that if he were unconscious.

1183
01:10:14,309 --> 01:10:15,787
Did you feel his pulse?

1184
01:10:15,987 --> 01:10:17,441
Or listen for a heartbeat?

1185
01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:19,730
No, I didn't.

1186
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:21,718
Men don't die easily.

1187
01:10:22,007 --> 01:10:24,007
They take a lot of killing.

1188
01:10:24,748 --> 01:10:28,039
I can imagine Mackey sitting
 in a police station right now.

1189
01:10:28,089 --> 01:10:30,777
Telling the desk man
what a narrow escape he had.

1190
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:35,173
If he only was alive...

1191
01:10:35,243 --> 01:10:37,948
I'd give myself up to the first cop
that came along.

1192
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:40,151
Here's an all night restaurant.

1193
01:10:40,201 --> 01:10:43,693
Why don't I use their phone
and find out how Mackey is?

1194
01:10:43,735 --> 01:10:46,098
Why don't you keep on driving
till I tell you how Mackey is?

1195
01:10:46,122 --> 01:10:47,219
He's dead, that's what. He's dead.

1196
01:10:47,241 --> 01:10:48,624
Oh, but Dan, maybe he isn't.

1197
01:10:48,642 --> 01:10:49,881
He is. I know he is.

1198
01:10:49,931 --> 01:10:51,678
I didn't want to kill anybody.

1199
01:10:52,064 --> 01:10:54,832
I don't want to kill you now but if you
 try any more funny stuff, I'll...

1200
01:10:55,494 --> 01:10:57,494
I'll blow a hole right through you.

1201
01:10:58,335 --> 01:11:00,335
What day is this, Helen?
-It's Saturday.

1202
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:02,949
No it isn't. It's Sunday morning.

1203
01:11:03,863 --> 01:11:05,863
We still have a couple of hours
before daylight.

1204
01:11:06,363 --> 01:11:07,948
We can still make it.

1205
01:11:08,448 --> 01:11:10,015
Turn this car around.

1206
01:11:20,515 --> 01:11:22,515
Where are we going now?

1207
01:11:22,565 --> 01:11:23,976
Remember Buzz Larson?
-Yeah.

1208
01:11:24,004 --> 01:11:26,004
He's taking a fishing party way down
past San Diego this morning.

1209
01:11:26,016 --> 01:11:28,016
If we can get to the pier in time,
I can go with him.

1210
01:11:28,037 --> 01:11:28,712
To Mexico?

1211
01:11:28,762 --> 01:11:31,317
Way past the Mexican border.
Step on it, will you?

1212
01:11:42,372 --> 01:11:44,372
I hope the boat is still here.

1213
01:11:45,123 --> 01:11:47,123
Yeah, there it is.

1214
01:11:47,317 --> 01:11:49,623
Down there. We made it.

1215
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:57,667
We'd better hurry.
-I'd better hurry. Not you.

1216
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,033
I'm going with you, Dan.

1217
01:11:59,057 --> 01:12:01,358
There's no harbor below San Diego.
I'll have to swim in from the sea.

1218
01:12:01,372 --> 01:12:02,401
I'm going with you, Danny.

1219
01:12:02,451 --> 01:12:05,407
You've taken too many chances already.
I've got to go on by myself from here.

1220
01:12:05,494 --> 01:12:08,158
I'll send for you as soon as I get
a job. You know that, don't you?

1221
01:12:08,206 --> 01:12:08,979
Yes, but...

1222
01:12:09,006 --> 01:12:11,006
Oh, Dan don't go. I'm so afraid.

1223
01:12:11,056 --> 01:12:12,683
There's nothing to be afraid of.

1224
01:12:13,285 --> 01:12:15,359
Hey, wait a minute.

1225
01:12:15,403 --> 01:12:18,078
How are we going to keep him from going
to the cops till the boat pulls out.

1226
01:12:18,128 --> 01:12:20,128
I'll keep him away. Give me the gun.

1227
01:12:20,281 --> 01:12:22,003
I wouldn't do that if I were you,.

1228
01:12:22,069 --> 01:12:22,914
Why not?

1229
01:12:22,954 --> 01:12:24,800
I told you the girl was in the clear.

1230
01:12:24,850 --> 01:12:26,549
She won't be if she takes that gun.

1231
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:28,309
After that, she'd be an accessory.

1232
01:12:28,347 --> 01:12:30,479
Don't listen to him, Dan,
you've got to get away.

1233
01:12:30,517 --> 01:12:33,181
He's right. You've got to be kept out
of this. That's all that's important.

1234
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:35,210
Would you take my word for something?
-I might.

1235
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:39,277
As a citizen,
I have to notify the police.

1236
01:12:39,349 --> 01:12:41,756
But as a friend, I don't have to hurry.

1237
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:43,972
Thanks.

1238
01:12:48,102 --> 01:12:49,883
Would you do me another favor?

1239
01:12:49,915 --> 01:12:50,811
If I can.

1240
01:12:50,837 --> 01:12:52,554
Don't wait till the boat pulls out
of the harbor.

1241
01:12:52,582 --> 01:12:53,366
Leave now?

1242
01:12:53,416 --> 01:12:55,416
I'll get out of here right away,
-Thanks.

1243
01:13:18,055 --> 01:13:20,471
You haven't seen Brady
since noon Monday?

1244
01:13:20,506 --> 01:13:22,677
No, I haven't.
-And you haven't heard from him either?

1245
01:13:22,727 --> 01:13:23,797
Nope.

1246
01:13:24,245 --> 01:13:25,944
Wait a minute, I just remembered. 

1247
01:13:25,976 --> 01:13:27,227
He phoned me Monday afternoon.

1248
01:13:27,245 --> 01:13:28,677
For any particular reason?

1249
01:13:28,701 --> 01:13:30,579
Yeah, I owed him $20.

1250
01:13:30,603 --> 01:13:31,985
He said he needed it.

1251
01:13:32,012 --> 01:13:34,384
There's a news broadcast at six o'clock.

1252
01:13:34,404 --> 01:13:36,436
I want to hear before
I talk to the authorities.

1253
01:13:36,486 --> 01:13:39,655
<i>...every airport, every bus depot
and every railroad station

1254
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:42,118
<i>in a determined effort to prevent
 the killer's escape.

1255
01:13:42,192 --> 01:13:45,376
<i>At 4 o'clock this morning,
officers threw roadblocks

1256
01:13:45,426 --> 01:13:49,060
<i>across both state highways, and are now
stopping all outbound cars

1257
01:13:49,098 --> 01:13:52,217
<i>but at last report, McDonald
was still at large.

1258
01:13:52,251 --> 01:13:53,142
McDonald.

1259
01:13:53,171 --> 01:13:56,308
<i>Meanwhile police officers
Huxton and Chandler are dead.

1260
01:13:56,329 --> 01:13:59,515
<i>Deputy Sheriff Alan P. Janus was
taken to the emergency hospital

1261
01:13:59,528 --> 01:14:00,973
<i>with two bullets in his thigh.

1262
01:14:00,990 --> 01:14:02,478
I'll get it a little louder.

1263
01:14:02,493 --> 01:14:04,265
<i>Closer to home, Beach City authorities

1264
01:14:04,283 --> 01:14:07,038
<i>are seeking garage mechanic,
Daniel Brady, 26,

1265
01:14:07,088 --> 01:14:09,193
<i>an employee of the Mackey Motor Company

1266
01:14:09,235 --> 01:14:12,200
<i>Late yesterday evening, watchman
Michael J. O'Brien, while making

1267
01:14:12,244 --> 01:14:15,889
<i>his regular nightly rounds, discovered
the unconscious body of Oren Mackey

1268
01:14:15,938 --> 01:14:18,516
<i>President of the automobile agency
lying in his office.

1269
01:14:18,547 --> 01:14:21,077
<i>Mackey regained consciousness at
St. Mark's Hospital

1270
01:14:21,127 --> 01:14:23,831
<i>shortly after midnight and named Brady
as his assailant.

1271
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:25,477
Then he's alive!

1272
01:14:25,790 --> 01:14:29,606
Tom, watch yourself if we run into
that kid. He's dangerous.

1273
01:14:30,061 --> 01:14:32,061
What's dangerous about him?

1274
01:14:32,111 --> 01:14:33,777
He's got Mackey's gun.

1275
01:14:38,681 --> 01:14:40,105
Hey, Buzz.

1276
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:41,411
Buzz.

1277
01:14:41,627 --> 01:14:43,627
Wait a minute. I'm coming.

1278
01:14:44,123 --> 01:14:46,123
Who's this pulling in?

1279
01:14:46,173 --> 01:14:47,701
That might be our boy.

1280
01:14:47,755 --> 01:14:49,147
Let's take a look at him.

1281
01:15:09,534 --> 01:15:11,534
You there. Stop.

1282
01:15:15,129 --> 01:15:17,096
Hey, Brady.

1283
01:15:17,146 --> 01:15:19,146
Watch yourself.

1284
01:15:19,646 --> 01:15:21,646
Buzz.

1285
01:15:21,749 --> 01:15:23,749
Wait a minute.

1286
01:16:04,183 --> 01:16:05,960
Watch yourself, he's shooting.

1287
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:08,460
I'll go after him. You stay on top.

1288
01:16:33,639 --> 01:16:35,425
I heard shooting!

1289
01:16:48,141 --> 01:16:50,815
Did you see him?
-No, he didn't come through here.

1290
01:16:52,924 --> 01:16:54,423
Look, what's that?

1291
01:16:59,751 --> 01:17:01,251
I'm coming, Dan.

1292
01:17:01,301 --> 01:17:03,301
It's all right.
You didn't kill him, Dan.

1293
01:17:05,269 --> 01:17:07,042
What's going on?
-What happened?

1294
01:17:07,082 --> 01:17:09,082
The cops. They shot a guy.

1295
01:17:09,113 --> 01:17:11,113
I heard about it  on the radio.
-Heard about who?

1296
01:17:11,163 --> 01:17:13,163
The guy who killed a couple of cops.

1297
01:17:15,033 --> 01:17:17,033
I don't know but he shot somebody.

1298
01:17:17,862 --> 01:17:19,862
They got him.

1299
01:17:20,568 --> 01:17:21,934
Stand back, folks. Give him room.

1300
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:24,004
guy that got shot right there

1301
01:17:27,465 --> 01:17:28,906
Where did you say you auto was?

1302
01:17:28,946 --> 01:17:29,961
On the pier right over there.

1303
01:17:29,992 --> 01:17:31,992
Put him in the car and I'll
drive him straight to the hospital.

1304
01:17:32,042 --> 01:17:33,619
If that's all right with you.
-Certainly.

1305
01:17:33,739 --> 01:17:36,069
Save much time instead of
waiting for the ambulance.

1306
01:17:36,171 --> 01:17:38,382
I wouldn't have shot you
only I thought you had a gun.

1307
01:17:38,432 --> 01:17:40,049
What did you do with it?
-I dropped it.

1308
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,373
What do you think
they're going to give me?

1309
01:17:42,423 --> 01:17:44,423
Have you ever been in trouble before?
-No, no, never.

1310
01:17:44,794 --> 01:17:48,110
I think we can rule out the watch
and the twenty dollar bill.

1311
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:50,399
They'll probably charge you
with the holdup,

1312
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:53,065
stealing the car and breaking into
the penny arcade.

1313
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:56,957
That could add up to anything from
one to ten years.

1314
01:17:57,142 --> 01:17:58,598
But since you're a first offender, 

1315
01:17:58,648 --> 01:18:01,454
my guess is that it will be
nearer to one than ten.

1316
01:18:01,534 --> 01:18:03,534
Whatever it is, I'll take it.

1317
01:18:04,034 --> 01:18:06,693
Whatever it is,
I'll be waiting for you, Dan.

1318
01:18:07,002 --> 01:18:08,321
If you want me to.

1319
01:18:08,371 --> 01:18:09,890
You're a great gal, Helen.

1320
01:18:10,114 --> 01:18:11,460
I love you, Dan.

1321
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:13,569
That goes both ways.
