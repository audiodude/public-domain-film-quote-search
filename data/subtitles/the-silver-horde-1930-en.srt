1
00:02:10,529 --> 00:02:12,435
Go away, no can do.

2
00:02:27,412 --> 00:02:28,447
Let us wait.

3
00:02:55,982 --> 00:03:01,193
You know, I got a hunch that
these guineas don't want us around here.

4
00:03:02,447 --> 00:03:04,733
I'm going to give
this village one more chance.

5
00:03:04,908 --> 00:03:05,908
See that house?

6
00:03:06,743 --> 00:03:08,483
I'm going to get in there and tear it down.

7
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:35,393
Open up inside. We're friends.

8
00:03:41,945 --> 00:03:43,606
We're off the long trail.

9
00:03:44,114 --> 00:03:45,524
We're tired and hungry.

10
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,485
We'll pay.

11
00:03:49,536 --> 00:03:51,401
Vamoose. Get out.

12
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,790
Come on, Fraser.

13
00:04:25,655 --> 00:04:27,361
Will you two boys stop playing games

14
00:04:27,532 --> 00:04:29,568
long enough to tell me
what this is all about?

15
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:33,910
Quit that, Balt.

16
00:04:35,832 --> 00:04:36,832
Well mister?

17
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:39,453
Just teaching him manners ma'am.

18
00:04:40,295 --> 00:04:42,911
This village seems to have
strange notions of etiquette.

19
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:45,546
Strikes me you've got
rather original manners yourself.

20
00:04:45,717 --> 00:04:47,628
Is this your usual introduction?

21
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:49,714
I'm sorry. I lost my temper.

22
00:04:50,347 --> 00:04:52,759
My name is Emerson. Boyd Emerson.

23
00:04:52,932 --> 00:04:54,923
Mine is Malotte, Cherry Malotte.

24
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:56,432
I'm boss around here.

25
00:04:56,603 --> 00:04:58,810
Did you say the name was Cherry Malotte?

26
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,600
That mean something to you mister?

27
00:05:02,108 --> 00:05:04,815
Why, no, no. No ma'am.

28
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:08,149
I, I got a terrible bad memory for names.

29
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:11,364
This is George Balt.

30
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:14,780
Behave, George.

31
00:05:15,997 --> 00:05:18,613
George is, well, he's my watchdog.

32
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:20,532
He was acting under my orders.

33
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,350
We'll try to make up for our bad manners
if you'll stay for dinner.

34
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,620
Will you?

35
00:05:24,798 --> 00:05:26,413
Clamion will look after your dogs.

36
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,524
I'd forgotten what decent linen felt like
and the touch of pure crystal.

37
00:05:46,194 --> 00:05:51,484
Takes a gent of refinement like myself
to appreciate a swell layout like this.

38
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:59,363
After the trail, it's like a dream of peace.

39
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,997
It's about as peaceful

40
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:03,203
as smoking a cigarette on a keg of dynamite.

41
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:07,579
You walked into a neat, little knockdown
and drag-out mister.

42
00:06:07,757 --> 00:06:09,497
Is that why I got the chilly reception?

43
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:12,884
They thought you were on my side,
and Balt thought you were on theirs.

44
00:06:13,722 --> 00:06:16,589
You see, the salmon syndicate
owns this town of Kalvik,

45
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:19,132
the chief fishing port, salmon.

46
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,802
And the village has orders
not to give shelter, even to a dying man.

47
00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:25,472
Well, that's against every
decent law of the north country.

48
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,642
Syndicate's afraid strangers
will come, find gold or copper,

49
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,186
and stampede the workers
away from the fishery.

50
00:06:31,364 --> 00:06:35,698
- And they're trying to force you out?
- Fair means afoul, mostly foul.

51
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:38,110
But they wouldn't harm you, a woman.

52
00:06:38,705 --> 00:06:39,740
Wouldn't they though?

53
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,246
The man who owns the syndicate

54
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:44,908
considers murder
just an incident of business.

55
00:06:45,086 --> 00:06:46,667
Fred marsh.

56
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,669
- Someday nice and slow...
- Quit it, Balt.

57
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:56,920
They tried to steal my fishing place.

58
00:06:57,098 --> 00:06:59,089
You see my cannery shed out there?

59
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:01,849
It ain't got no machinery in it
on account of marsh.

60
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,808
- He wrecked my boat.
- George, be quiet.

61
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:16,023
I simply can't understand it.

62
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:19,819
How a woman used to, well, things like this

63
00:07:19,996 --> 00:07:21,827
chooses to live in this north country.

64
00:07:21,998 --> 00:07:23,989
Endures hardships and violence.

65
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:26,415
Oh, I rather enjoy it at times.

66
00:07:26,586 --> 00:07:27,917
And other women have done it.

67
00:07:28,087 --> 00:07:31,579
Yes. Other women but not...

68
00:07:31,758 --> 00:07:34,044
Excuse me for changing the subject,

69
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:38,428
but may I trouble you to slip me
the preserved peaches?

70
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:41,635
Say, are you kicking me
for any special reason mister?

71
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,302
No, no. Oh, oh, excuse me.

72
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,311
I meant to kick him.

73
00:07:47,482 --> 00:07:48,892
That is, I mean, I...

74
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,981
Pardon my glove.

75
00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:08,916
Queer partner for a young fella like you.

76
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:10,952
Neither one of us
can afford to be too finicky.

77
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,416
I picked him up on the trail
just about all in

78
00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:14,922
three days ago.

79
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:19,173
I fancy he could arrange board and lodging.

80
00:08:19,347 --> 00:08:20,837
You mean in some jail?

81
00:08:21,808 --> 00:08:23,673
I'm afraid so myself.

82
00:09:11,774 --> 00:09:13,310
If you'll excuse me,

83
00:09:13,484 --> 00:09:15,566
I'll crawl in the old hay.

84
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:40,625
Say, just what the, what the...

85
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:47,557
Oh, you think you're so smart
just because you're bigger than me.

86
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:55,979
And her, playing la-Di-de music to him
like some society dame.

87
00:09:56,778 --> 00:10:01,192
Wait till he finds out who Cherry Malotte is.

88
00:10:01,366 --> 00:10:02,366
You know, eh?

89
00:10:04,243 --> 00:10:05,653
You think you'll tell?

90
00:10:05,828 --> 00:10:07,489
Not me, brother. Not me.

91
00:10:07,664 --> 00:10:09,154
I ain't saying a word.

92
00:10:38,152 --> 00:10:39,813
Been having a tough time mister?

93
00:10:41,656 --> 00:10:44,022
I guess they've been kicking you around,
haven't they?

94
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,945
Feel like talking about it?

95
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,076
There's nothing much to talk about.

96
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:51,738
I thought I could beat this north country,
and it beat me.

97
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,122
That's all.

98
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:54,327
Gold mining?

99
00:10:55,378 --> 00:10:56,493
It's a tough game.

100
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,961
But stay with it. You'll get a break.

101
00:10:59,716 --> 00:11:02,503
I've had breaks, the wrong kind.

102
00:11:02,677 --> 00:11:06,169
Two years of breaks. I've had enough.

103
00:11:07,849 --> 00:11:09,305
It's tough.

104
00:11:09,475 --> 00:11:12,683
But there's something more to life
than rolling up a pile of money.

105
00:11:13,563 --> 00:11:16,270
I know. Sounds like
something out of a copy book.

106
00:11:17,316 --> 00:11:20,274
But there's something bigger
than finding a gold mine.

107
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:23,902
And that's finding yourself.

108
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:26,440
Well, I'd need a guide to find even myself.

109
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:28,778
Got some pretty good guides
in this country mister.

110
00:11:28,953 --> 00:11:30,568
Oh, it isn't so easy to quit.

111
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:32,703
Quitting can be harder than hanging on.

112
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:34,416
But I'm through.

113
00:11:35,084 --> 00:11:36,369
Don't say that.

114
00:11:36,544 --> 00:11:39,081
I don't believe it. You're just tired.

115
00:11:39,255 --> 00:11:41,712
Things will look brighter in the morning.
Brace up mister.

116
00:11:41,883 --> 00:11:43,589
I'll be just as broke in the morning.

117
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,795
Broke? What of it?

118
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,585
I guess you've never been broke,

119
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:49,845
cold, stony broke.

120
00:11:50,016 --> 00:11:51,927
Then you've got another guess coming.

121
00:11:52,101 --> 00:11:55,343
I've been so broke a dime
would've looked as big as a soup plate.

122
00:11:55,521 --> 00:11:56,636
You won out though.

123
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:03,059
I guess you do need a guide.

124
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:06,691
Money is easy to get.

125
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:09,528
Too darned easy.

126
00:12:12,121 --> 00:12:13,121
Tell me.

127
00:12:14,707 --> 00:12:16,618
What would you do to get money?

128
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:20,869
Ask me what I wouldn't do.
Just give me a chance.

129
00:12:22,507 --> 00:12:24,623
You know, I think I will at that.

130
00:12:33,726 --> 00:12:37,765
Of course, it ain't none of my business,
but we've been here ten days now.

131
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:39,429
Eating regular, ain't you?

132
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:41,147
Am I squawking?

133
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:43,308
No.

134
00:12:44,237 --> 00:12:47,900
Only I'm worried account of how
they go out together every morning.

135
00:12:48,741 --> 00:12:51,403
And they're gone all day.

136
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:03,252
Oh, that was a run.
Does things to the old body, doesn't it?

137
00:13:03,422 --> 00:13:05,834
And I thought I never wanted
to see a dog sled again.

138
00:13:06,008 --> 00:13:07,544
Come on, let's tell the boys.

139
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:14,176
Hello fellas.
I've got some good news for you.

140
00:13:16,102 --> 00:13:18,935
Balt, shake hands with your new partner.

141
00:13:20,356 --> 00:13:22,563
Him? My partner?

142
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:25,725
Listen, balt, you've got
the best fishing site in Alaska.

143
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:26,733
Yeah.

144
00:13:26,904 --> 00:13:29,862
But you need money to put machinery
in that canning shed of yours.

145
00:13:30,032 --> 00:13:31,818
$200,000.

146
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:34,074
Boyd is going to get it for you.

147
00:13:36,372 --> 00:13:37,782
Do you remember Tom Hilliard?

148
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:40,285
Tom Hilliard. Yeah.

149
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:42,074
Tom Hilliard was in Nome.

150
00:13:42,253 --> 00:13:44,995
He was a banker but a good man anyway.

151
00:13:45,173 --> 00:13:46,709
Well Tom is in Seattle now.

152
00:13:46,883 --> 00:13:49,590
That's where Boyd is going,
and you're going with him.

153
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,628
Boyd will get the money, you'll buy
supplies and round up your fishing gang.

154
00:13:54,807 --> 00:13:55,967
You mean it?

155
00:13:58,352 --> 00:14:00,263
You won't be scared of rough work?

156
00:14:01,397 --> 00:14:02,512
Will you fight?

157
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:05,185
Will you fight dirty?

158
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:06,565
The dirtier, the better.

159
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:26,206
You'll have your hands full
in Seattle with balt.

160
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,166
He's never been in a city before.

161
00:14:29,884 --> 00:14:31,090
So long, Fraser.

162
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,508
You're going on a strange trail
this time, balt.

163
00:14:36,682 --> 00:14:38,422
You mind Emerson, savvy?

164
00:14:58,246 --> 00:14:59,577
Cherry...

165
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:03,197
Why are you doing it? For me?

166
00:15:03,376 --> 00:15:05,662
You may be cussing me before you're through.

167
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:08,703
It's not because,
because you're sorry for me?

168
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:11,497
Sorry? For a big, healthy bohunk like you?

169
00:15:12,843 --> 00:15:14,629
You've put me on my feet.

170
00:15:14,804 --> 00:15:16,544
You've helped me find myself.

171
00:15:16,722 --> 00:15:19,054
Well, I'm just pointing out the way.

172
00:15:19,225 --> 00:15:21,136
You've got to fight the trail yourself.

173
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:24,802
Goodbye Boyd. Good luck.

174
00:15:38,536 --> 00:15:39,536
Mush.

175
00:15:39,578 --> 00:15:40,658
Mush.

176
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:47,242
Chakawana, I'm afraid I'm being a darn fool.

177
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,500
Yes ma'am.

178
00:16:23,873 --> 00:16:26,410
Kind of loud, ain't it?

179
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:30,576
Loud? It's class, big fella.

180
00:16:31,672 --> 00:16:33,333
Would I steer you wrong?

181
00:16:33,507 --> 00:16:34,917
Look at me.

182
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:39,964
But that skimmer, eh?

183
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,549
It's terrible.

184
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:45,842
Oh, listen.

185
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,262
All my life I always wanted a hat like this.

186
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:51,730
Gee.

187
00:16:53,527 --> 00:16:56,314
Well, I'm glad I noticed this. Eh?

188
00:16:56,489 --> 00:16:58,775
Our next stop will be a manicure parlor.

189
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:00,655
You mean one of them places where women

190
00:17:00,826 --> 00:17:03,568
cleans your fingernails and shines them up?

191
00:17:03,746 --> 00:17:05,737
Oh, gosh, I don't want to...

192
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:08,395
- Come on, don't be a hick all your life.
- I couldn't do that.

193
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:11,579
Honest. A woman fooling around
with my fingers?

194
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:15,872
I'll go back to the hotel
and wash my own hands,

195
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,756
and wash them good too. Come on.

196
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,342
Well, that settles that, I guess.

197
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,930
The loan will be put through

198
00:17:29,105 --> 00:17:31,345
and 200,000 placed to your credit
by the end of the week.

199
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:34,478
And I can go ahead and order my machinery,
charter the boat?

200
00:17:34,652 --> 00:17:36,713
You've been mighty generous about this,
Mr. Hilliard.

201
00:17:36,737 --> 00:17:40,070
Nonsense. It's only that I happen to be
familiar with conditions up there.

202
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:42,273
By the way, how's Cherry?

203
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,242
That is Miss Malotte?

204
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:47,744
Remarkable woman, isn't she?

205
00:17:47,915 --> 00:17:51,157
She's been a great pal
to me Mr.Hilliard. A real friend.

206
00:17:51,335 --> 00:17:53,200
Kind of pal one man is to another.

207
00:17:54,672 --> 00:17:57,254
Yes, of course. Quite so...

208
00:17:57,425 --> 00:17:59,336
man to man, you might say.

209
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,751
I'll see you in a couple of days then.
Thanks again.

210
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:02,929
So long.

211
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:08,549
- Dorothy?
- Yes?

212
00:18:11,397 --> 00:18:13,558
Brother, you got a pair of mitts.

213
00:18:13,732 --> 00:18:17,941
If you ever had your fortune told,
you'd have to hire three palm readers.

214
00:18:19,864 --> 00:18:26,155
You see, we're both big,
strong silent men from them open spaces.

215
00:18:26,328 --> 00:18:27,443
Oh.

216
00:18:27,621 --> 00:18:31,284
Look Lady, you didn't do this one so good.

217
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:35,418
- You don't want them too shiny.
- I want mine too shiny.

218
00:18:37,131 --> 00:18:39,964
Do that with the little shoe brush, eh?

219
00:18:46,974 --> 00:18:49,681
So this is where you hot sports hang out?

220
00:18:49,852 --> 00:18:52,013
This is his third manicure since noon.

221
00:18:52,188 --> 00:18:54,520
I've been looking all over for you.
We go to work tomorrow.

222
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,932
- Me, work?
- Got the money from Tom Hilliard?

223
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,150
And you can start buying
your machinery and supplies

224
00:19:00,196 --> 00:19:01,936
and rounding up that fishing gang of yours.

225
00:19:02,114 --> 00:19:04,150
See you in the morning. Early.

226
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:05,325
So long.

227
00:19:08,037 --> 00:19:10,198
He's kind of grand, ain't he?

228
00:19:10,372 --> 00:19:12,454
He's my secretary, sorta.

229
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:13,990
Oh.

230
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:20,209
Say, how About you and me
making a sirloin steak look ridiculous?

231
00:19:21,258 --> 00:19:23,874
After you get through shoeing this horse.

232
00:19:25,221 --> 00:19:30,682
I'm simply a wrap-up for strong, silent guys.

233
00:19:31,352 --> 00:19:34,890
Hey Lady, you forgot this one.

234
00:19:45,407 --> 00:19:48,615
It's romantic, of course,
but you can't really marry him dear girl.

235
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:50,196
Emerson is still a pauper.

236
00:19:51,914 --> 00:19:55,281
You're just being one of these fussy,
old-fashioned fathers.

237
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:59,452
Alas, I'm afraid it's the fate of fathers
to seem old-fashioned and fussy.

238
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,167
Boyd is not after my money, more is the pity.

239
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:04,627
And we could be happy without a penny.

240
00:20:07,346 --> 00:20:09,758
You don't really believe that,
old girl, do you?

241
00:20:11,058 --> 00:20:14,346
Well, no, to be entirely truthful.

242
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,181
You're used to pennies.

243
00:20:16,355 --> 00:20:19,347
You're spoiled, my precious lamb,
and downright selfish.

244
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:24,185
Because you want me to marry Freddy,
isn't it, old boy?

245
00:20:24,363 --> 00:20:26,524
Well, to be entirely truthful...

246
00:20:27,074 --> 00:20:28,780
I won't, do you hear?

247
00:20:28,951 --> 00:20:31,784
I won't marry Freddy.
I don't care if he is your friend.

248
00:20:31,954 --> 00:20:36,197
- I tell you, I won't marry...
- Come now, comfort of my declining years.

249
00:20:37,376 --> 00:20:39,241
Welcome Freddy, old boy.

250
00:20:42,673 --> 00:20:44,129
Just been discussing you.

251
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,836
Not too unkindly, I trust?

252
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:49,969
I've just been saying
I wouldn't marry you on a bet Freddy.

253
00:20:51,265 --> 00:20:54,428
- But why not?
- Because her father favors it, of course.

254
00:20:54,602 --> 00:20:56,934
You should've a little respect
for your father's wishes.

255
00:20:57,104 --> 00:21:00,596
Oh, I have. Darn little.

256
00:21:00,774 --> 00:21:02,981
That's all right. I'll find the way.

257
00:21:05,946 --> 00:21:07,902
The conquering hero?

258
00:21:12,328 --> 00:21:15,240
Hello, Emerson, my boy.
Glad to see you again.

259
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,156
Freddy, I'd like you to meet Mr. Emerson.

260
00:21:19,335 --> 00:21:21,826
You've heard us speak of him.
Boyd, this is Mr. marsh.

261
00:21:22,463 --> 00:21:23,463
Frederic marsh?

262
00:21:23,631 --> 00:21:27,123
And this is the young man
who went to seek his fortune in Alaska.

263
00:21:27,885 --> 00:21:30,592
- Found it, I trust?
- While looking for it, I had the pleasure

264
00:21:30,763 --> 00:21:32,924
of trying to find shelter
in your town, Kalvik.

265
00:21:33,098 --> 00:21:35,818
Oh, I'm sorry. We have to take harsh steps
to discourage competitors.

266
00:21:35,976 --> 00:21:37,807
Well, this time you encouraged one.

267
00:21:37,978 --> 00:21:40,014
I might as well tell you right now,
Mr. marsh,

268
00:21:40,189 --> 00:21:41,804
I'm going to run a fishery at Kalvik.

269
00:21:41,982 --> 00:21:43,643
That's interesting.

270
00:21:43,817 --> 00:21:46,559
But I doubt if you'll get
financial backing for such a scheme.

271
00:21:46,737 --> 00:21:49,820
Then you may be surprised to find that
I've already arranged for credit.

272
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,481
Today, right in this town.

273
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,651
And my fishery won't fail.

274
00:21:54,828 --> 00:21:57,661
- And no crooked work will make it fail.
- Why Boyd.

275
00:21:57,831 --> 00:22:00,322
Good. And good luck to you.

276
00:22:00,501 --> 00:22:04,244
If there's anything I can do to help you
or any little bit of advice, why...

277
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:06,036
Dinner is served.

278
00:22:11,053 --> 00:22:12,088
What an infant.

279
00:22:14,473 --> 00:22:18,716
You know, I'm terribly afraid he's not
going to succeed at the fishing game.

280
00:22:18,894 --> 00:22:21,476
You know, so am I.

281
00:22:21,647 --> 00:22:22,647
Terribly.

282
00:23:04,398 --> 00:23:06,855
How do you like my gang, eh?

283
00:23:08,068 --> 00:23:09,979
All college men, ain't they?

284
00:23:12,823 --> 00:23:15,656
By golly, we don't want those hippies
in this gang.

285
00:23:17,286 --> 00:23:20,198
That's Svenson. He's the boss.

286
00:23:20,372 --> 00:23:21,578
You don't tell me?

287
00:23:21,749 --> 00:23:23,660
I thought he was their music teacher.

288
00:23:25,335 --> 00:23:28,953
Svenson is a pretty
good scrapper, only he weakens.

289
00:23:29,631 --> 00:23:33,749
He's all right for the first,
oh, maybe an hour and 15 minutes,

290
00:23:33,927 --> 00:23:35,633
but after that, he gets tired.

291
00:23:35,804 --> 00:23:37,635
Just a big quitter, eh?

292
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,051
That's why I lick him every spring.

293
00:23:40,726 --> 00:23:43,843
Is it a habit,
you two guys fighting every year?

294
00:23:44,563 --> 00:23:46,975
Got to lick him,
otherwise, the men won't work for me.

295
00:23:47,566 --> 00:23:49,557
That's the rule of the fishing gang.

296
00:23:49,735 --> 00:23:52,772
They only take orders
from the best scrapper. Eh?

297
00:23:58,911 --> 00:24:00,196
Hi, svenson.

298
00:24:01,246 --> 00:24:03,407
By golly, that was a good fight we had.

299
00:24:03,582 --> 00:24:05,038
You licked me plenty.

300
00:24:05,209 --> 00:24:08,201
And I can do it again,
you monkey-faced button head.

301
00:24:08,378 --> 00:24:10,084
Next time I think I'll lick you.

302
00:24:17,095 --> 00:24:19,677
By golly, you're attempting to be a dude.

303
00:24:21,141 --> 00:24:22,347
Dude, eh?

304
00:24:24,061 --> 00:24:26,677
Listen, you pig eyed pot walloper,

305
00:24:27,356 --> 00:24:30,223
my friend was just saying
you look so ladylike,

306
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,742
he thought you played
one of them, uku, mandolins.

307
00:24:34,863 --> 00:24:36,774
Who said that?

308
00:24:36,949 --> 00:24:39,861
No, I didn't now.
No, I didn't now boss. No, I didn't...

309
00:24:40,035 --> 00:24:43,778
- Get back on your job, you big turtle...
- That's my joke.

310
00:24:43,956 --> 00:24:44,956
Back up there.

311
00:24:45,749 --> 00:24:47,205
And stay there.

312
00:24:59,054 --> 00:25:00,134
Hey, partner.

313
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:04,889
Say the good word and we sail tonight.

314
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,846
It's all off. We're whipped.

315
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,432
- We're loading, ain't we?
- Well, we're not sailing.

316
00:25:09,606 --> 00:25:10,726
Hilliard stopped our credit.

317
00:25:10,899 --> 00:25:13,891
We can't pay for any of that stuff.
We can't even keep our ships chartered.

318
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:16,902
- But hilliard promised us.
- Well, something made him change his mind.

319
00:25:17,072 --> 00:25:19,654
Said his board of directors
wanted more time to look into it.

320
00:25:19,825 --> 00:25:21,781
Oh, that's a stall,
like one of them conferences.

321
00:25:21,952 --> 00:25:24,034
- It was marsh.
- Oh, take it easy now.

322
00:25:24,204 --> 00:25:26,616
It's not marsh, not marsh alone.

323
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,907
He couldn't stop every bank in this town,
and I've been to all of them.

324
00:25:30,085 --> 00:25:31,700
It was marsh.

325
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:34,245
He waited till we got in the hole.

326
00:25:34,423 --> 00:25:39,668
Oh, someday nice and slow.

327
00:25:39,845 --> 00:25:43,554
And I'll say, excuse me please Mr.marsh.

328
00:25:43,724 --> 00:25:45,089
Snap out of it.

329
00:25:45,267 --> 00:25:46,598
Remember you promised Cherry.

330
00:25:48,103 --> 00:25:49,138
Cherry.

331
00:25:50,898 --> 00:25:52,229
Cherry.

332
00:26:10,876 --> 00:26:11,876
Chakawana.

333
00:26:12,502 --> 00:26:14,788
Pack some things, some pretty things.

334
00:26:15,464 --> 00:26:17,125
I'm going to Seattle.

335
00:27:04,888 --> 00:27:07,129
A chummy little booth on the balcony mister.

336
00:27:47,347 --> 00:27:49,508
You shouldn't say such things about Freddy.

337
00:27:49,683 --> 00:27:51,799
He's too big a man
to stand in the way of your deal.

338
00:27:51,977 --> 00:27:53,513
Oh too big for me, eh?

339
00:27:55,814 --> 00:27:58,772
- You're not jealous of Freddy?
- Well, why shouldn't I be?

340
00:27:58,942 --> 00:28:01,433
I know your father wants you to marry him.

341
00:28:03,697 --> 00:28:04,937
Dear Boyd...

342
00:28:06,324 --> 00:28:10,658
If your heart is really set
on going away, leaving me...

343
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:12,694
Well, don't say it that way, Mildred.

344
00:28:12,873 --> 00:28:14,113
It's for us.

345
00:28:16,126 --> 00:28:18,082
If Freddy marsh is really stopping your deal,

346
00:28:18,253 --> 00:28:19,914
I'm sure father knows something about it.

347
00:28:20,088 --> 00:28:22,044
And I'll speak to father.

348
00:28:22,215 --> 00:28:23,830
Oh, it won't be asking help.

349
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:25,965
It'll only be telling him
to call off his dogs.

350
00:28:26,136 --> 00:28:28,843
Not that way. I won't ask any favors.

351
00:28:29,014 --> 00:28:31,005
But you won't be, I will.

352
00:28:32,017 --> 00:28:33,598
Just leave it to me.

353
00:28:34,603 --> 00:28:37,310
Come on, let's forget it and dance.

354
00:28:37,981 --> 00:28:39,096
Shall we?

355
00:28:49,576 --> 00:28:51,112
This is a mint.

356
00:28:51,286 --> 00:28:53,206
You know, going out with you
always makes me feel

357
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,786
something wicked is going to happen.

358
00:28:54,956 --> 00:28:56,446
I'd hate to disappoint you.

359
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:58,707
I'm sure you won't Tom.

360
00:28:58,877 --> 00:29:01,368
Same old Cherry Malotte.
You haven't changed a bit.

361
00:29:01,546 --> 00:29:03,411
You haven't changed a bit either, have you?

362
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,922
- Still got your apartment Tom?
- You ought to see it.

363
00:29:06,093 --> 00:29:07,253
I wonder.

364
00:29:08,303 --> 00:29:10,089
Let's have a showdown Tom.

365
00:29:10,263 --> 00:29:12,845
What's holding up this Emerson deal? Marsh?

366
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,260
It's tougher than that.

367
00:29:15,435 --> 00:29:17,972
It's marsh, backed by Wayne Wayland.

368
00:29:18,146 --> 00:29:19,761
He's told me to lay off.

369
00:29:20,607 --> 00:29:22,097
Taking orders Tom?

370
00:29:22,275 --> 00:29:24,516
I'm afraid you have changed, after all.

371
00:29:25,362 --> 00:29:28,570
I've taken orders only until
I had a chance to talk with you.

372
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,025
It's up to you Cherry.

373
00:29:30,992 --> 00:29:32,528
Alright, let's talk business.

374
00:29:34,204 --> 00:29:35,990
Are you stuck on this fellow, Emerson?

375
00:29:37,749 --> 00:29:39,330
Oh, that's funny.

376
00:29:40,168 --> 00:29:42,409
Me falling for a young fella like him?

377
00:29:42,587 --> 00:29:45,454
He doesn't even know I'm in town.
That's how crazy I am about him.

378
00:29:45,632 --> 00:29:49,250
Well, I'm glad to hear that. I didn't want
to see Emerson make a chump out of you.

379
00:29:50,595 --> 00:29:53,507
Say, that boy hasn't got
a crooked hair on his head.

380
00:29:53,682 --> 00:29:55,513
Why, he's the cleanest, straightest...

381
00:29:58,228 --> 00:29:59,468
I thought so.

382
00:30:00,564 --> 00:30:03,681
No, you aren't stuck on him.

383
00:30:05,026 --> 00:30:06,641
You lied to me Cherry.

384
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,185
Lied like a gentleman.

385
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,571
Let's get down to cases Tom.

386
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,594
Kind of pretty, isn't she? Some society girl?

387
00:30:34,681 --> 00:30:36,137
His girl Cherry.

388
00:30:39,102 --> 00:30:40,387
On the level Tom?

389
00:30:41,354 --> 00:30:43,310
She's Wayland's daughter.

390
00:30:43,481 --> 00:30:45,517
That's why Wayland is blocking the deal.

391
00:30:49,362 --> 00:30:52,604
I suppose he thinks Emerson
isn't good enough for her, eh?

392
00:30:52,782 --> 00:30:54,192
Not rich enough.

393
00:30:54,367 --> 00:30:56,574
And he's trying to keep him
from getting any richer.

394
00:30:57,787 --> 00:30:59,368
Are you going to let him do it Tom?

395
00:31:00,207 --> 00:31:01,492
It's up to you Cherry.

396
00:31:15,263 --> 00:31:18,346
I guess I had a hunch all the time
there was a girl somewhere.

397
00:31:21,353 --> 00:31:23,184
I'm afraid I didn't want to believe it.

398
00:31:25,899 --> 00:31:27,639
And I'm darn sorry Cherry.

399
00:31:31,112 --> 00:31:34,149
Don't be sorry for me. I'll get along.

400
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,066
You've handed it to me right on the chin.

401
00:31:40,872 --> 00:31:42,112
And I had it coming.

402
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:47,909
Oh, let's get out of here.

403
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:51,288
Where will it be?

404
00:31:54,135 --> 00:31:55,796
How about that apartment of yours?

405
00:32:26,334 --> 00:32:28,700
Hello? Hello?

406
00:32:33,383 --> 00:32:34,919
Hello? Hel...

407
00:32:36,136 --> 00:32:37,136
Wait.

408
00:32:46,813 --> 00:32:48,144
Hey, what's the idea?

409
00:32:50,483 --> 00:32:54,192
Why don't you learn to talk over a phone,
you big lug?

410
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,855
Who is it, a dame or a guy?

411
00:33:01,786 --> 00:33:04,869
Hello? Who?

412
00:33:05,832 --> 00:33:06,947
Oh, oh.

413
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:10,033
- Emerson gone out?
- Yeah.

414
00:33:10,211 --> 00:33:14,671
Two hours ago, all dressed up
in them funny pants for riding horseback.

415
00:33:14,841 --> 00:33:15,876
He's gone out.

416
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:19,217
I don't know. No.

417
00:33:21,222 --> 00:33:23,634
More bad news, I suppose.

418
00:33:25,268 --> 00:33:28,476
Someday Boyd, every day like this.

419
00:33:28,646 --> 00:33:31,638
Only we'll ride my horses, not your father's.

420
00:33:31,816 --> 00:33:34,148
Now, don't grumble
and spoil our little breakfast.

421
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:35,855
Telephone for Mr. Emerson.

422
00:33:41,242 --> 00:33:44,109
Hello? Yes, this is Emerson.

423
00:33:46,331 --> 00:33:48,037
What? No.

424
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,206
You really mean it?

425
00:33:53,838 --> 00:33:56,545
My board of directors
decided after all to approve the loan.

426
00:33:56,716 --> 00:33:58,502
Well, I don't know how to thank you.

427
00:33:58,676 --> 00:34:00,257
Don't thank me.

428
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:10,553
And I really can go ahead?
Well, that's just wonderful.

429
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,311
Thanks. Goodbye.

430
00:34:14,776 --> 00:34:16,186
You did it for me.

431
00:34:16,361 --> 00:34:18,773
And I thought
you hadn't even seen your father.

432
00:34:18,947 --> 00:34:20,687
- But I haven't. I...
- Fibber.

433
00:34:21,282 --> 00:34:22,772
Lovely little liar.

434
00:34:26,454 --> 00:34:27,910
How else could it have happened?

435
00:34:28,081 --> 00:34:31,323
Happy, wasn't he? He's like a big boy.

436
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:33,662
I daresay he thinks he did it himself.

437
00:34:33,837 --> 00:34:35,828
That's the way I want it to be.

438
00:34:36,005 --> 00:34:37,415
I don't understand you Cherry.

439
00:34:38,341 --> 00:34:40,297
Do you want me to weep on your shoulder?

440
00:34:40,468 --> 00:34:43,801
Just because he doesn't like me
doesn't change him, does it?

441
00:34:43,972 --> 00:34:45,303
He's a nice boy.

442
00:34:46,391 --> 00:34:47,847
You're a mighty good loser.

443
00:34:50,019 --> 00:34:51,350
Don't weaken, old man.

444
00:34:52,021 --> 00:34:53,306
That was our bargain.

445
00:34:54,065 --> 00:34:58,399
Emerson gets the 200,000,
and you get my copper mine.

446
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,561
My word for it, it'll make you rich.

447
00:35:01,322 --> 00:35:03,278
What are you going to do Cherry?

448
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,450
Do?

449
00:35:05,743 --> 00:35:07,984
I think I'll head back to Kalvik.

450
00:35:08,163 --> 00:35:10,074
This little scrap is just started.

451
00:35:10,748 --> 00:35:12,579
You may need someone who knows how to fight.

452
00:35:13,376 --> 00:35:14,786
Maybe fight dirty.

453
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:29,721
Hello Boyd.

454
00:35:36,816 --> 00:35:39,523
Pretty busy these
days, aren't you? How's it going?

455
00:35:39,694 --> 00:35:42,686
Oh, just great.
Machinery is all in, the traps are set.

456
00:35:42,864 --> 00:35:45,697
- It's up to the salmon now.
- The fish will keep their date.

457
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:47,983
Oh, I'm going to win this time Cherry.

458
00:35:48,161 --> 00:35:50,277
Sure you are for her.

459
00:35:50,455 --> 00:35:53,367
Oh, I've got to, for her.

460
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:58,418
Well, I have to be getting down
to the docks. I'll see you later.

461
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:37,790
You got to hand it to that kid.
They're working night and day.

462
00:36:37,961 --> 00:36:41,203
In only three weeks, he's got that old
cannery of balt is all ready for the run.

463
00:36:41,965 --> 00:36:44,547
- He's sure a hard worker.
- A lot of good that'll do him.

464
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,466
I'll stop Emerson if I have to...

465
00:36:48,972 --> 00:36:51,304
Remember what happened
to Boris Putman in Sitka, don't you?

466
00:36:51,474 --> 00:36:54,716
- We don't want no more killings.
- Don't worry. We won't have any.

467
00:37:07,949 --> 00:37:09,610
Alright. Lower away boys.

468
00:37:13,413 --> 00:37:14,413
Easy.

469
00:37:15,707 --> 00:37:16,707
Ok.

470
00:37:40,231 --> 00:37:42,938
I didn't think you had the nerve
to come to my camp.

471
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:44,974
It's only a friendly visit.

472
00:37:46,279 --> 00:37:49,771
- Once I offered you my advice.
- And I told you what you could do with it.

473
00:37:50,867 --> 00:37:52,198
So you did.

474
00:37:53,077 --> 00:37:54,442
But I'm patient.

475
00:37:56,122 --> 00:38:00,286
And I came to advise you to get out of
Alaska before you're shipped out...

476
00:38:01,544 --> 00:38:02,750
In a box.

477
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,208
You don't scare me a little bit.

478
00:38:08,259 --> 00:38:09,920
We don't like competition, you know.

479
00:38:13,431 --> 00:38:15,763
I've got some awfully good men.

480
00:38:16,809 --> 00:38:20,176
Well, before your men get me, I'll get you.

481
00:38:21,356 --> 00:38:24,143
I don't hire men to do my dirty work.

482
00:38:26,486 --> 00:38:27,566
No?

483
00:38:28,196 --> 00:38:30,562
It's a pity you haven't
the same scruples about women.

484
00:38:31,157 --> 00:38:34,866
That was a neat little trick you pulled
on Tom hilliard with a woman.

485
00:38:36,621 --> 00:38:38,782
You leave Mildred's name out of this.

486
00:38:38,956 --> 00:38:42,244
Mildred? I assure you
I wasn't thinking of her.

487
00:38:42,418 --> 00:38:43,937
Well, then what are you talking about?

488
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:45,792
Such a nuisance. Really, it's touching.

489
00:38:47,006 --> 00:38:48,667
I'm sorry you won't listen to reason.

490
00:38:50,468 --> 00:38:51,548
Too bad.

491
00:38:53,721 --> 00:38:54,881
Come on. Let's go.

492
00:39:06,943 --> 00:39:09,730
Look at that. There's a trap.

493
00:39:11,447 --> 00:39:12,732
Ain't that pretty?

494
00:39:15,326 --> 00:39:19,740
Well, all I can say is, a lot of trouble
to go to just for cans of salmon.

495
00:39:20,164 --> 00:39:21,745
Salmons is fine eatin...

496
00:39:24,168 --> 00:39:26,124
Guess you were never in the army.

497
00:39:44,856 --> 00:39:48,269
I picked this place because I know when
the salmons run, they'll come here.

498
00:39:49,235 --> 00:39:52,727
Think it's bad he talks to the fish.

499
00:39:56,909 --> 00:39:58,865
Now, marsh is going to make trouble.

500
00:39:59,036 --> 00:40:02,620
I figure he'll send out men with nets
to stop our salmon.

501
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:06,123
- Can he do that legally?
- Sure, he can. Legally.

502
00:40:06,294 --> 00:40:08,956
But we don't catch salmons with lawyers.

503
00:40:35,573 --> 00:40:37,655
Oh, there you are. Now wait a minute.

504
00:40:37,825 --> 00:40:40,567
By golly, I got some bad news.
My gang is quitting tonight.

505
00:40:40,745 --> 00:40:43,407
Quitting? They can't.
The salmon are coming any day.

506
00:40:43,581 --> 00:40:45,697
I know that but they quit just the same.

507
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:47,536
Mr. marsh promised more bigger wages.

508
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,496
But, we made a contract in Seattle.

509
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,626
Will I have to give you another licking?

510
00:40:51,798 --> 00:40:53,914
By golly, I think this time I'll lick you.

511
00:40:55,384 --> 00:40:58,717
But we don't fight.
Mr. marsh gives more money.

512
00:40:58,888 --> 00:41:01,174
What? You won't fight?

513
00:41:01,933 --> 00:41:03,264
Scared, eh?

514
00:41:03,434 --> 00:41:05,470
I always thought you was yellow.

515
00:41:05,645 --> 00:41:08,261
Won't fight like a man. Getting sissy.

516
00:41:08,439 --> 00:41:10,680
By golly, you can't
say those things. I fight.

517
00:41:10,858 --> 00:41:12,473
You hear that? I fight.

518
00:41:12,652 --> 00:41:14,768
This time I'll lick you
so you'll have a funeral.

519
00:41:14,946 --> 00:41:17,483
You poor, lopsided sausage.

520
00:41:17,657 --> 00:41:20,773
- Tonight?
- In the woods yonder?

521
00:41:20,952 --> 00:41:22,658
Soon as it's dark.

522
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:31,952
Now, don't you worry.
They've got to work if I lick svenson.

523
00:41:32,129 --> 00:41:33,710
And I'll beat the ears off him.

524
00:41:33,881 --> 00:41:37,089
Sure. Svenson won't last more than an hour.

525
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:41,424
Look here, balt. I won't let anybody
fight my battles for me, understand?

526
00:41:41,597 --> 00:41:45,055
Now you let me handle that
lop-eared slant head.

527
00:41:45,726 --> 00:41:47,842
Quit, eh? I'll show them.

528
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,227
Either I fight him
or there won't be any fight.

529
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:54,269
Say...

530
00:41:59,949 --> 00:42:01,610
Good, hard muscles.

531
00:42:02,493 --> 00:42:03,699
Big too.

532
00:42:04,704 --> 00:42:06,865
But, ah, you don't know how to fight dirty.

533
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:08,279
Well, I'll fight him fair.

534
00:42:09,417 --> 00:42:11,032
Svenson? Fair?

535
00:42:16,507 --> 00:42:19,999
Maybe. Maybe I could learn you enough.

536
00:43:01,677 --> 00:43:03,677
Who do you think is
going to win that fight, eh?

537
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:08,552
Hey, balt, you got my white meat ready?

538
00:43:08,726 --> 00:43:11,559
Listen, you tripe eating old he goat.

539
00:43:11,729 --> 00:43:13,811
There ain't going to be
enough left of you to plant.

540
00:43:13,981 --> 00:43:15,812
You better kiss him goodbye.

541
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,608
I'll kiss you,
you goggle-eyed galoot, with a hatch.

542
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:23,354
- Ready kid?
- Turn him loose.

543
00:43:23,532 --> 00:43:25,068
Don't forget the lead fist.

544
00:43:45,763 --> 00:43:47,403
Punch, punch, punch, punch, punch.

545
00:43:48,182 --> 00:43:49,547
Come on, get him.

546
00:44:01,737 --> 00:44:03,147
Get up, brother. Come on.

547
00:44:19,547 --> 00:44:20,662
Oh.

548
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:31,930
Get him, svenson. Come on.

549
00:44:35,855 --> 00:44:37,345
Dial in that lead fist.

550
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,810
Beat him up.

551
00:44:45,948 --> 00:44:48,690
Go ahead, kill him. Kill him.

552
00:45:09,346 --> 00:45:11,587
Come on. Come on. Put her there boy.

553
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,437
Oh.

554
00:45:20,608 --> 00:45:22,519
Hit him back. Hit him back.

555
00:45:25,863 --> 00:45:27,023
Tear that crab down.

556
00:45:31,702 --> 00:45:36,446
- Here's your winner.
- You win. By golly, you're a good fighter.

557
00:45:58,896 --> 00:46:00,511
Why did you do it Boyd?

558
00:46:02,358 --> 00:46:05,191
Can't let anybody else fight my battles.

559
00:47:03,377 --> 00:47:05,413
Balt. Balt.

560
00:47:05,588 --> 00:47:07,920
The salmon are in. They're in the traps.

561
00:47:08,424 --> 00:47:10,506
You heard him. Look alive. Everybody.

562
00:47:10,843 --> 00:47:12,174
My salmons are in.

563
00:47:12,928 --> 00:47:14,964
Fishermen on the pier.

564
00:47:15,139 --> 00:47:18,097
Salmons are in. Take in the traps.

565
00:47:18,267 --> 00:47:20,804
Roll out, you scroungy loafers.

566
00:47:20,978 --> 00:47:23,060
Pete. Salmons are in.

567
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:26,142
Salmons. Salmons.

568
00:47:26,317 --> 00:47:27,317
Head out.

569
00:47:28,569 --> 00:47:30,434
Come on. Get your salmons.

570
00:47:30,613 --> 00:47:32,729
Hey. Get that tack ready down there.

571
00:50:14,068 --> 00:50:15,068
Eh?

572
00:50:18,364 --> 00:50:24,530
I still think it's a lot of trouble to go
through just for canned salmon.

573
00:51:48,328 --> 00:51:51,128
And don't think I'm stopped because
Emerson whipped that idiot svenson.

574
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:53,155
I haven't played my last card.

575
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:55,687
Got you dealing off the bottom
of the deck though, haven't they?

576
00:51:55,711 --> 00:51:58,168
I came here to give you fair warning.

577
00:51:59,965 --> 00:52:01,546
And I'm giving it right back to you.

578
00:52:01,717 --> 00:52:05,130
You lay off the boy, marsh.
Give him a chance.

579
00:52:06,513 --> 00:52:07,969
I'm giving him a chance,

580
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:11,052
and I'm giving you a chance
to clear out before I run you out.

581
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:13,926
We're not leaving.

582
00:52:15,189 --> 00:52:18,397
Very well. You've made your choice.

583
00:52:19,693 --> 00:52:23,982
If that trap is operating tomorrow,
I'll send out my boats and wreck it.

584
00:52:25,866 --> 00:52:28,403
That means someone will be killed, marsh.

585
00:52:30,162 --> 00:52:32,904
You know, that's exactly what I was thinking.

586
00:52:57,648 --> 00:52:59,013
Well, I gave them their chance.

587
00:52:59,733 --> 00:53:00,973
Send out the boats.

588
00:53:01,151 --> 00:53:02,812
Send them out. Do as I tell you.

589
00:53:23,215 --> 00:53:27,003
It's marsh's fleet. I knew he'd try it.

590
00:53:27,177 --> 00:53:28,633
Svenson. Get the men in a boat.

591
00:53:28,804 --> 00:53:31,295
Hey men. I got to be beat by a marsh.

592
00:53:46,071 --> 00:53:47,991
Let's get out of here.

593
00:53:50,492 --> 00:53:51,607
All ahead boys.

594
00:53:54,913 --> 00:53:55,913
Come on.

595
00:54:28,572 --> 00:54:29,687
That's Wayland's yacht.

596
00:54:34,161 --> 00:54:37,403
I'm going aboard. Get word
to our men out there to come ashore.

597
00:55:06,693 --> 00:55:08,274
Interesting, right?

598
00:55:08,445 --> 00:55:10,436
I wonder what the beggars are brawling about.

599
00:55:10,947 --> 00:55:13,108
Primitive and all that, isn't it?

600
00:55:13,283 --> 00:55:16,150
What does it signify, Wayne?
Blessed if I know.

601
00:55:16,328 --> 00:55:18,535
But I see Fred marsh
coming out in the launch.

602
00:55:18,705 --> 00:55:20,241
He'll explain, no doubt.

603
00:55:52,197 --> 00:55:53,562
Here you are.

604
00:56:31,069 --> 00:56:33,731
Come back and fight, you, you...

605
00:56:35,282 --> 00:56:37,523
You darn afraid cats.

606
00:56:41,955 --> 00:56:45,322
I guess that'll learn you.
You yellow monkeys.

607
00:56:47,544 --> 00:56:49,500
Hey, where's the kid?

608
00:56:49,671 --> 00:56:51,081
- Emerson?
- Yeah.

609
00:56:51,256 --> 00:56:52,792
He went over to that yacht.

610
00:56:54,217 --> 00:56:55,673
What's he coming up here for?

611
00:56:55,844 --> 00:56:57,380
You can't come on this boat, bud.

612
00:56:57,554 --> 00:56:59,449
- Come on. Get out.
- You can't get on this boat.

613
00:56:59,473 --> 00:57:01,179
Get off.

614
00:57:03,185 --> 00:57:04,675
What's the meaning of this, Emerson?

615
00:57:04,853 --> 00:57:07,014
I'd think you'd have the decency
not to come here.

616
00:57:07,814 --> 00:57:09,520
See here sir. You can't...

617
00:57:09,691 --> 00:57:11,647
Please Boyd. Not here.

618
00:57:11,818 --> 00:57:13,979
I wish to speak with Boyd, father.

619
00:57:14,154 --> 00:57:15,269
Alone.

620
00:57:22,871 --> 00:57:24,452
But what's happened dearest?

621
00:57:24,623 --> 00:57:26,705
I think you might better tell me that.

622
00:57:27,209 --> 00:57:30,622
Brawling like a street tough.
Attacking Fred Marsh's men.

623
00:57:30,796 --> 00:57:32,377
Did marsh tell you that?

624
00:57:32,547 --> 00:57:35,067
- And did you believe him?
- I believe what I choose to believe.

625
00:57:35,175 --> 00:57:38,167
About this and about the woman
with whom you are so,

626
00:57:38,345 --> 00:57:40,256
well, friendly, to be polite about it.

627
00:57:41,264 --> 00:57:42,845
I mean Cherry Malotte.

628
00:57:43,266 --> 00:57:45,097
Cherry? But she's...

629
00:57:45,268 --> 00:57:48,010
Everything sweet and refined and decent,
I suppose.

630
00:57:48,188 --> 00:57:50,028
Perhaps that's why
you never told me about her.

631
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:52,772
Why, I didn't think you'd be interested.

632
00:57:52,943 --> 00:57:54,979
Rather lame Boyd.

633
00:57:55,153 --> 00:57:56,768
But I found out about her.

634
00:57:56,947 --> 00:57:59,905
How you brought her back with you.
How you sent her to hilliard.

635
00:58:00,075 --> 00:58:03,067
- You know that's not true, Mildred.
- Pretty shabby, wasn't it?

636
00:58:03,245 --> 00:58:06,032
And such a woman. A hanger-on in men's camps.

637
00:58:06,206 --> 00:58:07,206
That's a lie.

638
00:58:07,624 --> 00:58:10,411
You choose to call me a liar to defend...

639
00:58:10,585 --> 00:58:12,917
It's lies, I tell you. Cherry is my friend.

640
00:58:13,797 --> 00:58:17,210
I rather gathered that. A very dear friend.

641
00:58:17,384 --> 00:58:20,126
So very dear that you came to me
from her arms.

642
00:58:20,303 --> 00:58:22,143
I won't let you
say things like that about her.

643
00:58:22,305 --> 00:58:24,011
I'll bring her here. She'll tell you.

644
00:58:24,182 --> 00:58:26,924
Do you think, really,
I'd be interested in the type?

645
00:58:27,102 --> 00:58:29,058
Meanwhile, of course, our engagement.

646
00:58:29,229 --> 00:58:31,595
Mildred. Mildred, you don't mean that.

647
00:58:32,274 --> 00:58:34,014
You can't.

648
00:58:40,532 --> 00:58:42,193
- Where is she?
- She went away.

649
00:58:42,367 --> 00:58:44,483
Don't lie to me. Where is she? Where she go?

650
00:58:44,661 --> 00:58:47,323
She went away last night
in a boat with clamion.

651
00:58:54,588 --> 00:58:55,588
Come on in.

652
00:59:04,514 --> 00:59:07,096
Tell me the truth about Cherry
or I'll choke it out of you.

653
00:59:07,851 --> 00:59:09,057
Sure, it's true.

654
00:59:11,229 --> 00:59:12,229
What of it?

655
00:59:12,939 --> 00:59:15,180
Does that keep her
from being a regular fella?

656
00:59:16,985 --> 00:59:18,475
That kind of a woman.

657
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:22,403
Cherry is all right.
They don't make them no better.

658
00:59:23,408 --> 00:59:24,898
And I never knew.

659
00:59:28,371 --> 00:59:31,408
Oh, no. You never knew.

660
00:59:31,583 --> 00:59:34,791
I don't suppose you even knew why hilliard
give you that money all of a sudden.

661
00:59:34,961 --> 00:59:36,121
Did she really do that?

662
00:59:36,296 --> 00:59:37,832
Don't tell me you didn't...

663
00:59:39,758 --> 00:59:41,419
Why, we all knew that.

664
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:43,716
Even balt.

665
00:59:45,555 --> 00:59:48,679
Cherry went to hilliard and, well...

666
00:59:49,768 --> 00:59:52,054
The next day you got the dough, didn't you?

667
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:09,034
I certainly don't savvy all this fuss
over a few cans of fish.

668
01:00:17,087 --> 01:00:20,045
And dragging me
all the way down here from Nome.

669
01:00:21,925 --> 01:00:23,916
And you ain't told me yet what for.

670
01:00:24,094 --> 01:00:26,836
Don't you worry, Queenie.
I'll tell you in plenty of time.

671
01:00:27,472 --> 01:00:29,258
I hope it's something exciting.

672
01:00:29,432 --> 01:00:31,172
It'll be exciting, all right.

673
01:00:31,351 --> 01:00:33,967
It should be after that long trip.

674
01:00:39,317 --> 01:00:42,024
- Just like old times, ain't it?
- You bet, Queenie.

675
01:00:42,487 --> 01:00:44,398
Only you never used to smoke cigarettes.

676
01:00:45,156 --> 01:00:49,240
Oh, I'm going to the dog something terrible.

677
01:00:51,663 --> 01:00:53,028
Going to have company?

678
01:00:53,915 --> 01:00:56,577
Ain't that nice?

679
01:01:05,427 --> 01:01:07,213
One of the local girls Cherry?

680
01:01:12,726 --> 01:01:14,762
High-told wench, ain't she?

681
01:01:16,521 --> 01:01:19,012
Private, eh? Oh, excuse me.

682
01:01:28,742 --> 01:01:31,028
Queenie is one of my old friends from Nome.

683
01:01:31,202 --> 01:01:32,817
Quite a type, isn't she?

684
01:01:33,913 --> 01:01:34,913
Isn't she, though?

685
01:01:36,833 --> 01:01:37,833
Have a cigarette?

686
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:41,876
I want to talk with you.

687
01:01:42,714 --> 01:01:44,921
Well? Go ahead.

688
01:01:45,091 --> 01:01:47,298
We both speak the same language.

689
01:01:47,469 --> 01:01:50,802
Just a couple of dames
in love with the same fellow.

690
01:01:50,972 --> 01:01:52,462
Then you are in love with him.

691
01:01:53,558 --> 01:01:54,889
I might as well go.

692
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:58,597
I can't use the same methods
you use to hold him.

693
01:01:58,772 --> 01:02:00,057
Why not?

694
01:02:00,231 --> 01:02:02,768
Something in your book of etiquette
about that too?

695
01:02:03,735 --> 01:02:05,976
When I love a man, I don't need any rules.

696
01:02:06,154 --> 01:02:07,485
Obviously.

697
01:02:07,655 --> 01:02:08,940
I shouldn't have come.

698
01:02:09,616 --> 01:02:11,607
I might have known your sort.

699
01:02:12,118 --> 01:02:14,074
You don't have to put me in my place.

700
01:02:14,245 --> 01:02:18,488
I know about me. Just like Queenie,
only I managed to get a better break.

701
01:02:18,666 --> 01:02:20,281
I'm not interested in your confession.

702
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,416
Not a confession. It's a boast.

703
01:02:22,587 --> 01:02:25,454
- You can have Boyd Emerson for all of me.
- Oh, no, I can't.

704
01:02:25,632 --> 01:02:29,090
Boyd could never forgive me for
being, well, for being Cherry Malotte.

705
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:30,375
Can you blame him?

706
01:02:30,553 --> 01:02:32,839
No men being what they are.

707
01:02:33,014 --> 01:02:35,721
And women of a certain type
being what they are.

708
01:02:36,726 --> 01:02:40,469
You don't know my sort,
but I can see through you like a window.

709
01:02:40,647 --> 01:02:42,808
And not such a clean window at that.

710
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,360
Let me go.

711
01:02:46,444 --> 01:02:48,526
You'll listen Sister and you'll like it.

712
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:50,770
Let me out.

713
01:02:55,537 --> 01:02:57,073
I love Boyd.

714
01:02:57,247 --> 01:02:59,829
I'm not ashamed of it.
There's nothing to be ashamed of,

715
01:02:59,999 --> 01:03:03,162
no matter what you think in
that dirty little mind of yours.

716
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,879
If I'd wanted to hold him that way,
you'd never have seen him again.

717
01:03:08,049 --> 01:03:12,292
I don't want to see him again.
I won't take him from you.

718
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:15,337
You'll take him because
you've been taking things all your life.

719
01:03:15,515 --> 01:03:19,349
- I offered to share everything with him.
- Sure, you have.

720
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:22,727
There's a name for the man who'd
take that kind of money from a woman.

721
01:03:22,897 --> 01:03:26,355
And you lied to him. Let him believe
you fixed that loan with hilliard.

722
01:03:26,943 --> 01:03:31,186
You mean to tell me that he didn't know
you did that? And how you did it?

723
01:03:32,365 --> 01:03:33,980
You talk to me like that?

724
01:03:34,784 --> 01:03:36,115
You, why, you...

725
01:03:37,954 --> 01:03:39,285
Oh, don't be scared.

726
01:03:40,331 --> 01:03:41,946
I won't dirty my hands on you.

727
01:03:43,626 --> 01:03:47,995
I'm Cherry Malotte. They know about me
from San Francisco to Sitka.

728
01:03:48,173 --> 01:03:51,336
My reputation is got marks on it
I couldn't rub off if I wanted to.

729
01:03:51,509 --> 01:03:53,670
I am what I am.

730
01:03:53,845 --> 01:03:56,606
I don't know how they finally
settle things in this world or the next.

731
01:03:56,639 --> 01:03:57,639
But when the day comes,

732
01:03:57,765 --> 01:04:00,381
I'll stand there with my chin up
and take what's coming to me.

733
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,346
And I wouldn't trade places with you,

734
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,602
you white-livered, sweet-smelling hypocrite,

735
01:04:04,772 --> 01:04:07,058
if they gave me a one-way ticket to hell.

736
01:04:07,775 --> 01:04:09,481
Now get out of here.

737
01:04:09,652 --> 01:04:12,860
I'll send him to you and I hope you're
as happy as you deserve to be. Get out.

738
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:26,871
Don't you start shooting off your lips.

739
01:04:56,991 --> 01:04:58,322
You're all in kid.

740
01:04:59,577 --> 01:05:01,818
You know we've been at it 30 hours straight?

741
01:05:01,996 --> 01:05:03,076
Get to your bunk.

742
01:05:04,374 --> 01:05:05,864
Not while you're still working.

743
01:05:06,668 --> 01:05:08,659
I'm quitting in an hour myself.

744
01:05:09,295 --> 01:05:11,035
Better turn in. You need it.

745
01:05:11,714 --> 01:05:12,714
Go on.

746
01:05:58,845 --> 01:06:00,460
Looks kind of drunk, don't he?

747
01:06:12,483 --> 01:06:16,772
Don't touch me. Do you know
what they're saying about you? About me?

748
01:06:16,946 --> 01:06:17,946
I can guess.

749
01:06:18,573 --> 01:06:20,279
It's not true Cherry.

750
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:22,987
- Tell me it's not true.
- It's true, all right.

751
01:06:24,454 --> 01:06:27,446
I thought you knew.
Everybody knows about Cherry Malotte.

752
01:06:27,623 --> 01:06:30,490
Do you think if I'd known
that I'd have accepted your help?

753
01:06:30,668 --> 01:06:32,954
Why not?
I didn't ask you any questions, did I,

754
01:06:33,129 --> 01:06:35,245
when you came here broke and ready to quit?

755
01:06:35,423 --> 01:06:37,109
- You weren't so fussy then either.
- Well, it's got...

756
01:06:37,133 --> 01:06:38,669
It's not too late.

757
01:06:38,843 --> 01:06:41,004
- Go back to her.
- She won't have me.

758
01:06:41,179 --> 01:06:42,965
Not since she knows about you.

759
01:06:43,139 --> 01:06:45,505
- She's going to marry marsh.
- No, she's not.

760
01:06:45,683 --> 01:06:47,890
She'll forgive you. I know Boyd.

761
01:06:48,061 --> 01:06:51,849
You know. What can a woman of your kind
know about her?

762
01:06:52,023 --> 01:06:54,730
- You...
- Let's not start calling names.

763
01:06:54,901 --> 01:06:57,734
- I'm just a little tired myself.
- Oh, you don't want names, eh?

764
01:06:57,904 --> 01:07:01,271
The truth hurts, doesn't it?
I'll name a few names.

765
01:07:01,449 --> 01:07:04,782
You're nothing but a dirty, lying little...

766
01:07:04,952 --> 01:07:06,112
That's what you are.

767
01:07:16,089 --> 01:07:18,671
Well, you certainly named
a few names, all right.

768
01:07:20,635 --> 01:07:22,796
And I could have loved you.

769
01:07:30,269 --> 01:07:31,384
Could you Boyd?

770
01:07:41,739 --> 01:07:43,275
Don't touch me.

771
01:07:43,449 --> 01:07:46,737
Yes, I could have loved you.
That's the kind of a fool I've been.

772
01:07:46,911 --> 01:07:49,823
Thinking you were a pal.
Helping me find myself.

773
01:07:49,997 --> 01:07:53,910
I found myself, all right.
And I found out about you.

774
01:07:54,085 --> 01:07:55,950
You've killed every hope I've had.

775
01:07:56,129 --> 01:07:58,165
You lied to me. You cheated me.

776
01:07:58,339 --> 01:07:59,624
Why, I ought to...

777
01:08:17,483 --> 01:08:19,223
Noisy fella, ain't he?

778
01:08:20,111 --> 01:08:21,111
Been drinking?

779
01:08:26,701 --> 01:08:28,862
He ain't worth crying about honey.

780
01:08:29,036 --> 01:08:30,196
No guy is.

781
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:32,786
No, I guess not.

782
01:08:33,624 --> 01:08:35,580
But knowing that doesn't help much, does it?

783
01:08:37,086 --> 01:08:38,997
And the funny part is, of course...

784
01:08:40,423 --> 01:08:42,038
He's really in love with you.

785
01:08:43,426 --> 01:08:45,007
Did you hear what he called me?

786
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:51,298
Say, I'd rather have the guy I love talk
to me like that and think he meant it,

787
01:08:51,893 --> 01:08:55,886
than talk refined and poetic
and know he didn't.

788
01:08:57,857 --> 01:08:59,313
He meant it, all right.

789
01:09:00,401 --> 01:09:02,562
If he wasn't crazy about you,

790
01:09:02,737 --> 01:09:05,979
would he go to all that trouble
to tell you how much he hates you?

791
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:10,525
It's true though.

792
01:09:12,371 --> 01:09:15,033
If you weren't so stuck on him,
you'd see it in a minute.

793
01:09:21,923 --> 01:09:23,834
Oh, us girls.

794
01:09:48,616 --> 01:09:50,857
May I suggest an explanation madam?

795
01:09:51,035 --> 01:09:54,027
You're going to get it mister,
and don't call me madam.

796
01:09:54,205 --> 01:09:56,321
And that ain't all you're going to get daddy.

797
01:09:57,166 --> 01:09:58,997
I apologize to all of you.

798
01:09:59,168 --> 01:10:01,955
There's been a misunderstanding,
and I'm afraid it's mostly my fault.

799
01:10:02,129 --> 01:10:04,791
- But I'm going to square it.
- Don't weaken kid.

800
01:10:05,508 --> 01:10:08,215
I'm told miss wayland
is engaged to Fred marsh.

801
01:10:08,386 --> 01:10:10,377
And I just want to tell you that she isn't.

802
01:10:11,264 --> 01:10:14,677
- She can't marry him because...
- It's a lie. It's a rotten frame-up.

803
01:10:15,142 --> 01:10:17,929
Why Freddy darling, how you talk.

804
01:10:18,104 --> 01:10:21,221
You see, marsh is already
married to Queenie here.

805
01:10:22,358 --> 01:10:25,646
Why, I never saw her before in my life.
I tell you, it's blackmail.

806
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:27,685
Better straighten this out, marsh.

807
01:10:28,781 --> 01:10:29,781
Why, I...

808
01:10:32,326 --> 01:10:33,941
I thought she was dead.

809
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:37,362
You mean you wished I was dead. But I ain't.

810
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:39,906
And I've got the marriage certificate
and everything.

811
01:10:40,835 --> 01:10:44,623
Of course, such things can happen,
but not to my daughter.

812
01:10:49,176 --> 01:10:51,417
I'm sorry I had to do this this way.

813
01:10:52,597 --> 01:10:54,007
Be good to him, won't you?

814
01:10:54,932 --> 01:10:57,594
You're very certain,
aren't you, that I'll have him?

815
01:10:59,687 --> 01:11:03,095
Just two dames, stuck on the same fellow.

816
01:11:04,317 --> 01:11:05,773
I'll send him out to you.

817
01:11:06,819 --> 01:11:08,355
Don't let him go again.

818
01:11:10,031 --> 01:11:11,031
Goodbye.

819
01:11:12,742 --> 01:11:15,905
Imagine, Freddy marsh married to that girl.

820
01:11:16,662 --> 01:11:18,118
I can hardly believe it.

821
01:11:30,593 --> 01:11:31,628
Hold it fella.

822
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:34,679
Cherry.

823
01:11:38,851 --> 01:11:41,433
Let me go. Let me go, I tell you.
I got to find Cherry.

824
01:11:41,604 --> 01:11:45,536
- You found her once and you were a fool.
- I know I've been a fool.

825
01:11:45,606 --> 01:11:47,790
You ain't going to hurt her again, you hear?

826
01:11:48,653 --> 01:11:50,644
A bad woman? Cherry?

827
01:11:50,821 --> 01:11:53,403
Oh, she's worth ten like you.

828
01:11:53,574 --> 01:11:57,817
You want to go somewhere, eh?
Well, go. Go hide your head.

829
01:11:58,537 --> 01:12:02,621
Go to that pale-faced,
namby-pamby girl out there in the yacht.

830
01:12:03,167 --> 01:12:05,909
She's your kind. You don't deserve no better.

831
01:12:06,087 --> 01:12:08,703
- But, balt.
- Don't talk to me. I'm through with you.

832
01:12:08,881 --> 01:12:11,418
Oh baby. What a blow-off.

833
01:12:11,592 --> 01:12:15,676
Cherry is out on the yacht,
and she's gave Marsh the old run around.

834
01:12:15,846 --> 01:12:19,509
Say, listen. Let us speak, will you?

835
01:12:19,684 --> 01:12:21,549
Marsh is leaving town and...

836
01:12:24,188 --> 01:12:25,188
Say, listen.

837
01:12:27,233 --> 01:12:28,439
Well, what the...

838
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,565
That's Marsh's boat, ain't it?

839
01:12:37,868 --> 01:12:40,109
Where is she? He told me she was here.

840
01:12:40,287 --> 01:12:41,652
Here I am Boyd.

841
01:12:42,248 --> 01:12:45,866
Waiting. Oh Boyd. Dear dear Boyd.

842
01:12:46,043 --> 01:12:48,284
Let's forget what happened. I understand.

843
01:12:48,462 --> 01:12:50,293
You still believe that Cherry and I...

844
01:12:50,464 --> 01:12:53,456
Oh, she'll forget too.
That kind forgets easily. Some other man...

845
01:12:53,634 --> 01:12:56,216
No, you don't understand.
I don't think you'll ever understand.

846
01:12:56,387 --> 01:13:00,346
Don't talk Boyd. Just take me
in your arms. I'll forgive everything.

847
01:13:00,516 --> 01:13:02,507
She's the one I've got to ask to forgive.

848
01:13:02,685 --> 01:13:04,892
- Put your arms around me Boyd.
- The yacht is moving.

849
01:13:05,062 --> 01:13:07,053
Oh. We're going home.

850
01:13:08,649 --> 01:13:11,231
Boyd, you can't leave me. I won't let you.

851
01:13:14,572 --> 01:13:17,154
You'll sit tight and keep your eye
on that Emerson outfit.

852
01:13:17,324 --> 01:13:19,781
I'm only dropping down the coast
till this blows over.

853
01:13:21,245 --> 01:13:22,576
Shove off, you pig.

854
01:13:33,841 --> 01:13:35,297
Now what's the matter?

855
01:13:48,814 --> 01:13:54,605
Excuse me please Mr.marsh.

856
01:14:05,748 --> 01:14:07,204
Cheer up honey.

857
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:09,160
You'll get over it.

858
01:14:10,544 --> 01:14:11,909
Sure, I'll get over it.

859
01:14:16,258 --> 01:14:17,258
Boyd.

860
01:14:23,933 --> 01:14:24,933
Boyd.

861
01:14:37,446 --> 01:14:42,254
- It's because you're sorry for me.
- Sorry? For you?

862
01:14:43,577 --> 01:14:45,192
Oh, forgive me Cherry.

863
01:14:45,996 --> 01:14:48,408
There's no past, no yesterday.

864
01:14:49,291 --> 01:14:52,033
Only tomorrow and tomorrow.

865
01:14:53,671 --> 01:14:57,539
Oh Cherry, I love you so.
