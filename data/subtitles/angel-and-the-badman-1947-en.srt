1
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,700
Give me that horse.

2
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,300
He couldn't go on
nor could you.

3
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,200
You're injured man.
Let us take you into the house.

4
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,900
I gotta go on. Gotta get to
the Telegraph station.

5
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,700
We'll take you.
Penelope!

6
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,400
Sorry, closed down for the night.

7
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,000
I know, but this is urgent...

8
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,400
No. Come out of there, you!

9
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,400
Can't go against the schedule.
Closed down.

10
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
Can't you make this one exception?
- No.

11
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,800
Get in here.
- What?

12
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,000
Bring a light with you.

13
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You can't do this to me.
I won't stand for it!

14
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,200
The Union Pacific
won't stand for it.

15
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
Night prowling round here,
like this.

16
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,000
You've got your gall busting
into my office.

17
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,600
Who do you think you're anyway?
My keys closed down for tonight.

18
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,000
You can write it,
but I won't send it anyway.

19
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,400
Here let me!

20
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,300
<i>Territorial Recorders office,
Fort Lacey.</i>

21
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,950
<i>have filed corner stakes...</i>

22
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,300
<i>...on plots 234... 235.</i>

23
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,200
<i>Chart 1089,
record in my name...</i>

24
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,200
...that's all.
- How shall I sign it?

25
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,900
<i>Quirt Evans.</i>

26
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
All sent, Mr. Evans.

27
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Why! He ain't dead, is he?

28
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,900
No just knocked out!

29
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,600
That's Quirt Evans...

30
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,600
Look at his gun, see how many
notches he has got in his gun?

31
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,900
Not any that I can see.
Sure ain't going to touch it to find out

32
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,800
might wake up and
take it the wrong way.

33
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,100
he was deputy of Wyatt Earp
in Tombstone.

34
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,100
...the two of them shot it out
with the whole Clanton bunch.

35
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,800
So, that's Quirt Evans...

36
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,000
...he's quite a man
with the gals...

37
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,200
.it says he closed the eyes
of many a man

38
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,300
...opened the eyes
of many a women.

39
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,400
Would you call
my father please?

40
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,900
Yes! ma'am...

41
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,200
Where are you taking him?
- To the wagon, to take him home.

42
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,800
Quirt Evans?
Crazy!

43
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,100
I'd just a soon have a black powder
bomb in my house.

44
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,300
Heavy, ain't he?

45
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,000
I know of a dozen men
who'd ride night and day

46
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
...to catch Quirt Evans
helpless like this.

47
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,900
I'm worried about you people...

48
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,200
...I know you don't believe in guns or
anything like that, only doing good.

49
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,800
Take my advice...

50
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,600
I'd stay plenty far away
from Mr. Quirt Evans.

51
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Thank you very much for your advice.
Goodnight.

52
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,000
Good night.

53
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,400
So long, Quirt.

54
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,300
That Quirt Evans
is surely something.

55
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,200
Quirt Evans?
You know him?

56
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,200
Do I know Quirt Evans?
Do I know Quirt Evans!

57
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,600
What a question!

58
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,700
Quirt: No... No...

59
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,500
If that doesn't quiet him...
I don't know what will?

60
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,600
...never get that bullet out of him
kicking around like that.

61
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,900
I'm afraid to give him any more sedative,
he has already had enough.

62
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,500
Please be quiet...
the doctor...

63
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,000
He can't hear you.

64
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,300
What do you suppose that
delirious mind is searching for?

65
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,200
He must be in great pain
- Not with that much laudanum in him.

66
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,800
As if he was reaching for something.
Something specific.

67
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,300
I don't understand. By now he
should be completely inert.

68
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Quirt: No.

69
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,000
Thomas, how is the young man?
- Delirious.

70
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,900
A gun in this house, Thomas?

71
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,500
Please put these back in the gun belt...

72
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,800
Maybe we'll have to get something
to tie him down.

73
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,900
Are you crazy?
- It's empty.

74
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,300
That was it. A Gun.
- It's a pity.

75
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,500
It's stupid! These wild ones
I keep picking bullets out of them,

76
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,000
...and setting their bones, why?

77
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,800
It's their destiny to wind up on boot hill.

78
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,000
No!

79
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,600
I forgot! Never speak evil, Eh!

80
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,200
Well, get me some more hot water
young lady.

81
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,900
Start patching him up for
whatever is in store for him.

82
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,700
Come on, help me with his boots.

83
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,500
Mother...
- Yes?

84
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,500
Tell me again.

85
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,500
What Dear?
- Oh, about meeting father?

86
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,800
Thee have heard that
a thousand times.

87
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,900
He was working on the roof of
the new meeting house.

88
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,900
...he fell off, and I picked him up
out of the dust and held him in my arms.

89
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,300
He always said that I hugged him
before I even knew his name.

90
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,500
And you both knew right away?
- Of course.

91
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Of course I knew he
was a peaceful man....

92
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,900
...a member of the society.

93
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,600
An evil man will seek a more profitable
way of life

94
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,100
...than being a member
of the <i>"Friends"</i>.

95
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,100
Father, had a beard then, didn't he?
- Yes.

96
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,500
I should think that
would scratch...

97
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,700
I prefer a man clean shaved.

98
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,400
He's got the constitution of a
mountain lion. He'll pull through.

99
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,600
Barring blood poisoning.

100
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,700
These wild ones never seem
to get blood poisoning...

101
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,100
...though it's common enough
among the Godly.

102
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,500
You so called Atheists. You always feel
so compelled to stretch your Godlessness.

103
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,700
Wash him.
The bullet's out.

104
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,100
He's in no danger.

105
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,800
I bet he killed a lot of people.
- No, he didn't.

106
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
How do thee know?
- That's enough, John...

107
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,200
...a <i>"friend"</i> doesn't speak
of such things.

108
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,100
Mrs. Worth, get that
man out of here.

109
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,900
But he's badly injured,
doctor.

110
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,700
This isn't civilized Pennsylvania...

111
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,200
...this is the raw frontier.
You must take a realistic attitude.

112
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,400
This is the place where mayhem, theft
and murder are the common place...

113
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,800
...instead of the unusual.

114
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,200
Would that justify leaving
a wounded man to die?

115
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,000
Build you house by the side of the road
and be a friend to man.

116
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,600
Ye who believe.

117
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,200
I don't mind your mocking us,
you've been a good friend to us.

118
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm glad I have
a logical mind.

119
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,700
And a good heart.
Goodnight, doctor.

120
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,000
Goodnight.

121
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,000
Still having delirious spells.
Keeps mumbling about his past.

122
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,100
...I'm afraid he's had
a very violent life.

123
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,100
[Quirt mumbling]:
Cards...

124
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,100
...cover my bet on the black ace...

125
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,100
...you're a shapely hussy...

126
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,100
...you get real conformation, Margaret...

127
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
...you fill out that dress just right...

128
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
...red's your color...

129
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,600
...alright Margaret...

130
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,000
...chart 1089...

131
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,000
...1089...

132
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,100
...Margaret you're a nuisance!
Let's call it off, Margaret...

133
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,100
...I've got places to go and
country to put behind...

134
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,300
...sure, sure, alright...

135
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,520
...Lila... Lila...

136
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
...Lila..

137
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:12,800
...if I owned a mint...
put your head on every coin...

138
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,800
...I use to smoke corn silk
when I was a kid...

139
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,800
...your hair is just like that, Lila...

140
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,800
...lite brown, yellow all mixed up...
just like corn silk, Lila...

141
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,800
...all gold...
taunt...

142
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,500
Will you bring some
hot coffee, Penny?

143
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,300
Here the doctor says that he's
completely out of danger.

144
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,700
Just sleeping
You know Doctor...

145
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,800
...Penny considers him her
own personal patient.

146
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,800
Sit down.

147
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,300
Will you bring some milk dear?

148
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,100
And when you finish you can
go up and watch him...

149
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,600
while you card your
wool on the loon.

150
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,500
He doesn't need watching. He has no
temperature in the past few days.

151
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,900
...just a superlatively healthy animal.

152
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,770
...restoring his depleted strength with
sleep. He's no longer delirious.

153
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,630
But of course, if you're determined
to watch over him, Penny...

154
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,900
...perhaps you better take a
pencil and paper with you.

155
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,130
...his first conscious words
should be recorded.

156
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,830
It may be of great interest
to history.

157
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,090
And more possibly to
the United States Marshal.

158
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:25,190
Who knows what violence is involved
with his battered frame and bullet holes.

159
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,070
Would you care for a donut, doctor?

160
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,350
They're not as light as it should be.
- Listen Mrs. Worth...

161
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,430
...you can carry this
head in sand attitude

162
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,430
just so far in the
world of reality.

163
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,900
...let me get this man
out of your house.

164
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,180
I can dump him in an establishment
that passes for a hotel.

165
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,620
...in this off times dubious
community of ours.

166
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,600
In Madame Sanitary hobble?
- Then he will be off your hands.

167
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,500
But he's much better off here
- Of course he's.

168
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,700
Who cares what happens to him?
- We do

169
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,000
I don't know what to say?

170
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,900
Once when I was studying
medicine in Europe...

171
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,700
...I had a friend,
an artist.

172
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,800
He drew portrait's of people
and made them...

173
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,800
resemble the animals
they reminded him of.

174
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,500
He would have drawn this man
as a coiled cobra.

175
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,700
Doctor, your analogies terribly imperfect
and your naturalism faulted.

176
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,300
Cobras don't coil

177
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,100
Doctor, we are so fond of thee
and we respect you so greatly.

178
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,500
We assured that you
will finally realize...

179
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,100
...that realism untempered by
sentiments of humanity

180
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,600
...is really just a mean hard cold
outlook on life.

181
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,300
A frightened outlook.

182
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,600
I stand defeated.

183
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,400
And furthermore there are
times in this house...

184
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,400
...that I feel as if I'm living in
a never never land.

185
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,600
But don't hesitate to call on me
anytime you need help.

186
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,700
Hello.

187
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,900
You're awake?
- Sure, I'm awake.

188
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,500
What is all this?
- What?

189
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,400
Where am I?

190
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,900
Don't you remember? Father and I
drove you into town.

191
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,500
Is anything wrong?
- No.

192
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,600
The doctor says you will be alright
in a week or two.

193
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You were delirious you know?
Two days and two nights.

194
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,700
Oh maybe that's why
I'm so hungry.

195
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
I could eat a yearling steer...

196
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,400
...if I can catch one

197
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,600
We will get you something.

198
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,000
Mother!
You talked a lot in your deliria.

199
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,000
Mother, he's awake.
- How is he?

200
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,700
Hungry!

201
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,200
If he's hungry,
he's going to be alright.

202
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,600
Thanks a lot for housing.
- You're welcome.

203
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,800
Smoked sausages and eggs?

204
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,000
Sounds great.
- 2 eggs or would you like 3?

205
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,200
I would like 6.
- Ye shall have them.

206
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,200
Penny, get one of your father's
shirts here, and a razor.

207
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,500
I'll go get him some food...

208
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,800
So I talked a lot.
- Yes.

209
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,800
I listened only because
I thought that you might

210
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,800
say something that would
aide us in helping you.

211
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,200
...notifying your wife
for instance.

212
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,300
What did I say?
- If you had a wife.

213
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,300
What did I talk about?

214
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,000
You talked of Margaret,
she...

215
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,700
...fell out of a red dress...

216
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,700
What else?

217
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,900
Oh, you mentioned someone
named <i>"Lila".</i>

218
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,400
Is that all?

219
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,900
If you have a wife,
we could notify her.

220
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,600
No wife.

221
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,980
That's 12.

222
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,240
I haven't been so flattered
since my donuts...

223
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,340
won first prize at the fair
back in Pennsylvania.

224
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,090
They must be smart
in Pennsylvania.

225
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,830
Some of the members thought it's an
exhibition of pride to enter my donut.

226
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,320
But what harm can there be
in a little donut...

227
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,620
...unless, one eats so many
of them, they explode,

228
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,420
which is likely to happen
to you, young man.

229
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,950
...well there's worst ways
of checking out.

230
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:04,000
I'll help you with the dishes.
- No, you stay and watch Quirt Evans.

231
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,290
I'm curious to know
the effect of 6 eggs

232
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,290
a pound of sausage
and 12 donuts.

233
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,710
I'll call thee in
time for the milking.

234
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,820
Do all you people from Pennsylvania
talk like that?

235
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,370
Like what?

236
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,600
<i>"Thee."</i>

237
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,140
We're <i>"Friends".</i>

238
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,690
<i>"Friends"</i> of who?
- Of all.

239
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,400
The society of <i>"Friends".</i>
Many people call us <i>"Quakers".</i>

240
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,880
Oh! It's a religion.
- It's a belief.

241
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,500
That on the wall...

242
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,600
<i> "Each human being has an
integrity that can be hurt only...</i>

243
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,900
<i>..."by the act of that
same human being.</i>

244
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,300
<i>"...And not by the act of
another human being."</i>

245
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,200
Is that Quaker stuff?

246
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
You mean nobody can
hurt you but yourself?

247
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,400
That's what the <i>"Friends"</i> believe.

248
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,700
Well suppose somebody whacks you
over the head with a branding iron...

249
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,600
...won't that hurt?
- Physically, of course.

250
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,100
But in reality, it would injure only the
person doing the act of violence.

251
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,100
Only the doer can be hurt by
an evil or mean act.

252
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,200
Are there many of you Quakers?
- Very few.

253
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,600
Sort of figured that.

254
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,300
Good morning gentlemen.
- Good morning.

255
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,200
Carrot from our garden.

256
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
I found these out
at the road.

257
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,500
It belongs to a fella
named <i>"Quirt Evans".</i>

258
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,700
I understand you're
a friend of his,

259
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,200
maybe you can see to it
he gets them back...

260
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,000
Leave it here. I'll make sure
that he gets them.

261
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,800
That Quirt, he'd loose his shirt
if it wasn't buttoned on.

262
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,000
...careless about everything.

263
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,400
I keep telling him,
sooner or later.....

264
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,730
On second thoughts you can just
tell me where he's, and..

265
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:16,920
I can take it on back to him, myself.
Where is Quirt Evans?

266
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,850
You mean where is he?

267
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,470
Ever notice how fella keep
repeating the question,

268
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,270
when he's stalling
about answering.

269
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,960
Yeah! Maybe if I bend this gun over
his head, he'll quit stalling.

270
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,510
But gentlemen,
I hardly know Quirt Evans.

271
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,460
He lies too.

272
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,620
You've been bragging all over town
of what good friends you two are.

273
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,500
You know, this fella ain't got
many good qualities, has he?

274
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,070
Sit down, friend.

275
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:45,100
Maybe that will help your memory
I'm asking about Quirt Evans.

276
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,760
Well all I know is...

277
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,340
Thanks for sewing the shirt...

278
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,410
...but I can't find my pants.

279
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,600
Get back in bed.

280
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,280
Laziness is the only thing
that's kept me there this long.

281
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,520
The doctor said that you're to stay
in bed 4 more days.

282
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,410
Oye, you're up.

283
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,260
That's no way to speak
to an older person, John.

284
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,400
We're pals...

285
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,280
...you wouldn't expect a pal
to call me <i>"Mister",</i> would you?

286
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,390
See, doctor said to tell you that some
men in town are looking for you.

287
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,030
..Said one of them is
a Mister Laredo Stevens.

288
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,840
Get my pants.
- But you're leg.

289
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,640
Johnny, get me my pants.
- No, John.

290
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,110
Will thee get my pants?

291
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,730
Get the pants,
John.

292
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,470
But you said,

293
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:54,790
What are you looking at?
- Thee.

294
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,530
Oh boy, it's a good thing
I'm not a tattletale.

295
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,500
What set him off?

296
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,750
"Thee" is a familiar term.
- The what?

297
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:13,850
The familiar, the plain language.
<i>"Get thee my pants,"</i> ye said.

298
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:14,910
What about it?

299
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,700
Oh, among us, <i>"thee"</i> and <i>"thou"</i> are used
only among the loved ones.

300
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,570
...to all others, we use
<i>"You, he, and they"</i>

301
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,550
...mother to children, husband to wife
and children to...

302
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,590
Between lovers of course.

303
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,120
I'm sorry.
- I'm not.

304
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,360
What?

305
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,860
I'm not! I wished thee would
speak that way to me.

306
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,330
Well.

307
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,270
I knew right away.
That night.

308
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,450
It's supposed to be
a dull kind of life.

309
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,880
I could take you
a lot of places...

310
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,640
I'd go.
- What?

311
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,550
I would rather stay
here with thee

312
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,940
but if thee rather go someplace else,
then I would go someplace else.

313
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,260
I sound very bold?

314
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,140
Well, it's just that...

315
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:27,870
...I didn't think religious people
were quite so, sudden and direct...

316
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,400
Well that's the way I feel and it would
be dishonest to say anything else.

317
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,910
Yeah!

318
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,390
I used to wonder about it,
I suppose every girl does.

319
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,320
About what?

320
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,250
About love......

321
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:47,340
About whether or not you got to know
someone whom you know a little by little

322
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,150
...or it happened at once...

323
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,570
Thee are shocked....

324
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,990
Well, I wouldn't say shocked exactly....

325
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:02,610
...you sure get to the point.
- Should I be different?

326
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,720
No, Penny, I like you
just the way you are.

327
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,430
Who emptied this gun?
- Father

328
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:16,460
Quirt, a gun is a symbol of force, evil.
We never have one in our home.

329
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,520
It's a concession that father
allowed even an empty one.

330
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,840
It's only because you couldn't rest without...
- Where are the cartridges?

331
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:24,840
Outside.

332
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,590
Hey! Why don't we
just bust in?

333
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,550
Because busting through doors with
Quirt Evans on the other side,

334
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:48,060
...ain't my idea
of a healthy past time.

335
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,490
Tell them to <i>"come in".</i>

336
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,150
<i>"Come in."</i>

337
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,490
You can stand right there.

338
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,410
...against the light.

339
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,290
Howdy, Quirt.

340
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,060
You sure ran a ring
around me alright.

341
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,750
I don't think it was right
friendly of you to beat me

342
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,080
..to locating that tract
after my boys found it.

343
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,110
I'm willing to listen
to your side of it,

344
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,360
I'm a reasonable man.

345
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,440
Sure, Laredo is always reasonable

346
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,450
That's why he's the biggest man
in the territory.

347
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:35,370
You're the biggest man
in the territory, Laredo?

348
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,420
So a lot of people say.
- I hadn't heard.

349
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,220
You nervous?
- No, Evans.

350
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,980
I can't figure out, why you keep
stepping on my toes all the time...

351
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,940
But, that's your business.

352
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,040
I'm a good loser.

353
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,280
...I like a good loser.

354
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,290
Course I like any kind of loser
better than a winner.

355
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,800
...yeah!

356
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,090
You know I had a chance to
do a heap of thinking

357
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,090
while I was following your
trail across the territory.

358
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:04,680
I followed it by the string of
ran out horses you left behind....

359
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,980
Well, I figured it out this way.

360
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,340
Quirt, don't really
want that land.

361
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,680
Because working isn't
exactly in his line.

362
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,490
[Quirt]:
Is it in your line?

363
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:17,490
No, of course not. I was getting
it for another fella.

364
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,450
And well, I figured maybe you'll sell.

365
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,130
I don't hear anything jingle.

366
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,590
Is it alright to put my hand
inside my shirt?

367
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,860
Why not?

368
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,460
$5,000 in gold there.

369
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,700
I want 20.

370
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,930
Well okay, but I have to owe you 15,
that's all I got on me.

371
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:47,740
I have the deed in my pocket, here
- Get it out.

372
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,670
Now, if the young lady could find us
something to sign this with.

373
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,500
Still Laredo's hired boy,
eh, Hondo?

374
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:07,280
Picking up after him,
carrying matches for his cigars.

375
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,970
You mind yourself.
- He'll mind himself...

376
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,430
... Won't you Hondo?
- Miss...

377
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,460
..Would you mind taking this over
to Mister Evans please?

378
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,460
Thank you.

379
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,930
You know, I'm sure glad to see
you up and around, Quirt...

380
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,690
...we heard you were
flat on your back.

381
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,670
Sorry to disappoint you.

382
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:44,030
You come on over and get the
rest of that money anytime.

383
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,000
Anytime, that you feel
you're able.

384
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,810
I'll see you one
of these days.

385
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,640
Well... ah,
so long, Quirt.

386
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:20,820
Saddle up my horse, will you kid?
Throw on my war bags.

387
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,160
What would have happened if they
knew the gun was empty?

388
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,710
It would have been: <i>"Saturday
night in Sioux City."</i>

Tie on my slicker too.

390
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,170
Sorry.
- Oh, no, Quirt, no.

391
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,600
What kind of a boarder
do you think I'm?

392
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,740
You can't do that. We'd have tended
any wounded human, and not for pay.

393
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,650
You don't believe in force, so you
can't force me to take it back.

394
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,040
I'm afraid you're outwitted,
Thomas.

395
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,150
How long I have been here?
- Almost 3 weeks.

396
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,430
Kinda hate to get going.

397
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,970
But you can't. Your leg!
You are in no condition to travel.

398
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:03,400
Don't worry, your cooking has me
grained up and ready for market.

399
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,050
Adios, amigos.

400
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,140
Quirt.

401
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:17,740
Shall I pack my things?

402
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:22,280
Why?
- Thee leave without me?

403
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,910
I got places to go...

404
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,290
Quirt, I didn't care, it doesn't make
any difference to me how far...

405
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,170
I know so little...
I.....

406
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,210
...I didn't know that it could happen
to one and not the other.

407
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:46,700
..I thought it always
happen to both.

408

That isn't it.

409

It isn't?

Well...

411
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,620
Look, Penny...

412
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:08,230
...I'm not that kind of guy
that does things suddenly.

413
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,780
I gotta look before I leap.

414
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,210
You can ask anybody,
they'll tell you...

415
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:18,640
...Quirt Evans is a
mighty cautious citizen.

416

Oh then, it's just that thee
are not sure yet?

417
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:28,050
Yeah!
Sorry.

418
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,980
Please stay.

419
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,070
It's all saddled, Quirt.

420
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,280
Unsaddle it.

421
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,810
You gonna stay?

422
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,250
A double eagle!

423
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,290
Well there is something that I
rather have than this.

424
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,270
A favor. A big favor.
- Well, you got them both. What is it?

425
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,460
Will you ride past my
schoolhouse with me?

426
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,990
Because a lot of boys who don't
believe that I know Quirt Evans.

00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,390
Sure.

Well, see that thee do it...

443
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,130
Surely you could walk to
the barn without that.

444
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,850
What?
- The gun.

445
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,110
It balances me, one leg is longer
than the other.

There's the pitch fork.

hate those things.

Say, wasn't this place irrigated?

465
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,350
I see all these flumes
and ditches.

466
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,670
Frederick Carson
turned the water off.

467
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,840
Frederick Carson?

468
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,050
He's the man who bought
the ranch from friends

469
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,650
who couldn't make a go of it.

470
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:11,580
We had built a community dam,
but... It was on his property.

471
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:15,610
Whatcha you do about it?
Don't tell me. You prayed.

472
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:18,050
Of course.
- Getcha any water?

473
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:23,410
We didn't pray for water.
We prayed for Frederick Carson.

474
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,240
Carson turned off the water
and you prayed for him?

475
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,750
Of course.

476
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:34,780
Can't you see? By committing an evil act
the poor man injured his soul?

477
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,370
I'm glad there's a well.

478
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,800
Cause it sure gets thirsty
around here

479
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,300
...if we had to wait for Carson.
Gotta walk this pony.

480
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,090
Penny.

481
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,280
Nothing.

482
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,170
Be sure you don't leave any
slack on that cinch.

483
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,840
Boss will sure howl...

484
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,330
This ain't the first pony
I ever saddled.

485
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,630
...he'd squawk no matter
how I done it.

486
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,540
He's sure getting mean these days,
ain't he?

487
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,370
You can take it as his natural born.

488
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:29,570
That boil on his neck don't
help him none either.

489
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,780
Get out of my way.

490
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,530
You belong behind a plough.

491
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:02,910
Who's Carson?

492
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:06,660
Don't get down. We ain't taking
on no saddle tramps here.

493
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,060
Are you deaf?
I said get moving, tramp.

494
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,920
Nice dam.
- Yeah, what's that to you?

495
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,960
Take out the top two planks.

496
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,620
What did you say?

497
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:22,400
The top two. There are 16 inches
of water over there.

498
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,710
Who says so?
- I do.

499
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,150
And who might you be when
you're at home?

500
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,040
Quirt Evans.

501
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,290
Well anybody might ride up here
and say they're Quirt Evans.

502
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,820
He ain't known round
here by sight.

503
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,810
Anybody can say
they're him.

504
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:41,940
Sure could.

505
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,180
There's a <i>"Q. E."</i>
stamped on his saddle.

506
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,050
Well, take the top planks out of
the head gate you stupid idiot.

507
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,910
I don't need all that extra water.

508
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,490
Step up on that pony.

509
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,870
Now, look here Mr. Evans, I've done
what you've told me too.

510
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:15,500
You sure did.
Step up on that pony.

511
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,670
Well, I'm the kind of fella who tries to
get along with everybody.

512
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,500
Side me.
- Wait a minute.

513
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,120
Maybe we better take off a
couple more of them planks...

514
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,520
cause I have 10 times
the water I need.

515
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,730
That will do for now.

516
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:38,200
Well, if you ever need more, Mr. Evans,
all you got to do is say so...

517
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,650
I figured that...

518
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:52,850
Hey, Mom! Water!

519
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,980
Water, water!

520
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:01,760
Mother, look at the flow.
Mother all the ditches are full of water.

521
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:06,410
Water! Water!
- Wonderful!

522
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,610
Thomas!

523
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,910
Let's start off from the scratch...

524
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,020
...you got more water than you need.

525
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,340
Absolutely right, Quirt,
I mean Mr. Evans.

526
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:36,330
Do you mind if I call you <i>"Quirt"?</i>

527
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,840
Not a bit...

528
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,050
So it's no skin off your moccasins if
you let a little water over that ditch.

529
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:44,040
Absolutely no Mr. Evans...
I mean, <i>"Quirt".</i>

530
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:48,570
You're going to be neighborly or not?
- Well, I sure am, Quirt.

531
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,590
That's the way to talk.

532
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,780
Thomas!

533
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,840
Frederick Carson.
- Howdy, Mrs. Worth.

534
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:12,210
We always knew you would
change your mind.

535
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,530
Yes ma'am,
I did.

536
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:18,030
Thank you Frederick, all of us here
in the valley are grateful to you.

537
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,570
Well, it's like what
I was saying,

538
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:22,570
I ain't got any use
for all that extra water...

539
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,710
Why shouldn't let my
neighbors use it?

540
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,350
I believe that neighbors
should be friendly.

541
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:34,990
What have you got there on your neck?
A boil?

542
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:39,260
Mrs. Worth, I have wrestle with
that dang burnt boil...

543
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,360
Have you tried putting soap into it?

544
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,050
No, ma'am. I ain't.

545
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:46,020
You get down for a minute and into
the house and I'll fix it for you.

546
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,360
You are going to hurt me?
- No...That's a shame... it looks awful.

547
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:05,500
Well, looks like your prayers
straightened everything out.

548
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,080
So you think your gun changed
Frederick Carson?

549
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:10,060
Who says I pointed a gun?

550
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,990
I do.
- Well, I didn't.

551
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,380
He gave in more easily
than I expected.

552
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,300
Thee remember this Quirt:

553
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,000
<i>"The lord moves in
mysterious manner...</i>

554
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,210
<i>...at times using strange methods
and odd instruments."</i>

555
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,840
Me?
It would be odd.

556
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,900
I just get a gnawin' hankerin' after
good pies and truck like that...

557
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,630
Frederick Carson!
- Yes ma'am?

558
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:35,950
I want you to have these,

559
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,750
they're awfully good with
coffee in the morning.

560
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:40,580
Makes me to go home
and shoot my Chinese cook.

561
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:43,740
You just come back for more anytime
you like, there are always plenty.

562
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,420
Thanks.
- Goodbye.

563
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,970
Goodbye, Frederick.
- Goodbye.

564
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,430
A man outta see more
of his neighbors.

565
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:59,180
Wonderful woman that Mrs. Worth...
She fixed my boil.

566
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,560
[Mother]:
Penny!

567
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,900
Excuse me. But I think father
wants to give thanks...

568
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,630
You know, he already
thanked me.

569
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,360
I know, but now I think, he wants to
thank someone else.

570
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,320
Hold my pondering when I get aboard.
Will you?

571
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,540
Mrs. Worth is going to keep me
supplied with pies

572
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,910
... I ought to bring her a quarter of beef
now and then.

573
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,180
Finally, come to an understanding
with my neighbors.

574
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:34,760
You sure did.

575
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:40,410
Oh! You knew I was scare to death,
when I made that speech to them people.

576
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:44,730
...I'm glad you made me do it.
Makes me feel good.

577
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,440
Adios, amigo.

578
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,200
Dinner.

579
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,400
What's the dinner
going to be?

580
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,600
Roast venison, vegetables, and
of course a skimpy chicken.

581
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,800
With the pie and cake
I'll try to make out.

582
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:24,600
Chicken or venison?.
- Both. I feel real good.

583
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,300
Oh, thee do?

584
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,130
New dress.

585
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:45,140
Oh! It's first day.
You call it <i>"Sunday".</i>

586
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,500
Quirt, do me a favor,
hitch up the ponies for father.

587
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,950
Sure.

588
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:51,410
And will you do me
another favor?

589
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,660
Go for a ride with us.
- Where?

590
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:57,810
You're not to ask,
it's a surprise, a pleasant one.

591
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:07,180
Hey Quirt!
We gotta surprise for you.

592
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,640
He knows,
I told him.

593
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:12,920
Thought you weren't allowed
to work on Sundays.

594
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,060
Quirt, there is nothing we're
not allowed to do...

595
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,870
...it's just we don't believe
in doing what we know is wrong.

596
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,610
That makes it pretty much
<i>"Each fellas own guess".</i>

597
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:23,660
Each fell knows, inside.

598
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:26,830
There's a lot of gents I wouldn't
wanna give that much leeway too.

599
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,710
I didn't mean to
frighten you, miss.

600
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:59,060
Is a fella named Quirt Evans
around here?

601
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,860
Yes, I'll get him.

602
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,610
Never mind.
I can do my talking to you.

603
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:07,670
Has he been here long?

604
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,900
About 3 weeks I guess.

605
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:16,850
He didn't disappear for say
2 days, during that time, did he?

606
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:21,280
No.
- Hello, you weather beaten hang man...

607
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:24,260
Penny, this is Wistful McLintock...
the martial of the territory.

608
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,610
Hiya Miss!

609
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:28,410
Don't let that grey hair fool you.
He's a curly wolf.

610
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,390
Hello, Quirt. I thought I had
you about half hung.

611
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:36,670
Tall fella. Fast with a gun held up
the Bakers stage. Killed a couple.

612
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:42,000
Well, you're tall and some say
you're a fast man.

613
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:46,630
..but I guess, I'll have to take
the little lady's word for it.

614
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:51,510
When you and Laredo Stevens going to
get around to killing one another?

615
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,180
Laredo?

616
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,650
We water our horses out of the
same trough...

617
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:58,910
Well, I'm sure looking forward
to hanging the survivor.

618
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,990
You know, I'm a figuring man...

619
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,390
...sometimes I don't know
all the answers....

620
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,090
...like that fella
<i>"Quirt Evans"</i>

621
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:12,500
Handy man with a colt...

622
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:16,060
...while he was acting as Wyatt Earp's
deputy over in Tombstone

623
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,460
...one day turns in his badge,

624
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,260
and starts to build himself
a nice cattle spread.

625
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,810
Suddenly he sells out
and he goes on a pry.

626
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:34,880
Why? That's what I
ain't figured yet.

627
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:36,550
Sometimes things connect.

628
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:41,350
About that time a fella,
called <i>"Walt Emerson".</i>..

629
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,960
...went down in front of
Laredo Stevens...

630
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,770
...Walt was reaching for his gun,

631
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:50,270
some say a gambler standing there
grabbed his hand....

632
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:52,540
...maybe that's connected...

633
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,480
How did you stand
with Walt Emerson?

634
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:58,550
I knew him.

635
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:01,370
Two things connected?

636
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:03,870
I know a lot of people.

637
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,950
Well, I'll figure it out...

638
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:10,740
...I usually do.
I'm patient.

639
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,500
Little lady, don't be looking at him...

640
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:18,150
with your eyes all bugged out l
ike a cow would a bull.

641
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:22,640
...there ain't no future in it.
So long folks.

642
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,400
Quirt, please stay away
from Laredo Stevens.

643
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:32,000
He owes me money. And don't worry
I might come out on top.

644
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,040
That would be even worse.

645
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:37,530
Worse! Would it be worse if he
goes down than I go down?

646
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,160
Of course not,
don't you see?

647
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,300
Oh, I'll be a guy
with a marked soul.

648
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,740
Don't make it sound so crude, Quirt,
you see why- I couldn't love you.

649
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:51,430
Alright I won't
lookup Laredo.

650
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,650
It's better this way

651
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,070
...every time he opens his door,

652
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:58,370
every time he hears footsteps
coming round the corner...

653
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:01,270
...Laredo starts sweating,
thinking it's me.

654
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:03,650
...his food won't set well
for the rest of his life.

655
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:11,170
Well alright, if I'm going to be holy
I gotta get some fun out of it.

656
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:33,350
You know I feel like such a gadabout.

657
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:35,950
It seems hardly a whole week
since last First day.

658
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:55,910
Hey Quirt!

659
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,010
I thought it was you.

660
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,730
Well, well, well
- Hello.

661
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,490
Mister and Mrs. Worth,
Randy McCall.

662
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:11,020
How do you do
- How do you do?

663
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:12,580
Just fine, thank you.

664
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,520
Well, well, well...
- You said that before.

665
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:17,570
We don't want to keep you
if you're in a hurry.

666
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:20,050
I'm not in no hurry. I've got no place to go.
- Well, we have.

667
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,740
Would ye care to come along with us?
- Sure, where?

668
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,530
To a meeting.
Both men: To a meeting?

669
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:30,050
Yes, to meeting.
You don't wanna go do you?

670
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:33,630
It would be nice if he could.
- We'd be happy to have any friend of Quirt's.

671
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,120
You would?
Well that's fine.

672
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:38,740
You know ma'am...
I sure am an old friend of Quirt's.

673
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,650
I remember one time we were chasing
cattle down the Lawanda river...

674
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:46,590
...herd stampeded, Quirt pulled me out
from underneath it.

675
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,970
And there was another time remember?
In Opus Palace, down at San Antonio.

676
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,800
We're late.
- I know, but...

677
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:52,800
Good bye.

678
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,740
If you can join us it is in the grove,
just on the other side of the town.

679
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:57,370
Thank you ma'am.
- Good day.

680
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:59,250
Get along.
- Good day.

681
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:11,750

What comes out of this thing
that makes it worth all this work?

691
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,850
Frozen pudding.

692
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:51,480
Hello, Nelson.
- Hello, Penny.

693
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:53,560
Nelson, meet Quirt Evans.

694
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,780
- How do you do?
- Howdy.

695
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:00,590
Nelson's our horse shoer.

696
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:08,270
By the way I brought that
maple sugar you like so much.

697
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:11,440
Oh, excuse me, I'll put it here.
- Thank you.

698
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,980
Isn't this the Morgan baby?
- Yes, I'm minding her.

699
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,680
He sure is a cute little fella.

700
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:20,340
Looks just like his father.

701
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:27,540
I'm coming up next week
to shoe the horses.

702
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,690
Oh, Fine.

703
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:35,560
I'll get some water.
- Here, let me help you.

704
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,640
Here, twirl this thing.

705
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,250
Frozen pudding.

706
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,650
Hold him a minute, Quirt,
I want some of those flowers.

707
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:05,810
Sick or something?

708
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,420
I don't believe it.

709
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,250
It's a baby.
- Yeah, I know.

710
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:20,590
Is it old enough to talk?
- Of course not.

711
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:23,070
If it can't talk,
it can't snitch.

712
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:25,990
I've got something I think
you would like to hear.

713
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,720
Laredo Stevens
is making a big play.

714
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,650
...he's going to jump
up some guys

715
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:32,350
that are moving a trail herd
down from the north.

716
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:36,270
I figured, it maybe you, me and
couple of friends can play copycat.

717
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:39,550
You heard me,
didn't you?

718
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:41,850
You can have
my part of it.

719
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:43,650
What am I listening to?

720
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:46,550
You passing up a chance
to blister Laredo?

721
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:47,450
That's right.

722
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:49,150
What's the matter with you Quirt?
Is farm life...

723
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,650
Oh, the Jane....

724
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:55,130
Sticking in your head into this bucket
will shut you up.

725
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,610
You are awful touchy lately... you never
used to mind what I said.

726
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,700
Hello.
- Hi.

727
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:02,260
Come along with the water, Quirt.

728
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,760
Shut up.

729
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:26,610
Quirt, would you
come over here?

730
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,390
Sit down.

731
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:44,400
May I have your attention?

732
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:49,240
Friends, we all know the purpose
of this meeting is three fold.

733
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:52,990
As always to give thanks to the
goodness bestowed upon us.

734
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:58,480
...but also to give thanks for particular
that the fields are getting water.

735
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:00,950
... and the crops and
the livestock's thrive.

736
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:03,930
There are two marsh's
right at the top of the valley.

737
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:08,020
...if you take a look from out there, you
can see a herd coming from 10 miles.

738
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,310
[Mr. Worth]:
...Quirt Evans.

739
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:18,140
Friends...

740
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:28,540
We are happy to present you with this
token of our friendship for you.

741
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,490
This is <i>"Quirt Evans".</i>

742
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:40,760
We are happy to have him here with us,
because he provided another incident

743
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,880
...which reaffirms our belief...

744
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:45,650
...that all men are good
if they're shown the light.

745
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,820
He persuaded <i>"Frederick Carson"</i>
to let down the water...

746
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:53,090
...by showing him, that a man who
is a friend to other men...

747
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,710
is a happy man himself.

748
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:03,140
May I shake your hand,
Quirt Evans?

749
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:24,550
I want to talk to you.

750
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:34,650
This will sound like I'm butting
into your business and I'm.

751
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:37,550
And you outta give me a watch
with a gold case for doing it.

752
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:40,150
You dim witted nail bender!
Marry that girl.

753
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:43,150
Marry her? Why sure, you know...,
she knows how I feel.

754
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:44,850
How would she know?

755
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:48,250
Stop yamering about shoeing horses
that's no way to talk to a girl.

756
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:52,650
Talk to her about her.
And marry her. And do it quick.

757
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:56,150
Hey!
- Come on!

758
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:07,350
Listen to this.....

759
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:10,350
<i>"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,</i>

760

761
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:14,350
<i>"who had done many acts of valor,</i>

762
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:15,500

midst of a pit in time of snow"</i>

764
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:20,650
Whoo! Three lions!

765
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:24,650
<i>"And Benaiah slew an Egyptian

slew him with a staff."</i>

767
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:29,350
I guess that must mean
a club

768
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:32,750
Oh, brother this is good writing.
- Let's go.

769
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:34,650
What about the Bible?

770
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,750
You can't throw it away,
That would be bad luck.

771
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:37,950
Then keep it.

772
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:42,050
Alright. This is one book,
I'm sure going to read.

773
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:57,250
I would better take you back
to the Morgan's.

774
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:03,950
Why did Quirt leave
so abruptly?

775
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:07,350
I don't know...

776
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:27,950
Hey Bob!
- Yeah?

777
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:31,050
Right on time.
Look behind you.

778
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:42,250
Let's saddle up men.

779
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,450
Let's get out of here.

780
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:27,350
Look! Coming down
off the hill!

781
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:30,850
Come on...

782
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:09,450
Hey Quirt,
what does <i>"beget"</i> mean?

783
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:15,150
I think I hear them.

784
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:19,350
Yeah!
- Let's get hitched up.

785
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:22,750
I don't know how I
missed this book.

786
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:28,000
You know you're very strange.
But I like you just the same.

787
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:29,950
On account your head works.

788
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:34,450
Much nicer this way....

789
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:36,950
You know anybody can
just shoot these guys.

790
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:39,350
...you think of an interesting
way of doing it.

791
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:42,750
...and you know Quirt!
I hate to shoot people.

792
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:45,850
Remember I shot a waddie
once in Montana?

793
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:48,350
I dreamed about it,
all the next night.

794
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:51,400
Then of course, there's always witnesses,
than you gotta shoot the witnesses.

795
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:55,050
Stop jabbering and let's go.
- Okay, take it easy pal.

796
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:57,050
Settle down,
don't wanna lose my war bags.

797
00:59:57,950 --> 01:00:00,350
Then again, I figured you may
have changed your mind

798
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:02,850
about shooting it out with Laredo
along with these guys.

799
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:06,050
Step up on that horse.
- Okay, you got it.

800
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:10,650
Maybe you're just crowding Laredo
into drawing in front of a lot of people.

801
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:13,250
Gonna saving him for the big night
In town, eh!

802
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:18,550
Hey... look!

803
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:24,550
Let's go.

804
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:03,250
Take the outsider, Dennis.

805
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:51,550
Start turning them, Hondo.

806
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,250
I ain't, Hondo.

807
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,750
That's a horse like Quirt has...

808
01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:33,750
Yeah! That's just who it is.

809
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:37,850
Next time we face...
- Yeah! I know...

810
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:41,850
Wipe those new boots off
and see if you can run him down.

811
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,850
You know that champagne maybe
a lot fancier than whiskey.

812
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:12,250
..But sure it don't give
you quick action.

813
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:15,550
To tell you the truth. I don't really like it.
- It's very fashionable.

814
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:17,050
How do you like it?

815
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:20,650
Tickles going down and it's expensive.
So I like it.

816
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:24,450
You sleepy Tommy?
- Nope.

817
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,250
Tired?
- No.

818
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:29,550
Worried or maybe
just plain bored?

819
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:32,650
Not a chance baby.
You never bored me.

820
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:34,650
I wish I had that in writing.

821
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:37,350
You know it's a long time
since you told me that...

822
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:39,750
...my hair reminded you of corn silk.

823
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:45,150
Alright! Your hair reminds
me of corn silk.

824
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:49,550
All golden, darling?
- That's right...

825
01:03:50,350 --> 01:03:51,930
All golden.

826
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:59,850
You have changed...
You're less romantic.

827
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:03,350
...a lot more absentminded.

828
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:08,550
Take a turn at the wheel.
Win yourself a farm in Kansas.

829
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:11,150
I don't want a farm in Kansas.

830
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:14,550
Well alright! I'll win you
a trip around the world.

831
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:21,550
Miss Lila, the customers are waiting,
and that's no way to treat customers.

832
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:58,550
25 hot one on the red.

833
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:01,750
Give me a stack of blues.

834
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:14,250
<i>"There's something in your eyes...</i>

835
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:17,050
<i>"...a little bit different.</i>

836
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:21,550
<i>"Something that appeals to me.</i>

837
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:27,850
<i>"I love the way they change
from angels to devils...</i>

838
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:32,150
<i>"always full of mystery.</i>

839
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:38,650
<i>"There is something in your smile
a little bit different...</i>

840
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:42,550
<i>"Something I've been looking for.</i>

841
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:48,950
<i>"If I can just be sure

842
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:53,050
<i>"...I would never ask for more.</i>

843
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:58,350
<i>"I've had a funny little feeling...</i>

844
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:03,050
<i>"...the first time we met.."</i>

845
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:04,650
17 odd on black.

846
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:07,850
17, there goes the last button
on my shirt.

847
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:13,550
Alright buddy, you gonna let it ride?
Going to ride on 17?

848
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:15,950
Cash me in.

849
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:19,950
Place your bets.

850
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:25,550
<i>â€œSomething that I never knew...â€</i>

851
01:06:25,650 --> 01:06:28,250

852
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:32,750

853
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:40,950
<i>"That's why I - love - youuuu!!!"</i>

854
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:43,950
Thanks for the money, daddy.

855
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:46,650
I hope you didn't think
I was hinting.

856
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:52,050
Bourbon,
large glass.

857
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:53,550
There's plenty of rooms on either side,

858
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:56,050
you have to come bullying
in between us?

859
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:57,350
I didn't see you...

860
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,500
You interrupted a very
important discussion

861
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,740
on serious matters
regarding big things.

862
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:03,600
Me and my brothers,
don't like it.

863
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:05,710
Gentlemen, gentlemen...
no trouble please.

864
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:09,070
We just put the place back together
after the last difference of opinion..

865
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:12,260
...gentlemen, more over the breakage
and the overhead. Mainly the breakage.

866
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,710
I had a dreadful time
keeping body and soul together

867
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:18,810
What I think is going to happen,
happens...

868
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:20,810
...it will round off a full day.

869
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:24,980
There's your trip.

870
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:27,330
What's eating you Tall man?

871
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:29,660
You had words with
those Baker brothers?

872
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:31,930
Who?
- Those 4 rhinos.

873
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:36,690
No.

874
01:07:36,790 --> 01:07:38,770
Told around they're some
quarrelsome citizens.

875
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:43,740
Gentlemen, lets consider the incident
closed. Watch our tempers.

876
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:47,370
Maybe I would go
and apologize.

877
01:07:58,570 --> 01:08:00,800
More whiskey.
-That did it!

878
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:06,170
I'll be right back.
I hope.

879
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:19,290
Where have you been?
- Oh, Randy always on tap.

880
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,380
You don't know what you
are doing to me...

881
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,220
Please...
I've got a large family.

882
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:41,750
Hey, wait a minute,
it's me.

883
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:47,550
Billy, get him.

884
01:08:47,650 --> 01:08:49,350
That's my old friend, Billy.

885
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:58,550
Come on get him... come on
get hold of him.

886
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:05,350
Go on, you got him.
You've got him!

887
01:09:07,650 --> 01:09:09,150
Thanks.

888
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:13,850
I must have hit the wrong man.
- I'll say you did, you...

889
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:26,250
Hey, for...!
- Sorry, Quirt. How you doing?

890
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:40,650
Don't worry about me.
Come on.

891
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:44,250
You wait outside. Check them
and count them as we throw them out.

892
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:52,250
One!
- Don't count!

893
01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:05,850
It's gettin' late.

894
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:11,650
Oh honey, I was so afraid
you'd get hurt.

895
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:20,650
All singing:<i>"And I'll never see my
darling any more </i>

896
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:26,650
<i>"I'm sitting by the river
and I'm weeping all the day!!! </i>

897
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:30,650
<i>"For you've gone from the
old Kentucky shore!!!"</i>

898
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:34,950
It's wonderful. We have money,
whiskey and lovely ladies.

899
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:36,350
and just had a beautiful fight.

900
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:38,650
...I tell you, we would really ought a
be thankful for our blessings.

901
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:41,250
Ah, you have been reading
that bible again.

902
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:43,050
That's something I never
thought I would see.

903
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:44,150
What?

904
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:45,850
A Bible with your name on it.

905
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:49,050
Now where would you
get a Bible?

906
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:56,450
Quirt!

907
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:03,150
Oh Randy,
stop him.

908
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:04,750
With what?

909
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:07,350
Where is he going?
Has he forgotten something?

910
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:09,150
No.

911
01:11:17,450 --> 01:11:21,150
Penny, what is wrong with thee?

912
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:23,750
Table cloths don't belong in there.

913
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:26,550
Oh, I'm sorry.

914
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:06,950
Quirt!

915
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:09,450
Unsaddle my horse,
will you kid ?

916
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:10,850
Sure!

917
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:12,950
Wanna a boarder for a while?

918
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:15,750
Of course. You're always welcome
- Quirt!

919
01:12:15,850 --> 01:12:17,250
Hello!

920
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:20,550
I haven't had a decent meal
since I left here. Chocolate?

921
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:23,350
Not very good, the flour you know.

922
01:12:23,450 --> 01:12:25,650
I'll just stick around
till you get one right.

923
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:28,550
I'll feed the chickens.
- So early, Penny?

924
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:31,050
Yes. Can you help me Quirt?

925
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:41,150
Does it take two to feed
a few chickens, mother?

926
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:45,850
At times, Thomas, at times.
Remember?

927
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:55,950
You came back?

928
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:58,150
Yes.

929
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:01,650
Why?

930
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:04,950
I don't know exactly.

931
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:07,350
Why did you go away
without saying anything?

932
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:09,450
I don't know that exactly, either.

933
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:12,250
I think it's because
I frightened you.

934
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:15,450
I know that sounds strange
that I should frighten you, but .....

935
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:16,950
...but I mean it

936
01:13:17,050 --> 01:13:20,250
You were frightened
because I was stupid.

937
01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:22,350
You thought that living with me
will be tiresome ...

938
01:13:22,450 --> 01:13:24,850
..and dull after a while.

939
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:27,050
Tiresome and dull because....

940
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:31,250
...all I knew, raised since a baby,
here among the farmers was our belief...

941
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:36,250
...that people love, marry, and
stay together forever after that.

942
01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:40,950
I'm not such a fool not to know that
outside worldly places that people love...

943
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:45,350
...it doesn't have to follow that they
marry and stay together forever.

944
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:47,450
I know that sometimes
they separate.

945
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:49,250
Are you ever going to run down
and let me talk ?

946
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:52,650
No, Quirt, that's what you were afraid of,
that I tie myself around your neck ..

947
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:55,650
...and when you get tired you
couldn't be rid of me...

948
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:59,150
and I made up my mind that if you
come back I'd tell you this.

949
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:01,650
...but whatever you want,
Quirt, you can leave...

950
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:04,050
If I go away
ye go with me.

951
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,010
If I go away,
thee go away.

952
01:14:21,150 --> 01:14:23,250
I used to be an Injun fighter.

953
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:27,850
Just can't help walking up
soft on people..

954
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:30,550
Morning missy...

955
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:34,250
This young man here been doing
any traveling since I was here last?

956
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:38,050
A fellow over Castle Verde Way lost
a big herd a few days ago.

957
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:42,250
Well, missy...
Cat got your tongue?

958
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:44,950
Why ask her?
You know I have been traveling.

959
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:47,350
You look at my coral
to see how my horse shaped up ..

960
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:50,850
I did just that...
You sure covered a lot of country.

961
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:53,750
It's a right weary animal..

962
01:14:54,350 --> 01:14:57,950
I just want to see if the young lady
would lie for you.

963
01:15:01,650 --> 01:15:04,050
I was going to...

964
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:05,750
You have been over to Castle Verde Way?

965
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:09,050
I've been to Rimrock
and I got witnesses to prove it.

966
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:11,950
Witnesses!
For instance?

967
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:15,650
Randy McCall, Christine Taylor.

968
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:20,450
That's what I call witnesses.
Who else?

969
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:23,250
Lila Neal, I suppose.

970
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:26,050
She'd make a good
alibi witness for you.

971
01:15:26,450 --> 01:15:29,650
Randy, Christine and Lila...

972
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:32,150
...there's three to draw to.

973
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:35,750
So Lila saw you there too, huh?

974
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:37,550
Yes.

975
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:47,350
Come here, jug head...
You dollar and a half bush jumper...

976
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:56,000
Well, guess I missed you again, Quirt.

977
01:15:57,450 --> 01:15:59,350
...but I'm patient..

978
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:02,550
...that's what hangs all you fellows
in the end.

979
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:04,850
...I'm patient.

980
01:16:13,950 --> 01:16:15,550
Lila?

981
01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:20,550
You talked about her
when you were delirious.

982
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:57,160
Quirt, I...

983
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,660
...I wish my hair was...

984
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:04,660
...golden like corn silk, like you said.

985
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:32,160
There is a sight
I never thought I'd see.

986
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,610
Quirt Evans behind a plough.

987
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:38,040
The pony walks as soft as you do.

988
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:42,390
I taught him
Oh, I figured you'd have heard him.

989
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:45,310
...except you were thinking too hard.

990
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:50,950
Haven't you got some real important
business to attend to?

991
01:18:50,950 --> 01:18:53,450
Some place else.
- Sure.

992
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:56,650
But I always liked to keep track
of your whereabouts.

993
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:07,050
You know, Quirt...

994
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:11,150
...I always figured on using a
new rope in hanging you...

995
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:15,050
Kind of respected you.

996
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:17,850
You never took the best of things....

997
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:20,850
...and all your men went down
looking at you.

998
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:23,450
Go and mind your own business.

999
01:19:23,650 --> 01:19:25,250
I usually do.

1000
01:19:25,850 --> 01:19:30,550
It's a shame things don't always
turn out the way they should.

1001
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:36,450
Now that little gal... she might marry
some young fella ..

1002
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:39,750
...who would know what to
do with that plough...

1003
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:43,450
Why don't you kick up that horse
and move on?

1004
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:46,550
Some young fella that would
raise up a lot of grain.

1005
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:51,850
...cows, sheep, kids..

1006
01:19:53,050 --> 01:19:57,950
..kind of a fella that she'd
always know where he was..

1007
01:19:58,350 --> 01:20:00,550
Do I have to run you off?

1008
01:20:00,650 --> 01:20:05,650
Well now I tell you. I never have
been run off no place yet.

1009
01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:08,050
...where I aim to stay.

1010
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:11,350
But it just so happens
that I gotta be gone.

1011
01:20:17,050 --> 01:20:18,850
No, Quirt...

1012
01:20:19,650 --> 01:20:22,050
...you don't rate a
new rope with me.

1013
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:45,150
Look, ah...

1014
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:51,450
...does a lot of potpourri and
non sense have to go with it?

1015
01:20:51,550 --> 01:20:53,050
..I'm not going to stand
for a lot of...

1016
01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:55,150
dressing up and a batch
of jabbering people...

1017
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:57,550
...looking at me,
just because I'm getting married.

1018
01:20:59,350 --> 01:21:02,850
Oh Quirt,
come along with me.

1019
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:06,550
Well, yes or no?
- Come on.

1020
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:10,550
Picking black berries?

1021
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:13,650
Alright

1022
01:21:18,050 --> 01:21:19,850
Alright.

1023
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:43,450
I think we have enough, Quirt.

1024
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:51,650
Never did like black berries...
Now I know I was right.

1025
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:56,650
It's too much work connected with it.
- I'll get some more ferns.

1026
01:22:16,690 --> 01:22:19,710
Look out there's a wasp on the petunia!
- Don't kill it.

1027
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:23,730
Well it's alright to for you to trust
wasps and people but...

1028
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:27,250
...he might have known that I don't trust
him and decide to take first bite.

1029
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:30,940
And incidentally that's not petunia,
that's a daisy.

1030
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,560
That's a petunia.

1031
01:22:33,210 --> 01:22:35,170
Petunias, daisies,
daisies, petunias.

1032
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:38,050
Quirt Evans.

1033
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:42,050
Oh nothing.
I just like the sound of it.

1034
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:45,550
Quirt. Where did thee ever get
such an odd name?

1035
01:22:45,950 --> 01:22:48,850
Fellow who half raised me,
gave it to me.

1036
01:22:49,150 --> 01:22:52,350
He found me somewhere along
a big cattle trail.

1037
01:22:52,450 --> 01:22:56,150
Folks had been bushwhacked
by the Indians, I guess..

1038
01:22:56,650 --> 01:22:59,450
He was a big fella.
Cattleman.

1039
01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:02,150
Swung a wide loop in his younger days,
I think.

1040
01:23:02,450 --> 01:23:03,650
Wide loop?

1041
01:23:03,850 --> 01:23:06,950
He wasn't too careful
whose calf he threw his rope at..

1042
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:10,950
Most of the old cattlemen
were like that.

1043
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:16,250
He raised me. Quite a guy.
His name was Walt Emerson.

1044
01:23:17,550 --> 01:23:21,050
He was down in a gambling place...

1045
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:26,230
...a fellow grabbed his gun-arm just
as he drew. He was murdered.

1046
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:29,310
Stop it.

1047
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:31,880
Then what?

1048
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:34,950
Well I just bounced around
from place to place.

1049
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:37,280
Quirt Evans.

1050
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:11,180
I don't see any gun.
- I know him, he's got a gun alright..

1051
01:24:11,870 --> 01:24:13,080
...I know him.

1052
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,080
Hyah!

1053
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:02,080
Hyah! Hyah!

1054
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:22,500
Hyah!

1055
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:07,500
Hyah! Hyah!

1056
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,500
Hyah!

1057
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
[Oh shit!]

1058
01:27:07,450 --> 01:27:09,400
Well, what are we waiting for?

1059
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:13,690
Nothing I guess.
Let's find a saloon.

1060
01:27:19,530 --> 01:27:21,860
You don't have to be worry
about Penny, mother.

1061
01:27:22,290 --> 01:27:25,250
Oh, I cant help worrying about it,
Johnny.

1062
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:29,420
Get that doctor,
Burn up the roads both ways.

1063
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:18,340
A drink?

1064
01:28:21,610 --> 01:28:22,750
It's amazing...

1065
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:26,580
...the various uses to which
men put alcohol.

1066
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:29,470
To each different individual

1067
01:28:29,790 --> 01:28:33,230
It's either a stimulant, depressant
or anodyne

1068
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:36,080
Just now I'm using it
as an anodyne.

1069
01:28:37,670 --> 01:28:38,920
Get to the point.

1070
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:42,480
Practice of medicine...

1071
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:46,010
...is one of the most infuriating
professions known to man.

1072
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:50,720
It takes 30 years of experience
to teach you...

1073
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:55,230
...that in the final analysis there's
nothing to do but stand and watch.

1074
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:02,820
If she has an elusive moment...

1075
01:29:03,970 --> 01:29:05,650
...you better speak to her

1076
01:29:18,690 --> 01:29:21,110
...I'm not trying to argue you out
of anything.

1077
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:23,720
Maybe you ought to
stop and think.

1078
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,410
She wouldn't like this,
Quirt!

1079
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:34,810
...I'm not arguing for or against
her point of view.

1080
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:37,920
...I know to her, the worlds worst
tragedy would be

1081
01:29:38,020 --> 01:29:39,940
if you should kill a man.

1082
01:29:40,470 --> 01:29:42,680
Of course you could
argue logically...

1083
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,830
that she wouldn't know whether
you killed him or not.

1084
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:47,460
I think she'd know.

1085
01:29:48,130 --> 01:29:51,050
Any discussion has to have
at least two participants.

1086
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,300
Of course if you refuse
to answer me.

1087
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:56,800
Quirt!

1088
01:30:01,150 --> 01:30:03,250
If I felt cynical....

1089
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:06,750
...this would be a good opportunity to
observe what we are about to see,

1090
01:30:06,850 --> 01:30:10,650
...a perfect example of
<i>"An eye for an eye"</i> etc.

1091
01:30:11,450 --> 01:30:14,850
Unfortunately I can't quote
chapter and verse.

1092
01:30:15,450 --> 01:30:18,250
...I'm too tired
to be cynical.

1093
01:30:25,950 --> 01:30:29,150
Father, father,
come upstairs!

1094
01:30:30,850 --> 01:30:33,650
But thee are very ill,
thee must not be moving about.

1095
01:30:34,150 --> 01:30:35,250
Mother, I've got to go ...

1096
01:30:35,350 --> 01:30:37,750
Thee must get back into bed.
- But he needs me.

1097
01:30:37,850 --> 01:30:40,350
This is insanity. I told you
to keep her in bed

1098
01:30:40,450 --> 01:30:42,150
Do you want to commit suicide?

1099
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:44,150
If you don't stay under
those covers young lady...

1100
01:30:48,950 --> 01:30:50,650
There's no fever.

1101
01:30:50,650 --> 01:30:53,550
Thee must do what the doctor says.
- Mother, please.

1102
01:30:54,050 --> 01:30:55,950
I can't understand it.

1103
01:30:56,850 --> 01:30:59,150
I can't understand it at all.

1104
01:30:59,350 --> 01:31:02,150
There must be some logical
scientific explanation.

1105
01:31:02,350 --> 01:31:04,950
I'm too old to start
believing in miracles.

1106
01:31:05,450 --> 01:31:07,450
Wrap her in blankets.

1107
01:31:29,450 --> 01:31:31,650
You know if the two hadn't
had me covered...

1108
01:31:32,350 --> 01:31:36,050
I would never let that Hondo Jeffries
pistol whip me...

1109
01:31:36,250 --> 01:31:39,050
Wait till Quirt Evans hear about this...

1110
01:31:40,050 --> 01:31:43,050
Quirt will take the starch out of
the whole caboodle of them.

1111
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:45,050
Why, Quirt and me once...

1112
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:48,550
...well, it was Dodge City
several years back.

1113
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:52,650
...when the Earps and Clantons were gunning.
Well me and Quirt...

1114
01:31:57,050 --> 01:32:00,250
Come here.
- Yes, Mr. Evans.

1115
01:32:10,750 --> 01:32:12,450
Know Laredo Stevens?

1116
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:14,050
He's in the Eagle,

1117
01:32:14,150 --> 01:32:16,550
and that pistol whipping Hondo
is with him.

1118
01:32:19,550 --> 01:32:21,550
Take him a message.

1119
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:30,050
Hey, buy the boys a drink.
- Celebrating?

1120
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:32,850
Sure,
why not?

1121
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:35,350
Don't you get excited when you
make a big win like this?

1122
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:39,150
Why get excited... sometimes you win
and sometimes you loose.

1123
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:42,550
Don't get excited,
gentlemen.

1124
01:32:52,050 --> 01:32:54,350
I ain't looking for trouble...

1125
01:32:54,650 --> 01:32:58,550
I'm just a carrier of a message.
- Yeah? What is it?

1126
01:32:58,650 --> 01:33:00,650
He said to <i>"Come out in the street...</i>

1127
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:03,950
<i>...he's waiting for you."</i>
- Who says?

1128
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:05,550
Quirt Evans.

1129
01:33:06,050 --> 01:33:09,550
[Hits sour note on piano]

1130
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:15,950
What is this, a joke?
Quirt Evans is...

1131
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:19,050
Take a look out at the streets.
See, if it really is.

1132
01:33:23,650 --> 01:33:25,750
Jack, take a look at the street.

1133
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:45,050
There's a tall hombre in
a black hat standing...

1134
01:33:45,250 --> 01:33:47,550
...at the blacksmith's shop

1135
01:33:52,650 --> 01:33:55,950
Mind if I use the back door, Pete?
- So long, Pete.

1136
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:17,050
Well, they say <i>"a cat got nine lives."</i>

1137
01:34:19,250 --> 01:34:21,050
Maybe ole Quirt's part cat.

1138
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:24,450
He also said <i>"He was curious to know
how much whiskey it would take...</i>

1139
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:27,650
<i>"...to build up your nerve
to come out."</i>

1140
01:34:27,850 --> 01:34:29,050
You're fixing to get
your ears pin back?

1141
01:34:29,550 --> 01:34:30,650
There's a better pair of ears
out in the street...

1142
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:32,750
if you wanna pin
somebody's ears back.

1143
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:34,950
Hey, you drink this.

1144
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:39,450
Sure, if I don't have to
stand near you.

1145
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:40,950
Come on.

1146
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:43,450
I wonder whether if that sharp
shooting Marshal is around town?

1147
01:34:43,550 --> 01:34:45,950
Oh, I saw him ride out of town
an hour ago.

1148
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:51,350
That's good, we don't want him
around here to spoil our play.

1149
01:34:51,550 --> 01:34:54,850
Yeah, I bet that's just exactly
how you meant it.

1150
01:35:28,650 --> 01:35:31,450
Look out, there's going
to be a shooting!

1151
01:35:31,650 --> 01:35:35,450
Hyah, hyah!

1152
01:36:25,750 --> 01:36:27,250
Quirt!

1153
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:23,950
Quirt...

1154
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:26,950
...step away from those women.

1155
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:35,550
Why don't you
turn around, Quirt?

1156
01:37:38,550 --> 01:37:40,550
[Gun shots ring out!]

1157
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:03,550
Nothing ever works out right.

1158
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:15,250
Had them dead to rights.
They got the Baker stage

1159
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:18,550
...so I figured out what's the rukkas.

1160
01:38:18,550 --> 01:38:22,250
You down them
and I'd hang you....

1161
01:38:22,550 --> 01:38:24,150
...sort of...

1162
01:38:24,550 --> 01:38:27,450
..Sort of killing three hawks
with one stone.

1163
01:38:27,950 --> 01:38:29,150
...so to speak.

1164
01:38:30,650 --> 01:38:33,950
Nothing, nothing ever works out right.

1165
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:39,750
I may have missed you again, Quirt,
but I'm patient.

1166
01:38:40,550 --> 01:38:43,050
It's only a matter of time,
and I hang you.

1167
01:38:43,850 --> 01:38:45,950
Not me,
mister.

1168
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:48,850
From now on
I'm a farmer.

1169
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:05,850
That Quirt!

1170
01:39:11,650 --> 01:39:13,150
Hey Quirt might need that.

1171
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:17,650
No, only a man that carries a gun
ever needs one.

1172
01:39:17,950 --> 01:39:20,150
What are you going
to do with it?

1173
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:24,350
Hang it on the wall in my office,
with a new rope!
