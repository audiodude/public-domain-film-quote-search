1
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,600
No bad writer. Good style,
rich imagination. Very talented.

2
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,120
-Thank you.
-No problems.

3
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,760
-Room B, room A, wonders where room E is.
-I do not know.

4
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,760
-Are you going to the lecture?
-No.

5
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,640
We're looking for where she's going.

6
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,560
-Oh! Sorry.
-Excuse.

7
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,800
-Where is the Waterbury lecture?
- Are not you Owen Waterbury?

8
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,520
-Follow me.
-Where are you taking us?

9
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,640
-To room E.
-Are you a student or teacher?

10
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,320
Student.

11
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,880
-Advanced or beginner?
-What do you think?

12
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,280
I think you seem advanced.

13
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,760
-Mr Waterbury. You arrive on time.
-Mr Kilbride.

14
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,040
We have to wait for the laundry.
The underpants are not dry yet.

15
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,640
-My friend, Mr Ronnie Hastings.
-Good day, Mr Hastings.

16
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,640
-I'm going to get a chair.
-No, I'm sitting in the audience.

17
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,040
-Good day.
-Good day.

18
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,160
-Are you also going to become a writer?
-I hope so.

19
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:46,000
-The lecture will be very helpful.
-A great writer.

20
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,080
Most of his spreads
come from me, of course.

21
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,400
- You're in my seat.
-Sorry.

22
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,560
-Godafton, miss Gaylord.
-Mr Scott.

23
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,880
-Is this busy?
- Clarence Henderson is not coming.

24
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,440
-Why do I have to move?
-We do not talk to each other.

25
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:17,720
May I ask for your attention?
Tonight's guest lecturer

26
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:25,240
-is Owen Waterbury, author of the
bestseller "Last Year's Love".

27
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,120
Higher!

28
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,920
It is enough.

29
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,320
Most of you have
a job to do during the day.

30
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,520
Still, you have studied
writing technique in the evenings.

31
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,360
Now you are ready to take the pen
and go out and conquer the world.

32
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,800
I'm not the right person to
teach you because I do not follow any rules.

33
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:03,160
Today, a writer must think about both
the bestseller list and his art.

34
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:09,240
A conflict of loyalty
that breeds dishonesty.

35
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,720
WHAT DO YOU WORK WITH?

36
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:19,160
Now I have got in the middle of the dry
and intend to write a really good book.

37
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,960
I AM SECRETARY

38
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,160
The beautiful writing art
is here and here.

39
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:37,160
If the mind and the heart do not find
the right words, do not write.

40
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,360
Is he not brilliant?

41
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,960
A writer must believe in
himself. Then half the battle is won.

42
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,880
I interrupt the lecture for
a moment to say that ...

43
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,480
... I'll be able to help
someone in the room now.

44
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,160
From tomorrow
I will need a secretary.

45
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:13,040
The school's agency is informed
and the right man or woman gets the job.

46
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,000
DO YOU WANT THE JOB?

47
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,240
It's not a great job,
but the work environment is nice.

48
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,720
HOW DO I GET IT?

49
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,280
SEARCH IT, STUMP!

50
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,240
- Are you going to work for Owen Waterbury?
- Got the job from his staff man.

51
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,920
-Have heard strange things about him.
-You do it about everyone.

52
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,240
-The lecture was so inspiring.
-You have worked here for five years.

53
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,160
A little too long for someone
with my ambitions.

54
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,640
-Where does Mr Waterbury usually work?
-In his apartment.

55
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,920
An author does not work in an office.
He can teach me to be a writer.

56
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,240
In a year, I might sign
my own books at your bookstore.

57
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,840
-After a course by Owen Waterbury.
-And get paid at the same time.

58
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,880
-I'll miss you, Steve.
-No, in a week you've forgotten me.

59
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,880
No, but good luck anyway.

60
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:47,400
You probably understand how I feel.
You've been amazing to me.

61
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,280
I understand.

62
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:58,200
Steve! Call sometime
and tell me how it goes.

63
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,480
I'll call tonight,
when I've got the job.

64
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,880
-See you for how to park!
-You can back out!

65
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,600
Save your energy until we get up.
Give me the bags.

66
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,280
I can carry them.
Taxi drivers are not wise.

67
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,600
Floor 3 E.

68
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,680
A single nasty word from him
and you cut.

69
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,840
- They can take my license.
-You're defending a lady.

70
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,840
-You know I have hard fists.
-The harder the better.

71
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,200
- Is that a big guy?
-1.80 meters bluff.

72
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,120
Then I floor him.
How do you think I got this nose?

73
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,520
-Sure he can not fight?
-He is a writer.

74
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:16,720
-If he even opens his mouth ...
-Then I close it.

75
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,680
-I'm going to get my things.
- Do you mind?

76
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,880
He does not have that. Come on, Bill.

77
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,800
-Take the box and put everything in the bag.
-Yes Lady.

78
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,160
Not the box, just what's in it!

79
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,840
Come in! Come in!

80
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,480
Mr Waterbury's former secretary.
She quit this morning. Sit down.

81
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,960
This is my mink fur. So it so.

82
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,720
She got it from
Mr Waterbury as a Christmas bonus.

83
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,160
-My typewriter.
-It was ... New Year's bonus.

84
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,960
-Min "aujourd'hui".
-She brought it here herself.

85
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,960
-My pot.
-She ... cooks sometimes.

86
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,520
-My whiskey.
-She drank a little.

87
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,320
-My cigarette case.
-She also smoked.

88
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:38,160
-My lipstick.
- Shall we go to the library?

89
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,840
Your sausages.

90
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,160
- Goodbye, Mr Waterbury.
-Good luck for you that you did not open your mouth.

91
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,280
Come on, Bill. Do not care about
those who are inferior.

92
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,600
What can I do for you, miss?

93
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:06,040
-This is your new secretary.
-Yes, from Kilbrideskolan!

94
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,280
Look! She spilled ink
all over the carpet! It does not go away!

95
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,680
-Try to get it clean.
-No!

96
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:21,040
The hostess said that I would not
clean up anymore but just the usual.

97
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,600
-Do you want help?
-This will go well.

98
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:34,360
-I'm an expert on this.
-He gets spots like that every week.

99
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,040
-This is feminism.
-A woman did it.

100
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,600
The landlady would claim $ 100
on top of the rent in damages.

101
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,560
-I got on the dress.
-You take the carpet and I take the dress.

102
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,680
-I can take the dress.
-I'm taking the dress.

103
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,040
I'm taking the kitchen.

104
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,600
Do you like hot dogs? We take it
for lunch, and steak for dinner.

105
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,600
I have not
been interviewed yet!

106
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,760
-What's your name?
-Stephanie Gaylord. Steve.

107
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,520
We're taking her.

108
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,640
-Stenography?
-120 words per minute.

109
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,800
Do you wash? Learn to wash
120 silk shirts per minute.

110
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,960
-I'm cooking.
-And eats.

111
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,440
I live next door,
but I have no kitchen.

112
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,600
We share a kitchen,
he cooks the food and he eats.

113
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:43,600
We went to school together. I in
kindergarten and he in eighth grade.

114
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,000
When I went to high school,
he was still in kindergarten.

115
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,480
-I am in every single book.
-Who were you in my last?

116
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,760
Ballet girl
who was disappointed in life.

117
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,000
-Where did you work before?
-I?

118
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,760
Hos Charles Harris.
He owns all the "Harris Bookstores".

119
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:11,960
-How does Waterbury sell latest?
-Two after the Bible.

120
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:18,240
-Are you married?
- I do not care about that.

121
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,120
Not that?

122
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,400
My cookies are burning.

123
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,680
The secretaries' husbands
are usually a little awkward.

124
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,840
They were murderous.
He has very strange working hours.

125
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,840
That was it.

126
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,080
I did not think the
job would be like this.

127
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:57,160
Today was a bit unusual.
We will not be disturbed anymore.

128
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,760
We must work in a dignified
and cultural atmosphere.

129
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,960
Your bookmaker.

130
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,040
-Mary, he's here again!
-I heard.

131
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,280
-How much is it now then?
-Elva dollar.

132
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:24,360
No more stable tips.
Next time, I'll pull a load of ice.

133
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,800
-What are we guilty of?
-Owen 278, and you a dollar.

134
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,520
Here. I can not pay mine
until next week.

135
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,680
-Do you want to bet today?
-I'll call in that case.

136
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,120
No more 50 cent stakes.
The boss does not like it.

137
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:59,400
-Where was I?
-You talked about dignity and culture.

138
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,360
Right. Your other information ...

139
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,480
I open!

140
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:14,280
Have you interviewed my daughter Mary
Hastings for a secretarial job?

141
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,200
I have a message for you.

142
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,160
-I do not think I want the job.
-Why not?

143
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:39,800
You spoke so inspiringly
at the lecture.

144
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:46,320
Your novels are of such high quality
and have such a fine message.

145
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,120
But it's ruined now ...

146
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,520
Do not get angry ...
but try to find someone else.

147
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,080
If that's how you feel,
Miss Gaylord.

148
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:08,800
- Are you leaving Waterbury in the lurch?
-Don't ask her, call the agency.

149
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:16,080
-We both like her.
-Should I have to call the police?

150
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,960
They are probably already here.

151
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,040
I would pick up the rent.

152
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:30,160
-I sent a check this morning.
-You know that I live under you.

153
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,480
-No injuries this month?
-An uneventful month.

154
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,240
The carpet again?

155
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
Oh my God!

156
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:50,640
The fish should be here! And the duck
up here. You disturb the harmony of the room.

157
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,240
I heard you screaming.
New secretary?

158
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,840
-Employed or fired.
-New hire.

159
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:05,600
Sin. It has just moved in someone
above who would fit perfectly.

160
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,120
-The position has already been filled.
-You should meet her anyway.

161
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,000
Felicia!

162
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,080
I'm coming, Mrs Reeves.

163
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,280
This is
the famous Owen Waterbury.

164
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,200
-That's him.
-Good day.

165
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:32,760
Felicia wants to be a movie star.
Who does she remind?

166
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,840
Do not say anything. Let me guess.

167
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,000
ZaSu Pitts.

168
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:46,920
Felicia is a very good
secretary and a nice actress.

169
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,840
Take off your coat
and show them.

170
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:03,120
-She is very talented.
-I was a model in Texas.

171
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,400
But I wanted to make a career here.
Dad pays for everything.

172
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,320
-You'r friend?
-No, my father.

173
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,520
Felicia may be able to play the heroine
when your next book is filmed.

174
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,000
-How is the heroine?
-A girl from the South.

175
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:27,120
-I'm from the South!
-What a coincidence!

176
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:32,280
She's trying to catch a rich man,
she's not serious ...

177
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,560
... and silly.

178
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,960
-What is it?
- I can imagine unserious ...

179
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,400
-... but silly ...
-It works out.

180
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,760
-You can play silly, right?
-I can try.

181
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,520
I go to theater school. There maybe
I can learn to be silly.

182
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,040
-If you study hard.
-It requires a lot of work.

183
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,680
I have not started writing it yet.
I get interrupted all the time.

184
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,760
We'll let you work. I have 50
guests tonight. You entertain well?

185
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,840
Is it informal or should I swim?

186
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:22,320
If you are not in charge of the entertainment
at my parties, you have to pay the rent.

187
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,240
-Now I go to the races.
-You do not have a chance.

188
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,800
She inherited seven properties
from her husband and now she snoops constantly.

189
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,920
I stayed so as
not to embarrass you in front of the hostess.

190
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,480
-But I'm going to go now.
-What an idea!

191
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,840
-Write this down.
-Write it down, where's the block?

192
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,880
I need a pen.

193
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,840
Wait, I have a pen here.

194
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:30,280
We call it
"Notes for my new novel".

195
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,560
That's enough for the moment.
Tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.

196
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,040
He incubates. Finally he broods.

197
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,480
-Is he always like that before a book?
-Yes always.

198
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,600
At the post for "Last
Year's Love" I made a cake.

199
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:59,880
Suddenly he called out to me
and I had to take the dictation.

200
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:06,040
At three o'clock at night
we had to eat ash with chocolate.

201
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,640
See you at ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

202
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,320
I could not wait
so I call myself.

203
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,800
-How is the job?
-I ... have to learn a little.

204
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,560
-It ... is a very unusual job.
-I can imagine.

205
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,960
-He has started a new novel.
-What is it about?

206
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:56,920
He did not get that far, but it will
certainly be good. He's so enthusiastic.

207
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,040
-Should we have dinner this week?
-I call when I'm free.

208
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,800
A VIRTUAL WOMAN
Stephanie Gaylord

209
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,840
A CONFUSED WOMAN

210
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,480
Good morning!

211
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:02,320
-What you are up early!
-It's ten o'clock.

212
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,680
Have you never imagined in mink?

213
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,960
Keep the pen ready, the genius gets dressed.

214
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:17,240
I make mashed potatoes for lunch.
I go out to the kitchen and iron.

215
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,680
Good morning, Steve. In time and everything.

216
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,200
Let's see now ... What did we write yesterday?

217
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,400
"Notes for my new novel."

218
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,800
I open.

219
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,120
Hi.

220
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
Hi.

221
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,960
Hi.

222
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,880
-Hello.
-Hello.

223
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,360
-What did we write?
- "Notes on my new book."

224
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:05,200
Write "Notes for My
New Novel, by Owen Waterbury".

225
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,280
-Great! - Is it not?
- Fantastic!

226
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,640
Chapter one:
presentation of the novel characters.

227
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:22,200
-Chapter Two ... I'll take it tomorrow.
-A chapter a day! Are you tired now?

228
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:30,200
Can you answer the phone? I go
to the beach and get some sea air.

229
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,800
- Shall we go to Santa Barbara?
-Wherever you want.

230
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,520
Do not care about him.
He's trying to make you jealous.

231
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,440
Why do you think I'm
even interested in him?

232
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,440
Are you angry that you
have been given time off today?

233
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:59,560
It's done. I can't sit here
idle. I came here to work.

234
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,640
I came here to
do nothing and now I work.

235
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,400
You get paid to be unemployed.
Take care, you idiot!

236
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,960
There smoked another!

237
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,160
May I ask you something?

238
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,000
Is Mr Waterbury
really going to write a book?

239
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,600
Interesting question. Waterbury
is a genius. What do you think he's doing now?

240
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:49,960
-Ruvar.
-When he feels like this, something good happens.

241
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:55,120
-He's probably writing a lot tonight.
-Are you jealous?

242
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:02,080
I do not even know Mr Waterbury.
And I do not know if I want to.

243
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,440
-What am I doing wrong?
-All. Ge hit.

244
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,080
-How can you get so many folds?
-I think he does it best.

245
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,320
-There are nice shirts.
- They were.

246
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:31,040
I just came to think of something.
I have to be completely out of my mind!

247
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:39,160
I have studied for a year to
become a writer and stand and iron!

248
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,040
It's not clear yet.

249
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,720
It's Owen Waterbury.

250
00:25:53,800 --> 00:26:00,600
Come tomorrow morning at nine o'clock.
Finally I have a spread.

251
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,800
Good spread.
No horse can beat him.

252
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,360
-Good morning.
-Keep the coat on. The taxi is here.

253
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,440
-Where are we going?
-The horse races.

254
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,240
-I've never been there.
-Good, beginner tour.

255
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,560
-But the spread ...
-We take it after the third race.

256
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,640
-I can not follow.
-You get paid! Come now.

257
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,600
What happened...?

258
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,440
That was not a good tip.

259
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,800
-The job has cost me 83 dollars.
-You should get it back.

260
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,000
-No! I played and lost.
-Losing is good for the soul.

261
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,240
We have the three best souls in town.

262
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,040
-Good morning.
-The planet takes off in 35 minutes.

263
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,560
-Where?
-To Las Vegas and win $ 83.

264
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:05,280
-I can 't go to Las Vegas!
-Are you complaining that you get paid?

265
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,960
I can not afford to work
for you anymore, Mr Waterbury.

266
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,800
-It only takes an hour and a half.
-You have time to go home for dinner.

267
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,720
-With lots of money.
-No, I'm not going!

268
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,960
Seven, you lose.

269
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,760
No dollars!
We're not in Los Angeles here.

270
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,640
Come on, now it's time.

271
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,520
Bet on four.

272
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,080
-Four!
- Seven, you're losing.

273
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,520
Right side now again?

274
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,640
-When are we leaving?
-I have lost 3,000!

275
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,720
-We would take the twelfth plane.
-It goes at one o'clock as well.

276
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,520
I thought that job
would be uplifting.

277
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,760
Craps, you lose!

278
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,160
- Did you see what you did?
-I did nothing.

279
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,360
I bet on craps.

280
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,640
It was going to be so intellectual.

281
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,120
-Craps again!
-Do you do it on purpose?

282
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,680
-What have I done?
-It's nice, stump.

283
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,440
-She bets on craps.
- Can't you hit something else?

284
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:50,160
I would
only meet literary people.

285
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,240
Craps!

286
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,560
I've never seen that before.

287
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,760
No more craps.
Think about what you do when you throw.

288
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,640
Put everything on the seventh.
Now she has to do it.

289
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,800
-I also write a novel.
-Craps!

290
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,360
-What is it?
-Think about what you do when you throw!

291
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,960
How dare you talk to me like that ?!
You can throw yourself.

292
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,640
Craps!

293
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,800
IM rich! Here with the money.

294
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,360
-Miss Gaylord! Where are you going, Steve?
-Home. I never want to see you again.

295
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:46,920
You're a cheap, selfish scam.
I do not want to deal with you.

296
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,040
Why should I meet you?
The image of the author is destroyed.

297
00:30:54,120 --> 00:31:00,360
You must not go home alone, I
will follow you. I want to talk to you.

298
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:09,000
A person can be completely changed
when she starts playing.

299
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:14,760
-I am terribly sorry.
-Then stop, and start working.

300
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,960
-I think I'm scared.
-For what?

301
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,560
Afraid I'm not
the great writer I used to be.

302
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:30,520
I'm just a
commercial dozen writers.

303
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:37,120
Did you not see how everyone at the university
treated you with respect?

304
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,520
-Write a love novel again.
-It's going backwards.

305
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:48,360
Stay tuned. Think of the
clown who wanted to play Hamlet.

306
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,480
If you tell yourself that you
are a failure, you will be.

307
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:59,040
- Do you still work for me in that case?
-If you work, I work too.

308
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,640
I'm poor again.
I switched to sevens.

309
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,480
It's open! Come in!

310
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,600
Hi, Steve. Keep the coat on, the
taxi will arrive in a minute.

311
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,440
We will work
in the house on the beach.

312
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:44,760
He is superstitious
and always starts writing there.

313
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:50,560
Didn't you like "Last Year's
Love"? Most of it came to that.

314
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:56,280
-Should I take the typewriter?
-No, I'm dictating today.

315
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,520
Come on, Steve.

316
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:09,320
I dictate a draft
and then refine it.

317
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:14,440
A successful writer
who was going under ...

318
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:19,120
... morally and spiritually,
until a girl appeared.

319
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,240
Then everything became different.

320
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,560
He had seen her
during a lecture one evening.

321
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:32,440
He glimpsed a lot of faces
in front of him, but only saw hers.

322
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:36,680
Longing and wonderfully beautiful.

323
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,640
He said nothing but hired
her as a secretary.

324
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:48,200
At that very moment, he knew that
he was hopelessly in love with her.

325
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:54,760
One day they would work in the beach
house where he wanted to tell everything-

326
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:01,120
-but he did not dare.
Do not interrupt me when I work!

327
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:08,320
-Where was I?
- "He did not dare to tell."

328
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:17,400
She sat in front of him ...
soft and brittle like a poem.

329
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,160
He had looked around the corner
and there he had found her.

330
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,760
-What is it?
-I dropped the pen.

331
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,840
Shall we continue?

332
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:37,920
He ... wanted to take her in his arms and
pull her to him, but did not dare.

333
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
He did not know her
but still he knew her.

334
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:49,680
He walked around dictating
and looking at her bow ...

335
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,320
-What is it?
-Nothing.

336
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,440
Where was I?

337
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,320
Her collar.

338
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:10,400
He looked at her wonderful hair,
blue eyes and finely shaped mouth.

339
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,480
He was inspired by
this living creature.

340
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,800
He wanted to embrace her, kiss
her and drown in her soul.

341
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,680
But ... he was cowardly.

342
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,360
-What do you think?
-It ... can be anything.

343
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,240
Suddenly he released
all inhibitions ...

344
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,640
... leaned
over her and kissed her.

345
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,000
She melted in his arms
and offered no resistance.

346
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:45,320
Without words, they fell into each other's
arms in a silent embrace ...

347
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,360
You've got the wrong girl.
Now I'm leaving you.

348
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,280
Never contact me again.
You can give the salary to the next victim.

349
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:04,680
If I ever see one of
your books again, I'll burn it!

350
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:19,920
I've cooked dinner for all three of us.
Ask Steve if she likes donuts.

351
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,800
Steve has stopped.

352
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:30,280
She got pissed and went in the middle of the
dictation and slammed the door.

353
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,280
She's not smart!

354
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:39,720
I ask them to send a new one, one that
likes chicken because we'll eat it.

355
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:45,680
Do not call anyone. It will be a long time
before I start working again.

356
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,720
-Gone, I'm going to wash the keys.
-I compose.

357
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,680
I've never heard anything good from you yet.

358
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,160
There we have it! Do it again.

359
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,800
Thank you.

360
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:26,520
-What is it called? "I have a cold."
-Sing.

361
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:31,760
- I can not ...
-I just want to hear how it sounds.

362
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,280
Sad.

363
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,480
-Get water!
-In the kitchen.

364
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,800
That's where it burns!

365
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,400
This should be enough.

366
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,520
-You and your cooking.
-Your monks are exploding!

367
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:21,440
-Call the fire brigade.
-No, they just pour water.

368
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,160
This is
what I'll tell the hostess.

369
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,920
-I'm not going to clean up.
-Then you get no pie.

370
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,680
-What's in the trash?
-Pie.

371
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,800
30 failures out of 31 attempts.

372
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,440
31 failures.

373
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,160
We have the grilled chicken.

374
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,320
-What is it?
-Grilled chicken.

375
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,880
Made it in the pressure cooker.
It melted a little.

376
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,800
-He's probably eating out tonight.
-I also. I'm not eating this.

377
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,240
-Hey, Owen.
-He has fried chicken for you.

378
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:27,760
It is my duty as your domestic worker
to talk about what happened in the kitchen.

379
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:33,320
-Mr Ronny was setting fire to the kitchen.
-He can suck on the whole floor.

380
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:39,800
-There you got so you kept quiet.
-I'm going to tell the hostess.

381
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:49,680
-What happened in the beach house?
-Don't ask so stupid. She's quit.

382
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,600
-How did she dare?
-There are more secretaries.

383
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:59,040
Equally good at fishing
and just as sweet.

384
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,520
You never got to know
how well she typed.

385
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:07,920
-I'm calling the agency.
-No, I know something better.

386
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,040
I'm going to pack.

387
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,560
I'm going to New York.
Environmental change.

388
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,120
I work better there.
Terminates the floor ....

389
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,040
-What about me?!
-What do you think?

390
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:27,360
I'm not going to let a little
secretary get me off balance.

391
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,640
I also want to live,
a wonderful, exciting life.

392
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:37,360
I have a fantastic book inside me,
with intensity and breadth.

393
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:44,760
I'm actually happy about this. Now I
stand with my feet on the ground again.

394
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,840
It can still be used.

395
00:40:52,600 --> 00:41:00,240
Elsie called and apologized for
running away and for the driver.

396
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:06,040
Tomorrow Steve calls and
apologizes, but then I'm gone.

397
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:11,400
Why am I running away?
I'm not afraid of her.

398
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:16,640
-Then a true Owen Waterbury sounds.
-We invite Elsie to dinner.

399
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,280
We go out and eat with them all.
one every night.

400
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,720
Bryant's detective agency?
This is Owen Waterbury.

401
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:49,640
I want you to shadow a girl,
Stepahnie Gaylord.

402
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,600
-Tonight we'll have a nice time.
-Happily for me.

403
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,560
Good evening.

404
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:02,160
Why here? You've always
disliked Ridgely Room.

405
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,280
- He's kidding.
-Sure he dislikes it?

406
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:11,320
-Yes, I do too.
- A gentleman is looking for you, Mr Waterbury.

407
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,000
Go and sit down with Elsie
and I'll be here soon.

408
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:19,600
Yes, but do not go.
Do not let Elsie pay the bill again.

409
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,840
-Where is he?
-In alcove number two.

410
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,680
Is that him?

411
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:35,480
-You wanted to talk to me.
-Bryant's detective agency. Devony.

412
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:42,400
-That went quick.
-She is sitting with the man there.

413
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,200
Should I find out who he is?
Then I shadow them both.

414
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,880
Find out all you can.
She seems in love with him.

415
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,480
-Is it your wife?
-My secretary.

416
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:00,960
-Don't let anyone notice this.
-Not even you will notice anything.

417
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,320
-Check her past.
-It's going to be expensive.

418
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:11,440
We've checked out a girl. It took a
year before the past caught up.

419
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,560
-Do a good job.
-Yes, pay my bill.

420
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,240
-Cigarettes?
-A package, please.

421
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,520
Hey, Steve!

422
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:06,000
-Silence, I'm mad at her.
-Oh, I forgot.

423
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,400
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

424
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:16,760
-Do you know him?
-My new boss.

425
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:23,040
-Charles Harris, the bookseller.
-Steve's old boss.

426
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:29,280
-He's not that old.
-How dare you work for him?

427
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,680
- Do you have to take her old boss?
-She took mine!

428
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,200
Mr Harris wanted someone
with a literary background.

429
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,120
You've only worked for Waterbury.

430
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:47,960
-Steve is out with his former boss.
-Who is Elsie out with then?

431
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,840
Talk about Steve and keep me out.

432
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,240
Harris has probably hired you
to spy on me.

433
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:02,920
-I'm an excellent secretary.
-When did you learn to type?

434
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,840
-Has he asked about me?
-Just the usual about my experience.

435
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,880
-You did not say anything, did you?
-Stop joking about everything.

436
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,600
I can tell you something funny.
They will get married.

437
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,600
-What did you say?!
-They will get married!

438
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,240
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to talk to her.

439
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,720
-Grilled chicken.
-And my lord?

440
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,080
I also take a glass.

441
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,120
-Hi.
-Good evening.

442
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:45,240
-Mr Harris, Mr Waterbury.
-Congratulations, I just heard that.

443
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:51,720
You are getting married to Stephanie.
Can I dance with the bride?

444
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,000
-Thanks.
-By all means.

445
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:04,960
-So she married the wrong guy.
-Are you going to dictate a novel again?

446
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:11,840
-Why do you take someone you do not love?
-I'm not getting married to anyone.

447
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:17,920
-Now I respect you.
-Yes and everyone who does not want to get married.

448
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:25,080
- Are you going to work for him again?
-Is it quiz or dance?

449
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:28,200
We can do both.

450
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:33,400
- Do you want your old job back?
-No.

451
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,360
I'm giving you a bonus. We are getting married.

452
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,480
To you, it sounds like
marriage was cheap and vulgar.

453
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:48,920
Only Owen Waterbury invites one
and dances with another.

454
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,280
Give back and invite Mr. Harris.

455
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:59,200
-I would never dance with the boss.
- Are you telling me that?

456
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,720
Not until I had
worked for him for a few days.

457
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,080
So nice.

458
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:13,360
I can finally
hold you in my arms.

459
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,600
-We dance!
-Yes, yes, but I like you.

460
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:24,000
-You'll be back, like the tide.
-You're crazy!

461
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:29,760
Everything I said in the beach house was true,
but I did not dare admit it.

462
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:33,560
I love you.
Marry me, dare chance.

463
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:39,440
The author is looking for words.
I love you, marry me.

464
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,560
Lady's chicken.

465
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,520
Chicken in a glass for the gentleman.

466
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,680
Harris looks lonely.

467
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,160
Mr Harris,
this is Ronnie Hastings.

468
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,480
Do you not want to sit down
and have a glass of grilled chicken?

469
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:43,720
Have you heard the story
of the unholy three?

470
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:51,600
-Sorry, I'm going home.
- Can you drive me home?

471
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,360
-What about me?
-Watch the show.

472
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,800
-Shall We Dance?
-Most gladly!

473
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,200
- Are you a gigolo?
-I'll probably start with that tonight.

474
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:43,000
Life is strange. When
you wake up you never know what you will do in the evening.

475
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,400
Oh dear!

476
00:49:53,480 --> 00:50:00,880
Also order a Remington
typewriter for the other office.

477
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,920
Mr Harris' office. A moment.

478
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,840
Hello? Yes.

479
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:12,800
What ?! When then?

480
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,440
Thank you, goodbye.

481
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:29,280
-Did something sad happen?
-Waterbury and Steve are married.

482
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,320
- He did not!
-Yes then.

483
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,040
-Imagine she took him!
-Imagine he got married!

484
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:46,000
In front.
Welcome to the honeymoon.

485
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,080
Congratulations!

486
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:58,000
May I
be the first to kiss the bride?

487
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:03,160
- Am I the first?
-The bride is a little sleepy.

488
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:07,520
-How long have you been driving?
-Las Vegas round trip.

489
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:12,920
-Whose bags are these?
-Felicias. Now she does not want to stay.

490
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,840
-Talk about threshold. Three stories.
-Take the threshold up there.

491
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:24,880
-Hi Felicia.
-Congratulations. You did well.

492
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,240
I'll help you move in
when I helped Felicia out.

493
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,880
Can't move into the
gate next door?

494
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,200
To the home of old ladies.

495
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:48,480
-Hey, Mary.
-I'm so happy for you.

496
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:52,200
-Thank you, Mary! - Strange of her.
-Yes.

497
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,440
-Hello Darling.
-Hi Sweetheart.

498
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:02,000
"Your luggage,
madam and sir."

499
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:09,080
I've made a wedding breakfast.
Spaghetti with meatballs.

500
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:15,920
That was kind of you, but we want to
be alone on our honeymoon.

501
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:23,480
Be kind to him, Steve.
He is my livelihood.

502
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:35,800
-Are you glad you married me?
- Are you asking that now?

503
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:40,760
It was a moment of inspiration
and you are so changeable ...

504
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:45,720
I never change about you.
You're the best thing that ever happened to me.

505
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,400
-Where is floor 3 E?
-Who are you looking for?

506
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,680
It only applies to those on floor 3 E.

507
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,840
Next floor in the corridor.

508
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,360
Excuse.

509
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,680
-Yes?
-I want to talk to Mr Waterbury.

510
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,200
He does not want to be disturbed
right now. He...

511
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:33,000
-... he's a little busy.
-My name is Devony.

512
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:37,680
Say that the woman
he is interested in has married.

513
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,400
Owen!

514
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,120
Can you come for a while?

515
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,720
What's the matter now?

516
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:59,880
A Devony came here and
said he wanted to talk to you.

517
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:05,480
He said the woman you
were interested in got married.

518
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:17,240
-Are you interested in a married woman?
-There is only one.

519
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:32,880
-I want to see Mr Waterbury right away.
-Owen!

520
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,440
The awful chicken is here!
- That's what we say in all kindness.

521
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,080
-What's the matter now?
-Excuse!

522
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:46,720
I did not know
that your secretary worked overtime.

523
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:52,920
-They are married.
-Married? Then she should hear this.

524
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,280
-What can I do for you?
-I would pick up the rent.

525
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:03,800
-I paid the first one.
-There are new rules now.

526
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,840
I do not take checks without coverage.

527
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,680
-Shen when?
-Since you moved in.

528
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,520
- Do you have $ 485 in the bank?
-I think so.

529
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:21,880
Can you write a check
so I can sort this out?

530
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:27,920
-How can I have so little money?
-6,000 on dice.

531
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,560
-Two dollars for marriage license.
-You have to live.

532
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,680
Thanks honey.

533
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:46,040
Thank you Mrs Waterbury. I did not
think I would call Mrs Waterbury.

534
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:49,560
-I'm following you out.
-Thank you, Ronnie.

535
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,680
- Does it have coverage?
-She's tight.

536
00:55:55,240 --> 00:56:02,440
An explanation is in place.
Yes, I absolutely want to explain.

537
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,400
Excuse.

538
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,360
-Hey, Owen.
-Congratulations, we just found out.

539
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:18,960
Thanks Birdie. - Darling! -
Do you not want to settle down?

540
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:27,400
Honey, this is my publisher,
Mr Folton and Birdie. - My wife.

541
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:32,040
You do not take an
extra long honeymoon, do you?

542
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:36,880
No, I was going to dictate
my honeymoon in the beach house.

543
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:42,520
You have a deadline for the novel
that you must meet. You know why.

544
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,800
-It is finished.
-I trust you.

545
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:52,000
-Do you want something to drink?
-Thank you, we are in a double lane on the street.

546
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:55,800
-How is Ronnie?
-Good apetite.

547
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:02,160
She says that when he dies, the
crematorium has to grill him slowly.

548
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:08,160
- Do you know Ronnie?
-Yes, I have also been a secretary.

549
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:15,000
Thanks for stopping by, Dick.

550
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,800
-Nice honeymoon.
-Thanks.

551
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:28,240
Why did Mr Folton
look at you so accusingly?

552
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:33,960
I owe him 20,000.
I took out an advance on the next book.

553
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:37,840
Did Mrs Folton
get her mink fur from you?

554
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,800
Birdie? I had written
a bestseller and wasted.

555
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,120
Give it
in installments to Mr Folton.

556
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,920
-You should get a hundred coats.
-I can not afford that.

557
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,080
-Your rent devours everything I have.
- Did you take me for my money?

558
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:00,960
-No, but maybe you did.
- We're leaving.

559
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:06,640
I know a cabin in the mountains where
we avoid publishers, hostesses ...

560
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:11,400
-... and secretary?
-Except you. And I'm going to work!

561
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:14,280
I'll make sure of that.

562
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:25,400
-How long have you been working on the book?
-Four months.

563
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,360
I'm pretty proud of this one.

564
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:33,920
-Where is Mrs Waterbury?
-She buys. We offer dinner.

565
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,440
Unfortunately, I can not stay.
I have to take the next train home.

566
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:47,120
-Now say what you think of the book.
-I'm going to say it outright.

567
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:52,200
-You do not like it.
-It's lousy.

568
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,320
The worst junk I've ever read.

569
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,800
You would perish
if I published this.

570
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,240
-Fortunately, I have another on lye.
- Am I out?

571
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:15,560
-No, this happens to all writers.
-I owe you money.

572
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:24,320
I got hold of deer ...
- Mr Folton! Nice to see you again.

573
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,560
- Do you like deer?
-Unfortunately I can not stay.

574
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,120
-Why not?
-An important meeting in town.

575
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:36,680
Such a shame.
I had planned to cook my specialty.

576
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:39,920
It will have to be another time.

577
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,680
Goodbye, Mrs Waterbury.
- Hi then, Owen.

578
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:51,800
-He does not like it.
-No.

579
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,880
- Do you think he's right?
-He has always had that.

580
00:59:55,960 --> 01:00:02,080
Until he married Birdie.
He may have changed.

581
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:06,560
He may see you
with different eyes.

582
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:12,800
He does not publish a book where he sees
his wife in your arms on every page.

583
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:17,240
-He only sees Birdie in the book.
-Birdie meant nothing.

584
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:23,520
He is human and man,
even though he is a publisher.

585
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:27,200
-We're leaving here tonight.
-Tonight?

586
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:34,480
You blame me for this.

587
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:41,520
Not directly. It feels strange
that your wife is a secretary too.

588
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:49,600
I need to write a new book quickly,
and ... I need a new secretary.

589
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:58,160
-Have I been fired?
-It's getting better for both of us.

590
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:03,920
Then you get a chance
to write your own book.

591
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,720
Now I'm making dinner.

592
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:19,680
-I have finished writing my book.
-Have you? Can I read it?

593
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:24,880
It's been
on your bedside table for two weeks.

594
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:29,560
-I read it on the train.
-You do not need that.

595
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,520
-You're hurt.
-No.

596
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:38,240
Call and book tickets and
ask Ronnie to find a new secretary.

597
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:04,120
Mrs Waterbury!
Have you had a nice honeymoon?

598
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:09,000
-It's nice in the mountains this year.
-Yes.

599
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:13,120
-An original Waterbury?
-The last.

600
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:19,840
-Steve! Sit down.
-Thanks.

601
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:24,080
-You look splendid.
-Four months in nature.

602
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,760
Would you do me a favor?

603
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:36,840
Folton does not like Owen's latest
book. Read it and say what you think.

604
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:41,800
-I will try to be objective.
-I know you are.

605
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:48,280
And here is my own manuscript.
It has taken a long time.

606
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:52,600
I have changed the title
so many times.

607
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:56,680
But I stuck with
"Dawn's longing."

608
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:04,080
Owen has not read it yet. He
has been busy writing.

609
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:10,600
-He could not concentrate.
-I will read both with pleasure.

610
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:13,480
Tack, Charles.

611
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:19,040
-Hi then, Steve.
-Bye.

612
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:38,520
-I can not find Waterbury on 3rd.
- Here's Mrs Waterbury.

613
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:44,760
I come from the agency.
Mr Waterbury is looking for a secretary.

614
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:48,600
That way? This way.

615
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:53,680
It will be so exciting
to work for Mr Waterbury.

616
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:02,520
-I barely had time to get dressed.
-You're so nice.

617
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:06,640
-I sew my clothes myself.
-Oh really?

618
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:13,480
Come in, miss ...
What was your name?

619
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:17,120
Hilda Schniedbacker.

620
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:21,720
This is your new secretary,
Owen.

621
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,200
This is our neighbor, Ronnie.

622
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:30,000
-Do you want something to drink?
- Do you have beer?

623
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
We have salty biscuits too.

624
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:41,080
I could
drink a whole thin beer.

625
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:47,120
-What did you ask for when you called?
-I thought they knew what we were looking for.

626
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,840
It's not necessary.

627
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:02,520
Bring the beer
and come and sit here.

628
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:08,240
-Can you wash?
-Shirts and socks, not sheets.

629
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:11,240
Have a seat.

630
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:18,520
- Do you use to play on horses?
-Yesterday I got two winners.

631
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:24,840
-Perfect! What coat size do you have?
-Do I have to wear a coat at work?

632
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:29,040
All secretaries
receive a mink coat as a Christmas present.

633
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:35,240
If I had known about it
, I could have saved the vomit.

634
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,760
Who can she mean?

635
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:42,640
I will thrive here.
You are all so quirky.

636
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:50,600
-Do you mind working overtime?
-Not at all.

637
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:54,960
I have not
seen my roommate since New Year's.

638
01:05:56,660 --> 01:06:00,460
I'm afraid
it's going to be a little too difficult for you.

639
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:05,900
Some passages are in French.
You can not do that, can you?

640
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:11,620
Dad spoke French for six years.
And I've had a French boyfriend.

641
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:15,540
Can't we have a stenographer?

642
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:21,300
-Stenograph? I can not.
- Can't you?

643
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:26,260
No, they said
it was just typing.

644
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:29,620
It's mostly shorthand.

645
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:33,900
-I can learn.
-Unfortunately not.

646
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:39,100
-Then I was out of the game.
-Put away the glass!

647
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:45,100
Thanks for the beer.

648
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:57,260
It must be next. I asked the
agency to send several pieces.

649
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:05,500
-Hello, is it floor 3 E?
-Yes.

650
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:11,060
- Does a Mr Owen Waterbury live here?
-Yes.

651
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:20,300
-I'm Owen Waterbury.
-I come from the agency.

652
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:22,500
-Dawn O'Malley.
-And.

653
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:25,660
- Come in, Miss O'Malley.
-Thanks.

654
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:30,300
Have a seat.
This is my wife.

655
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:37,740
- Do you stenograph?
-120 words per minute.

656
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:43,020
-Talar ni franska?
- "My mother was French."

657
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:47,580
"Perfect!
Tell me, Miss O'Malley ..."

658
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:53,300
-Are you married?
-I'm divorcing.

659
01:07:55,700 --> 01:08:01,060
-When do you want me to start?
-You have already started.

660
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:07,220
Shall we leave them alone and cook
lunch, Steve? They want to work.

661
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:19,380
-Have you worked for writers before?
-Yes, but I do not want to talk about it.

662
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:26,500
When I worked over time,
he became the approach. I called the police.

663
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:32,260
Publicity ruined his career.
But he begged for it.

664
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:36,300
-Don't you think so too?
-Yes, sure ...

665
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:43,380
-What about a little lunch?
-Thank you, I've already eaten.

666
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:47,700
-And you?
-I'm skipping.

667
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:56,060
You will enjoy yourself here. And
Waterburys are real bohemians.

668
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:58,140
Raw.

669
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:00,820
I open.

670
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:07,620
May I introduce
you to your new neighbor, Sylvain Scott.

671
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:14,020
-He has taken over Felicia's floor.
-I know Mr Scott.

672
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:20,300
You will meet the family's celebrity,
the great Owen Waterbury.

673
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:24,540
-And this is ...
-... the horrible Ronnie Hastings.

674
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:29,180
-New secretary!
-New hire. I'm fired.

675
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:32,220
Mr Scott is also a writer.

676
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:36,620
-We went to the same evening course.
-We sat next to each other.

677
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:42,300
Mr Scott had played ball before.
Look which shoulders. No shoulder pads.

678
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:45,220
Have you looked at the match!

679
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:50,100
He has written a radio program,
"John's Mother's Lover".

680
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:55,860
- "John's mother's girlfriend!"
-Tell me, will they get married?

681
01:09:55,940 --> 01:10:00,780
-No, John's father opposes.
-John has no father!

682
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:03,820
Poor boy.

683
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:08,780
Hurry up and write.
You must not forget John.

684
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:14,460
I have problems.
My secretary has just gotten married.

685
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:20,900
I can help you. I was
Mr Waterbury's secretary before.

686
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:24,420
-Yes exactly.
-Marriage was a bonus.

687
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:29,020
-When can you begin?
-Let's say I started.

688
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:34,340
Give me a pad and a pen, Ronnie.
- How much are we going to work tonight?

689
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:40,220
-It probably takes the whole evening.
-I'm used to working in the evening.

690
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:44,220
-Do not work too hard.
-No, I promise.

691
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:47,020
Thanks, Ronnie. - Bye.

692
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:53,500
-I must have arranged everything.
-Really.

693
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:59,740
-Then I'll go.
-And I just poisoned the tea.

694
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:02,700
Jokers there!

695
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:16,260
You will enjoy yourself very much here,
sweetheart.

696
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:21,140
Hands off! I do
not tolerate affection from anyone.

697
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:25,620
I've ruined a man's
career once. Do not forget it!

698
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:28,980
-You can take time off today.
-Take all year.

699
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:35,260
-I have not started yet.
-You get paid anyway.

700
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:39,420
-When should I come tomorrow?
-Decide yourself.

701
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:44,420
-I do not understand ...
-What about twelve o'clock?

702
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:55,300
- Did you say anything about poisoned tea?
-I mixed it up.

703
01:11:57,140 --> 01:12:02,780
-Where was I?
"You hear footsteps, three people."

704
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:11,100
You hear steps, three people.
A door slams, a door creaks.

705
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:14,620
Two shots, three screams ...

706
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:17,420
-How does that sound?
- Fantastic!

707
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,740
Uproar!

708
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:29,420
"John, I love your mother.
Tomorrow I will be your father."

709
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:36,020
John is going to be a father, and I'm
the first to know.

710
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:45,060
- "But I'm older than you, Dad."
-Is John older than his father?

711
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:53,100
-What was that?
-I wonder that too.

712
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:58,180
I do not know. But calm down,
I will not try anything.

713
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:08,060
They have just turned off the light.

714
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:18,220
It's Charles Harris. Sorry I'm
calling late. Can I talk to her?

715
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:22,700
This is her husband.
She's not home tonight.

716
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:28,460
-I do not know when she will come home.
"They just turned it off," I said.

717
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:35,420
-Can I borrow a light bulb?
-I ignore what you do.

718
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:40,780
-What is it?
-I'm going to a hotel.

719
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:46,220
-No, I do. It's your floor.
-No, you pay the rent.

720
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:48,620
Give Mr Scott this.

721
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:56,820
You're not jealous of the
man upstairs, are you ? He is inoffensive.

722
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:00,700
-You tricked me.
-Hur?

723
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:08,300
Charles Harris has just called. Have
you met him since we got home?

724
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:13,460
It's very late and
I do not want to be cross-examined.

725
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:17,980
We are adults
and must be able to trust each other.

726
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:21,740
Do not try to dodge.
Have you met him?

727
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:27,180
Yes, but it was
only for a special reason.

728
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:32,780
-He got your manuscript.
-It is too late.

729
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:40,740
At the nightclub, I noticed that you were
in love with each other. Five years is a long time.

730
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:47,660
-I've never loved Charles.
-Not me either, just a teenage idol.

731
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:53,500
I've tried to be honest with you,
but I was completely wrong.

732
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:58,020
I loved you
even before I met you.

733
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:05,260
Your way of writing, the tone, the feeling, the
quality made such an impression-

734
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:09,900
-that I imagined
you were just writing for me.

735
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:14,260
It's true I created
a schoolgirl picture of you.

736
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:20,140
I was so captivated by it that I
had gotten married after the lecture.

737
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:27,060
If you had gone down to me and
asked for my hand, you would have gotten me.

738
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:30,140
How can you say that to me?

739
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:38,140
I also put you on a pedestal.
But you tore it down in a cruel way.

740
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:43,380
You
once called me false and selfish . But yourself then?

741
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:47,940
What are you? Call him,
he's waiting for you.

742
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:06,100
-Good morning.
-I have made an appointment.

743
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:09,540
Yes, Mr Harris
has a surprise for you.

744
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:13,300
-Steve!
-Good morning, Charles.

745
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:19,540
These are Mr McNalley, Mr Hudson
and Mrs Burke from the Litterary Times.

746
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:24,620
-So you're Stephanie Gaylord.
-Sit down.

747
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:28,100
This is an important day in your life.

748
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:36,900
Mr. McNalley is the publisher
in New York. He flew here this morning.

749
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:43,300
-How long have you been writing your book?
-In five years, approximately.

750
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:49,980
I want to nominate it for the McNalley-
Windslow Award for Debutants.

751
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:56,180
-Have you shown my manuscript?
-I could not help myself.

752
01:16:56,260 --> 01:17:01,180
Do you not
understand what that means for Owen?

753
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:10,140
Owen is the family's celebrity and
his novel has been rejected.

754
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:15,660
This on top of everything
will destroy him.

755
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:21,300
He must feel important.
He has no self-confidence left.

756
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:26,460
-Do you compete with you?
-You do not understand.

757
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:31,500
Owen is in trouble and
his wife has to help him out.

758
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:35,180
I thought you
wanted to write at all costs.

759
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:41,900
I wanted to, before I got married.
What do you think of Owen's manuscript?

760
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:48,100
That's good ... But it can '
t measure up to this.

761
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:50,980
This is magnificent.

762
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:59,740
-Thank you, gentlemen.
-Sit down. I want to talk to you.

763
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:07,820
-Are you going down to the kitchen again?
-I'm helping you with the monks.

764
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:10,900
Only I have time to call the fire brigade.

765
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:15,860
-No, that's not what I said.
-Sorry.

766
01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:19,300
We will try again.

767
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:25,460
John: "Mom, I've changed my mind.
I do not like your girlfriend."

768
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:30,240
Mother: "I like him.
It's the only thing that counts."

769
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:34,600
John: "I
do not agree to the marriage".

770
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:39,200
Mother: "I'm the one to
marry him, not you".

771
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:43,100
-Uruselt.
-Amen.

772
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:47,060
You are very disturbing, Mr Hastings.

773
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:51,900
Do not use Mr Waterbury's
floor and secretary.

774
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:55,580
Mrs Waterbury is gone
and I have to finish.

775
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:59,140
-Go up to you and work.
-She does not want to.

776
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:03,260
-Work without her.
-I have to dictate.

777
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:08,680
-Why do not you want to get up?
-I do not work in men's bedrooms.

778
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:12,000
It's a bachelor party.

779
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:18,400
My husband ran a hotel. One room is
one bedroom, two or more one floor.

780
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:22,000
-There you got so you kept quiet.
-Now we work.

781
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:25,640
-Mr Waterbury.
-What do you want?

782
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:30,160
I'm Devony
from the Bryant Detective Agency .

783
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:33,600
A bill
of 845 dollars and 62 cents.

784
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:38,440
-Shadowing by Stephanie Gaylord.
-I'm married to her!

785
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:41,760
We have shadowed married women before.

786
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:47,200
- Drive him out.
-Should I call the police?

787
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:51,960
What is this?
Should my wife do your laundry?

788
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:59,800
-Isn't it a little too big for you?
- It's Mrs Waterburys. It is mine.

789
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:04,000
You have been fired for
dictating to someone else.

790
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:09,540
Nice! Even if you wrote well
, I would not work for you.

791
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:14,220
-Where is Stephanie?
-I know. Pay first.

792
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:17,780
- We need $ 845 ...
-... and 62 cents.

793
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:22,420
-Write a check.
-Yes exactly!

794
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:26,340
-Call it.
-Here is the report.

795
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:31,100
I had
to shadow you at the same time.

796
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:35,260
-Here you have Stephanie.
-Where are you Stephanie?

797
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:38,260
What are you doing there?!

798
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:43,820
There smoke our last chance
to be reconciled. Now it's over!

799
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:47,900
Harris floor.
Without the slightest shame.

800
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:56,100
-She might get the job back.
-Work in his home. It's not possible!

801
01:21:56,180 --> 01:22:02,100
- Do not talk to me about secretaries.
-Read page three in the report.

802
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:08,660
Call the agency. Now I
want a good and efficient girl.

803
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:15,340
-She can look any way.
-Anyway, only she's good looking.

804
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:23,340
-Can you shorthand?
-Yes, 120 words a minute.

805
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:28,300
-What was your name?
-Miss Dove.

806
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:33,580
-Miss Dove.
-Everyone says I'm volatile.

807
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:39,820
-Where did you work before?
-I have graduated from secretarial school.

808
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:44,220
I want to be a writer one day.

809
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:48,220
-Have you been married?
-No! Never!

810
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:54,420
-Can you imagine working on weekends?
-Yes, I only have myself.

811
01:22:54,500 --> 01:23:00,820
Do you not think that
Mr Waterbury is a fine writer?

812
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:04,420
This is a clay pigeon.

813
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:08,420
I'm going to get my things. Come on, Bill.

814
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:13,100
-I know where it is.
-Empty the drawer in the bag.

815
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:18,500
-I knew you were coming.
-Just a moment.

816
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:21,900
-Where is the mink fur?
-I got none.

817
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:25,660
-In the bedroom.
-Is there a mink shortage?

818
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:30,380
- Haven't you been here before?
-Sure, with the former.

819
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:36,620
If you need a taxi, you
just need to open the window and shout.

820
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:40,340
His former secretary.

821
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:46,020
You do not love Harris
but you go home to him.

822
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:51,620
-Can you give me a sensible explanation?
-It does not matter now.

823
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:56,060
-She is very personal.
- Skilled typist.

824
01:23:56,140 --> 01:24:00,940
-Charles Harris floor, without further ado.
-Was there anything else?

825
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:03,420
My photo.

826
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:11,020
-If I were a man ...
-... we would settle outside.

827
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:13,940
Hit me. I challenge you.

828
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:17,100
- Did he hit her?
-He hit her.

829
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:24,180
You were offended because I
liked your novel and said so.

830
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:28,620
The problem was that
you thought you had wasted your time.

831
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:35,900
I'll write a book about you.
"The tuber and his victim."

832
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:41,060
Goodbye, Owen Waterbury.
I never want to know about you again.

833
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:43,900
I say that too.

834
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:50,700
-Where is Miss Duva?
-She flew out of the cage.

835
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:56,660
-Where do you think Steve is going?
-She marries Harris.

836
01:24:56,740 --> 01:25:02,220
Now I'm leaving too. I'm so angry
I could get married.

837
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:07,700
-Who are you going to marry?
-A woman, I know so much.

838
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:18,460
She went home to Harris.
I was disguised as a window pusatre.

839
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:25,220
Elsie was there. It probably meant nothing.
Then Harris took Stephanie's hand.

840
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:42,300
I'm looking for Mr Harris.
Owen Waterbury.

841
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:48,100
Excuse me, sir!

842
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:52,660
Sorry, I did not want to disturb you
and my secretary.

843
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:58,700
-Is a former secretary.
-You are probably in the middle of dictation.

844
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:04,580
You know what I think of someone who
behaves that way towards the secretary.

845
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:09,180
-Charles and I'm getting married.
-Congratulations.

846
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:13,940
What do you think my wife thinks of it?
She loves you.

847
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:20,140
-Stephanie is too good for you.
-What a raw person you are.

848
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:25,260
Your motives are obvious.
You've been tormenting me since we got married.

849
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:31,100
I came here to make up.
Raise your fists and defend yourself.

850
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:35,860
Listen to me, you idiot.
Why do you think Stephanie came here?

851
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:40,020
Harris wants to publish a
novel she has written.

852
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:44,540
But she was afraid to hurt you
and crash your marriage.

853
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:50,860
I read your book that Folton
did not want to publish. It's great.

854
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:56,580
Folton is just jealous of
Birdie. It's your own fault.

855
01:26:56,660 --> 01:27:02,540
One day, Stephanie will
be a better writer than you.

856
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:06,580
Read Stephanie's novel
and get really jealous.

857
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:11,340
You will not get her back.
She's gone and it's right for you.

858
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:15,060
Hope I
've kicked some sense into you.

859
01:27:15,140 --> 01:27:17,820
Goodbye, Mr Waterbury.

860
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:37,980
Stephanie Gaylord wins the
McNally Award for Debutants

861
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:54,140
Stephanie Gaylord
signs at 3 today

862
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:16,140
Mr Waterbury?
I would give you this.

863
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:20,100
Mrs Waterbury is seeking a divorce.

864
01:28:36,380 --> 01:28:39,380
-Three. And you?
-Fyra C.

865
01:28:42,660 --> 01:28:47,380
- Is not that Sylvain Scott's floor?
-I do not know.

866
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:50,460
I'm the new secretary.

867
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:57,180
Good luck.

868
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:05,380
-Mr Waterbury!
-Hej, Mary.

869
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:13,420
-Do you want a drink?
-Maybe it.

870
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:21,500
- Have you seen Ronnie?
-No, not in three days.

871
01:29:21,580 --> 01:29:24,580
He must have gotten married.

872
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:31,220
-He did not even invite me to the wedding.
-Not me either.

873
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:35,820
So Ronnie got married.

874
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:39,780
And I'm going to divorce.
Did you know that?

875
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:45,300
- Mrs Waterbury wants a divorce.
-It was sad to hear.

876
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:50,620
He was a nice man.
So were you ... sometimes.

877
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:53,140
Thanks, Mary.

878
01:29:54,940 --> 01:29:59,020
Scott has hired
a male secretary.

879
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:05,580
-Mr Scott moved yesterday.
-Who lives up there then?

880
01:30:05,660 --> 01:30:08,580
Mrs Waterbury.

881
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:12,300
-Steve ?!
-Yes, she's a great writer.

882
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:16,060
I'll probably take care of her!
This is not possible.

883
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:32,660
Come in. - What can I do for you?

884
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:37,020
-Out! Out, I said!
-I do not understand...

885
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:40,300
- Ignore him.
-This is my wife.

886
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:44,020
Have you not received the divorce papers?

887
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:49,180
You are my wife until it
goes through and it takes a year.

888
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:55,340
-Come back tomorrow at 9.
-I see you here again you go out!

889
01:30:56,540 --> 01:31:03,700
-Male secretary right in front of me.
-Above you, darling.

890
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:10,100
-Why did you take this floor?
-I found nothing else.

891
01:31:10,180 --> 01:31:12,580
Try it.

892
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:16,700
I thought
you would think I was chasing you.

893
01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:24,300
But we can be good neighbors,
greeting each other in the corridor.

894
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:29,820
I politely visited
your friend Harris very recently.

895
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:34,940
Elsie was there.
She told me about your book.

896
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:39,580
That you did not want to publish it,
because it could hurt me.

897
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:44,140
That was the dumbest thing!
Do you think I'm looking at you as a rival?

898
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:51,580
-Don't you think I can compete with you?
-I read your book last night.

899
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:55,900
Do you know something? You're better than me.

900
01:31:55,980 --> 01:31:59,620
But do not tell anyone,
then I deny it.

901
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:05,940
Listen to me. I am also human
and have certain rights.

902
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:10,700
I had a spread and
you chased away the secretary.

903
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:15,620
You can dictate to me.
I can shorthand.

904
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:21,660
Do you know something?
I'm a better secretary than you.

905
01:32:21,740 --> 01:32:25,020
Prove it.
Front with pad and pencil.

906
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:30,860
Not another word about us
before we have written this down.

907
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:35,660
We call it
"notes for my new novel" -

908
01:32:35,740 --> 01:32:39,700
-"av Stephanie Gaylord."

909
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:47,540
It's about a girl who
became the secretary of a great egoist.

910
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:51,820
He thought
he knew everything about life.

911
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:56,020
Do not interrupt me!

912
01:32:56,100 --> 01:33:02,100
He was attractive ...
in an ugly way.

913
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:05,420
Stop interrupting me!

914
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:11,260
But he was full of
childish frustration and complex

915
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:14,580
-as she was
stupid enough to try to cure.

916
01:33:14,660 --> 01:33:20,740
-I'm not going to sit here ...
-This is my new book!

917
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:27,460
Until she suddenly discovered
that he did not need a wife.

918
01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:31,180
He needed a ... psychiatrist!

919
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:37,140
That's enough! Would I be crazy?
I'm suing you if you publish the book.

920
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:40,020
Do it! If you think I ...

921
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:42,220
Hi.

922
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:46,700
Interesting. But I wonder one thing.
Did she love him?

923
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:51,020
It's done!
Deep, devoted, desperate.

924
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:53,900
Why did you not say that?

925
01:33:56,020 --> 01:34:00,940
-I would pick up the rent.
-Ronnie is your new host.

926
01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:08,660
No, that vase should be up there!
And this one belongs here.

927
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:12,140
-And this one belongs here.
-Ronnie, stop!
