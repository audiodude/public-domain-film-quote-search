1
00:00:01,096 --> 00:00:03,763
(siren wailing)

2
00:01:11,052 --> 00:01:12,802
- Get over there you.

3
00:01:13,903 --> 00:01:15,247
- Now don't say what's your hurry.

4
00:01:15,247 --> 00:01:18,830
- Yeah, and don't ask
us where the fire is.

5
00:01:20,584 --> 00:01:22,500
- Didn't you guys see me wave at ya?

6
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,329
- Well we waved back, didn't we?
- Yeah, he did like this, I saw him.

7
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:27,893
- Shut up, you broke a traffic law.

8
00:01:27,893 --> 00:01:30,335
- Well can't you make another one?

9
00:01:30,335 --> 00:01:33,601
- I'm gonna give both you guys a ticket.

10
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:36,702
Well be sure they're down front,
my partner doesn't see very well.

11
00:01:36,702 --> 00:01:39,837
- Yeah, my glasses--
- Don't try to kid me.

12
00:01:39,837 --> 00:01:41,993
It's guys like you that keep us cops busy.

13
00:01:41,993 --> 00:01:43,463
Don't you ever think of accidents?

14
00:01:43,463 --> 00:01:45,149
- Accidents?
- Accidents?

15
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:46,926
- My dear man, that's our business.

16
00:01:46,926 --> 00:01:48,157
Well allow me.

17
00:01:48,157 --> 00:01:49,790
- Accidents.

18
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,953
- My card, my card.

19
00:01:51,953 --> 00:01:55,003
- Boswell and Ganzy, insurance eh?

20
00:01:55,003 --> 00:01:57,247
- Yes ah, this is Mr. Boswell.

21
00:01:57,247 --> 00:01:59,081
Mr. Boswell shake hands
with Mr. Policeman.

22
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:01,616
- I'm pleased to meet you,
and this is Mr. Ganzy.

23
00:02:01,616 --> 00:02:03,693
Mr. Ganzy shake hands with Mr. Policeman.

24
00:02:03,693 --> 00:02:05,924
- I'm pleased to meet you
sir, I am pleased to meet you.

25
00:02:05,924 --> 00:02:08,445
Now here's a policy that
offers triple protection

26
00:02:08,445 --> 00:02:10,437
against boozers,
earthquakes and relatives.

27
00:02:10,437 --> 00:02:11,903
- Have you ever stopped to realize

28
00:02:11,903 --> 00:02:13,813
that old age is creeping up on you?

29
00:02:13,813 --> 00:02:15,481
- My dear man you owe it to your wife.

30
00:02:15,481 --> 00:02:17,719
- I haven't got a wife.
- We'll get you one.

31
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:20,322
- Yes, now eh, I would like
to ask you a few questions.

32
00:02:20,322 --> 00:02:22,417
Ah, how's your liver?
- What?

33
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:23,714
- Now don't tell me you
haven't got a liver.

34
00:02:23,714 --> 00:02:25,465
- But I don't need any insurance.

35
00:02:25,465 --> 00:02:27,989
- You are just the type
that does need insurance.

36
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:30,428
Why do you realize that's
since nineteen hundred and ten

37
00:02:30,428 --> 00:02:32,770
they have discovered 52 new ways of dying?

38
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,173
- (sighs) And you don't look well.

39
00:02:35,173 --> 00:02:38,190
- Yes, why ah ah, people
are dying this year

40
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,818
that have never died before.

41
00:02:39,818 --> 00:02:42,440
- Well what kind of insurance do you do?
- Any kind.

42
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,730
Now answer me, answer me.
In the morning when you get up

43
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,101
do you sort of have an
empty feeling in here?

44
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,259
- Ah, come to think of it I believe I do.

45
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:51,842
- Just as I thought, gallstone.

46
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:02,996
Ah, another prospect.

47
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:04,829
- And what a prospect.

48
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:09,108
- Hey, give her sales talk number seven,

49
00:03:09,108 --> 00:03:11,754
and don't come back without a policy.

50
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:14,525
Now then where were we?
Oh yes, around the gallstone area.

51
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:18,388
Why man do you realize that you've got
enough gallstones to start a quarry?

52
00:03:22,344 --> 00:03:24,010
- Hello.
- Hello.

53
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:27,430
- Are em, are we holding you up?

54
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,646
- Yes, and I'm awfully angry about it.

55
00:03:30,646 --> 00:03:32,974
- Ah, what's your name?

56
00:03:32,974 --> 00:03:34,557
- Mary, Mary Marsh.

57
00:03:35,454 --> 00:03:38,121
- Mary, gee that's a swell name.

58
00:03:39,436 --> 00:03:41,227
My name is Wilbur.

59
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:44,141
- I don't mind.
- Aw.

60
00:03:45,342 --> 00:03:48,513
- Now eh, let's see your tongue.

61
00:03:48,513 --> 00:03:50,589
Say ah.
- Ah.

62
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:54,572
- Just as I thought, you
reached me just in time.

63
00:03:54,572 --> 00:03:56,770
- Has it got a coat on it?

64
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:01,123
- Not only a coat, but a
vest and a pair of pants.

65
00:04:01,123 --> 00:04:05,853
- You know Mary, you're the
kind of a girl that I could--

66
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:07,520
- Hey, number seven!

67
00:04:11,477 --> 00:04:15,297
- Have you ever stopped to realize
that old age is creeping up on you?

68
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,557
- What're you talking about?

69
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,476
- Protection, that's what you need.

70
00:04:18,476 --> 00:04:19,859
Throughout your declining years

71
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,688
you will need to be provided for,

72
00:04:21,688 --> 00:04:24,861
and I am here to offer
you that protection.

73
00:04:24,861 --> 00:04:26,729
- Well that's awfully nice of you,

74
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:29,412
and, and I think you're (giggles).

75
00:04:29,412 --> 00:04:31,771
Well, you'll have to let me
think it over for awhile.

76
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,622
- Oh that is the trouble
with America today,

77
00:04:34,622 --> 00:04:38,122
procrastinaty, procras em, why give it up?

78
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,847
Accept my proposition now,

79
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,285
and know the value of a steady income,

80
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:45,809
and the happiness of a contented family.

81
00:04:45,809 --> 00:04:47,485
- Well, I just met you,

82
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:49,764
and I think I could like you an awful lot,

83
00:04:49,764 --> 00:04:52,534
and I think we could be
awfully happy together,

84
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:54,731
and well, I might except your proposal,

85
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:58,148
but well you'd have to ask Mother anyway.

86
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:02,825
- Now that I've signed this policy,

87
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:04,532
suppose I got double pneumonemia?

88
00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:07,398
- Aw, then you would be lucky.
- Lucky?

89
00:05:07,398 --> 00:05:10,516
- Certainly, because then
you'll get a great bargain.

90
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:13,042
Instead of dealing with
you in the singular,

91
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:15,375
we pay you off in deploracy.

92
00:05:16,793 --> 00:05:18,134
- Oh I see.

93
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:21,309
- (laughs) Good luck, you'll need it.

94
00:05:21,309 --> 00:05:25,048
- I'm certainly glad I met you fellas.

95
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:28,296
- Mary, I want you to meet my partner,

96
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:30,576
Mr. J. Addington Ganzy.

97
00:05:30,576 --> 00:05:32,744
This is Mary Marsh.
- [Mary] How do you do?

98
00:05:32,744 --> 00:05:34,639
- Fidget the digit,
honey, fidget the digit.

99
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,706
You know I love the name
of Marsh, it's so mellow.

100
00:05:37,706 --> 00:05:39,418
Has uh, has my partner been telling you

101
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:40,922
of our wonderful insurance?

102
00:05:40,922 --> 00:05:43,932
- Ooh, is that what he was talking about?

103
00:05:43,932 --> 00:05:49,353
Well not exactly, you see I eh,
tell us something about yourself Mary.

104
00:05:49,353 --> 00:05:52,534
- Well, I'm running away from home.
- [Wilbur And Addington] No.

105
00:05:52,534 --> 00:05:56,969
Yes, you see it's like this,
my Mother made millions out of oil.

106
00:05:56,969 --> 00:06:00,225
- Ooh, tell me about it
child, tell me about it.

107
00:06:00,225 --> 00:06:01,729
- But she lost most of it.

108
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:04,174
- Tell him about it
child, tell him about it.

109
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:06,000
- But why are you running away?

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,606
- Oh because my Mother wants
me to marry our attorney,

111
00:06:08,606 --> 00:06:10,478
John Blackwell.

112
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:12,062
- You did right Mary,

113
00:06:12,062 --> 00:06:13,608
but where are you running to?

114
00:06:13,608 --> 00:06:14,869
- To my hotel.

115
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:16,256
- Oh your hotel.

116
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:17,597
- Oh, your hotel.

117
00:06:17,597 --> 00:06:20,458
- Yes, The Ritz de la
Riviera at Floralhurst.

118
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,903
Now my plan is to go down
there and operate it myself,

119
00:06:23,903 --> 00:06:26,722
make it a success, and
then I can be independent.

120
00:06:26,722 --> 00:06:28,271
- And you're perfectly right.

121
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:31,009
All you need is a couple of
good men like us to help ya out.

122
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:32,229
- And are we good men.

123
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:35,413
- (laughs) We are now
in the hotel business.

124
00:06:35,413 --> 00:06:36,839
- Gee, that's grand.

125
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:39,808
- Boy, that's what I call exhilarating.

126
00:06:39,808 --> 00:06:41,687
- What?
- Exhilarating.

127
00:06:41,687 --> 00:06:45,114
- Exhilarating, I'll have to look that up.

128
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:47,815
Exhilarating, E.
- Let's be off.

129
00:06:47,815 --> 00:06:50,443
- Wait a minute, you boys
know anything about hotels?

130
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,174
- Ho ho, do we know anything about hotels.

131
00:06:53,174 --> 00:06:57,983
Ha child, there are several hotels
looking for us right this very minute.

132
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,902
- What's the matter, you outta gas?

133
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:17,914
- [Mary] No, this is the hotel.

134
00:07:17,914 --> 00:07:19,786
- (chuckles) Pretty isn't it?

135
00:07:19,786 --> 00:07:22,079
Showplace I call it, showplace.

136
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,319
- John Blackwell certainly was lying.

137
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,922
I think it's a shame the way
he left this hotel run down.

138
00:07:26,922 --> 00:07:29,139
- Yeah, it's rundown all right.

139
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:31,831
- You know, it's supposed
to be early Victorian.

140
00:07:31,831 --> 00:07:33,848
- (snickers) Very early.

141
00:07:33,848 --> 00:07:35,088
- Too early.

142
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,569
- Mother said that all the
big bugs used to live there.

143
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:39,726
- Eh, they're probably still here.

144
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,226
Let's look around.

145
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,246
This place looks like the place
that fella King Tut was buried.

146
00:08:21,246 --> 00:08:25,413
- Buried, looks more like
the place where he was born.

147
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:28,656
Where did you say you got this hotel?

148
00:08:28,656 --> 00:08:30,739
- My Uncle gave it to me.

149
00:08:31,951 --> 00:08:33,538
- Honey, you've been robbed.

150
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:37,684
- (chuckles) Robbed is right.

151
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:41,184
- Aw come on Addington, let's look around.

152
00:08:41,184 --> 00:08:43,582
We might be able to put it over.

153
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:46,665
- It would be easier to push it over.

154
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,953
- Look!

155
00:08:53,222 --> 00:08:54,222
What's that?

156
00:08:57,047 --> 00:08:58,875
- Is it a mummy?

157
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,875
- No it's Father Time's grandfather.

158
00:09:05,491 --> 00:09:07,918
(knocking on counter)
- [Wilbur] Boy, boy.

159
00:09:07,918 --> 00:09:09,262
- [Addington] Come come my good man.

160
00:09:09,262 --> 00:09:13,012
- Wait wait, let's see
who's registered here.

161
00:09:14,315 --> 00:09:18,384
General Grant, Lydia
Pinkham, Buffalo Bill.

162
00:09:18,384 --> 00:09:21,192
- (chuckles) Quite a cast, quite a cast.

163
00:09:21,192 --> 00:09:23,062
- Do you think they're still here?

164
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,786
- They are if they left a call with him.

165
00:09:25,786 --> 00:09:27,619
Ah, the morning paper.

166
00:09:34,326 --> 00:09:38,683
Oh boy, wait til they hear
what Dewey did at Manila Bay.

167
00:09:38,683 --> 00:09:41,493
You'd better waken the old man.
He may be dead.

168
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:43,644
- Boy boy, this is becoming
irksome, come come.

169
00:09:43,644 --> 00:09:45,373
- [Wilbur] Come on lunch.
- [Addington] Hey!

170
00:09:45,373 --> 00:09:48,039
- [Wilbur] Lunch?
- Kansas City all out.

171
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:55,484
Lad, this young lady here
has placed us in full charge

172
00:09:55,484 --> 00:09:57,139
of the Hotel Ritz de River,

173
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:59,705
and we intend to place
it where it belongs.

174
00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:01,620
Now, (clears throat) our first innovation

175
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,525
is to be the inauguration
of the eight hour day.

176
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:08,452
Eight hours in the morning,
and eight hours in the afternoon.

177
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:11,232
- Well, well that don't help me any.

178
00:10:11,232 --> 00:10:12,732
I'm the night man.

179
00:10:34,297 --> 00:10:37,380
(pocket watch thuds)

180
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,645
- Gee I'm scared.

181
00:10:55,645 --> 00:10:58,206
- That's all right little one, I'm here.

182
00:10:58,206 --> 00:10:59,749
Who's our guest.

183
00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:04,221
- Why he ain't no guest,
he's the house detective.

184
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:06,300
- I'm afraid the thing is a
bust, come on, let's sign off.

185
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,234
- Oh boys, we've got
to think of something.

186
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:10,628
- Gee it would be wonderful

187
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,756
if we could do something with this hotel.

188
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:15,849
- Wonderful, it would be miraculous.

189
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:18,266
- It would make a swell fire.

190
00:11:20,582 --> 00:11:22,054
- (fingers snap) wait a minute.

191
00:11:22,054 --> 00:11:24,047
I've just given birth to an idea.

192
00:11:24,047 --> 00:11:25,762
- My how you must have suffered.

193
00:11:25,762 --> 00:11:27,095
- Listen.

194
00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:30,254
Now listen to knowledge.

195
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:32,449
What this hotel needs is publicity.

196
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:34,880
I'll send the story to
all the leading newspapers

197
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,758
saying that society has
adopted the hotel as a fad.

198
00:11:37,758 --> 00:11:40,527
In two weeks time this old
birdcage will be on the map.

199
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:42,860
Now top that one if you can.

200
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:47,931
Now you two just go on back
there, sit down and relax,

201
00:11:47,931 --> 00:11:52,098
and I'll telephone the good
news to the newspapers.

202
00:11:54,473 --> 00:11:57,223
(loveseat thuds)

203
00:11:58,341 --> 00:12:02,694
- (laughs) That's the idea, just relax.

204
00:12:02,694 --> 00:12:06,446
Hello Central, sorry to disturb you.

205
00:12:06,446 --> 00:12:09,468
Connect me with the editor
of The New York Examiner.

206
00:12:09,468 --> 00:12:13,952
A chair son, so that I may
be able to sit and think.

207
00:12:13,952 --> 00:12:17,046
Hello, editor of The New York Examiner?

208
00:12:17,046 --> 00:12:19,484
Ah, this is Ganzy speaking.

209
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:22,984
Ganzy of Ganzy, Ganzy, and Ganzy,

210
00:12:22,984 --> 00:12:26,402
operators of the world's
greatest hotels (chuckles).

211
00:12:26,402 --> 00:12:30,981
We have recently taken over The Hotel
Ritz de la Riviera at Floralhurst,

212
00:12:30,981 --> 00:12:34,110
and we are making it the
mecca of society (chuckles).

213
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:37,239
Yes, why at this very moment,

214
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:41,406
one of world's greatest
painters is busy redecorating.

215
00:12:42,913 --> 00:12:45,792
Eh, we have installed the
safest safe in the world.

216
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:48,839
Yes, yes, so that society may come here,

217
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,406
and feel that their jewels
will be absolutely safe, yes.

218
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:55,531
Eh, why our register already carries

219
00:12:55,531 --> 00:12:58,784
some of the world's most prominent names,

220
00:12:58,784 --> 00:13:00,702
and one man is here with his wife.

221
00:13:00,702 --> 00:13:04,869
(chuckles) Yes, mm hmm, yes,
I know you will, yes, thanks.

222
00:13:05,989 --> 00:13:07,328
Well boy, how's that?

223
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,003
- (chuckles) That's telling them.

224
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:11,163
- [Addington] Boy, I ain't
never fallen down on anything.

225
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:11,996
(chair crashes)

226
00:13:11,996 --> 00:13:15,246
(Wilbur laughs loudly)

227
00:13:18,823 --> 00:13:22,323
- Society's new fad, The Hotel Ritz de la.

228
00:13:23,979 --> 00:13:27,646
Well, the rundaysvoos
of wealth and fashion.

229
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,013
- Rendezvous.

230
00:13:31,013 --> 00:13:32,879
- I don't believe it.

231
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,129
The rundaysvoos, the hotel.

232
00:13:38,035 --> 00:13:40,934
Well, it looks as if Mary
will be getting somewhere

233
00:13:40,934 --> 00:13:42,483
even if she did run away.

234
00:13:42,483 --> 00:13:44,688
- That story is absurd.

235
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:47,791
As your attorney, I can't
sanction this crazy business.

236
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,000
You can't sanction wealth and fashion
flocking to The Ritz?

237
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,903
- Ah nonsense.

238
00:13:51,903 --> 00:13:55,265
Mary has probably fallen into the hands
of some very clever confidence men,

239
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:57,993
and she'll doubtless wind
up, oh losing her hotel.

240
00:13:57,993 --> 00:13:59,912
- Listen, anything that
happens to that hotel

241
00:13:59,912 --> 00:14:01,135
will be an improvement.

242
00:14:01,135 --> 00:14:05,302
- Yes, but what about something
that may happen to Mary?

243
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,417
- (exhales deeply) I
never thought of that.

244
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:12,314
- (snickers) No, well
I haven't thought about

245
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:14,635
anything but Mary.

246
00:14:14,635 --> 00:14:15,936
You know how much I love her.

247
00:14:15,936 --> 00:14:19,113
- Well I oughta, you told me often enough.

248
00:14:19,113 --> 00:14:21,510
What're your plans?

249
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,754
- I'll go there at once,
throw those men out,

250
00:14:23,754 --> 00:14:25,295
and bring Mary home
here where she belongs.

251
00:14:25,295 --> 00:14:27,618
- You're optimistic, you don't know Mary.

252
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:30,752
- Now don't worry, I'll settle this,

253
00:14:30,752 --> 00:14:32,342
that is if you'll back me up.

254
00:14:32,342 --> 00:14:35,639
- Back you up, I'll be right behind you.

255
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,222
In fact I'll go along with you.

256
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:40,508
- Well all right.

257
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:45,660
I'll meet you here at 12.

258
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,993
Can you imagine,

259
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:56,043
I got it all set to marry the girl,
take over the property,

260
00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:59,057
and a couple of half smart guys come along
and mess up my plans.

261
00:14:59,057 --> 00:15:00,437
- You ain't afraid of 'em are ya?

262
00:15:00,437 --> 00:15:02,770
- No, I'm just apprehensive.

263
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:07,760
If they find out about our hideaway
in the hotel basement we're lost.

264
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,059
- Hey, let's go down there
and take 'em for a ride.

265
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:12,441
- Or put 'em on the spot.

266
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:16,747
- Well my motto is give 'em
the pineapple, it never fails.

267
00:15:16,747 --> 00:15:20,904
- All right Mac, you get down
there as quickly as you can,

268
00:15:20,904 --> 00:15:23,214
but don't do any shooting til you see me.

269
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,714
- [Mac] All right.

270
00:15:36,822 --> 00:15:39,309
- This looks like pie for us boys.

271
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:42,520
Now remember, you're gonna
mix with the best people,

272
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,560
so watch your step,

273
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,757
and the first guy that says
ain't, gets a sock in the nose,

274
00:15:48,757 --> 00:15:50,391
but I'm gonna send the Duchess down

275
00:15:50,391 --> 00:15:52,507
to try and wiggle the combination
out of those two birds

276
00:15:52,507 --> 00:15:54,757
that are running the joint.

277
00:15:55,645 --> 00:15:57,439
Now listen Spudoni,

278
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,744
you go on down ahead
and look the joint over.

279
00:15:59,744 --> 00:16:00,767
We'll meet ya there.

280
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,850
- Sure Chief.

281
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:08,607
The Duchess is one of the
cleverest wives I ever had.

282
00:16:08,607 --> 00:16:11,607
(telephone ringing)

283
00:16:15,036 --> 00:16:15,869
- Hello?

284
00:16:17,034 --> 00:16:18,701
Oh how are you Duke?

285
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:21,844
Yes, I was just reading the story.

286
00:16:21,844 --> 00:16:24,011
Rather expected your call.

287
00:16:24,895 --> 00:16:25,978
Sounds great.

288
00:16:27,215 --> 00:16:30,716
Okay, I'll go down first
and meet you there.

289
00:16:30,716 --> 00:16:31,966
Right, goodbye.

290
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:07,238
(bell ringing)

291
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,326
- Were you ringing?

292
00:17:10,326 --> 00:17:13,307
- No, I was tolling, I
thought you were dead.

293
00:17:13,307 --> 00:17:15,952
Take a glass of water to room 16.

294
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,420
- She drink?

295
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,391
- No, the lady wants to make a high dive.

296
00:17:20,391 --> 00:17:24,775
- Say, you know I'm not as
big a fool as I used to be.

297
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:26,539
- Have you been dieting?

298
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:29,914
(Bellboy scoffs)

299
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:32,111
- This is the Hotel Ritz de la Riviera.

300
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:33,984
Yes, just a moment.

301
00:17:33,984 --> 00:17:34,957
Oh Mr. Ganzy.

302
00:17:34,957 --> 00:17:36,055
- Yes Mr. Boswell.

303
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,380
- A gentleman in Cincinnati

304
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,402
wants to know if the fish are biting.

305
00:17:39,402 --> 00:17:41,319
- If they are, they're biting each other.

306
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:44,832
- They're hungry, no,
they're not hungry, yes.

307
00:17:44,832 --> 00:17:45,665
- How are you sleuth?

308
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:46,665
- All right.

309
00:17:50,398 --> 00:17:52,072
That young fellas a human dynamo.

310
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:56,239
- (chuckles) Yes, everything
he has on is charged.

311
00:17:58,752 --> 00:18:01,804
- You know, things ain't so
quiet around here no more.

312
00:18:01,804 --> 00:18:03,166
I may decide to quit.

313
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,970
- In that case, we require
two weeks written notice.

314
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,317
- Well I can't write.

315
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:08,905
- Then that settles that.

316
00:18:08,905 --> 00:18:12,077
Now eh, go upstairs and
count the chambermaids,

317
00:18:12,077 --> 00:18:15,989
and eh, report to me every now and then.

318
00:18:15,989 --> 00:18:18,596
- Every now and then?
- Every now and then.

319
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,890
- Every now and then.

320
00:18:25,046 --> 00:18:26,483
- Thank you.

321
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:28,027
- Look, more telegrams.

322
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:32,666
Gosh, if this keeps up, we'll have
to build an annex to this hotel.

323
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,719
- Gee, it's a long time
since I've seen you.

324
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:37,552
- Yes, almost an hour.

325
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,090
- And you still like me?

326
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,507
- More than ever.

327
00:18:43,574 --> 00:18:45,491
- More than ever, body?

328
00:18:46,384 --> 00:18:48,258
- More than any, body.

329
00:18:48,258 --> 00:18:49,600
- Now let's don't go into that,

330
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,659
here, here, read some telegrams.

331
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:54,849
- Here's one from Harold Van Asterbilt.

332
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:57,370
He wants two rooms and four baths.

333
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:01,537
- (chuckles) The man's a channel swimmer.

334
00:19:03,844 --> 00:19:05,187
Listen to this one.

335
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:07,836
Reserve wedding suite
for myself and friend,

336
00:19:07,836 --> 00:19:09,753
also room for the wife.

337
00:19:11,657 --> 00:19:14,383
- (snickers) That's what
I call breaking them in.

338
00:19:14,383 --> 00:19:17,466
(Addington chuckles)

339
00:19:19,182 --> 00:19:22,515
- Ah, customers, be alert lad, be alert.

340
00:19:24,428 --> 00:19:27,178
(Bellboy scoffs)

341
00:19:29,276 --> 00:19:30,579
Greetings, greetings.

342
00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:31,925
- And salutations.

343
00:19:31,925 --> 00:19:33,714
- How you do gentlemen?

344
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:37,618
Have you the reservation for
the Duchess Bessie Von Essie.

345
00:19:37,618 --> 00:19:39,655
- Why you're the kind
we throw them out for.

346
00:19:39,655 --> 00:19:41,653
- Will you register Bessie?

347
00:19:41,653 --> 00:19:43,653
- Ah, you are a so kind.

348
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,844
How do you spell Bessie?

349
00:19:47,844 --> 00:19:50,281
- [Wilbur] Yeah (clears throat).

350
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:52,190
(Addington laughs)
- I am, I am so sorry, pardon.

351
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,164
You see your American
English, it is so different.

352
00:19:55,164 --> 00:19:57,730
- Yes, so is our Scotch.
(Wilbur laughs)

353
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,092
What eh, what kind of a
room would you like Duchess,

354
00:20:00,092 --> 00:20:01,201
what kind of a room would you like?

355
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:05,031
- I should like a room in
which I can muse and cogitate.

356
00:20:05,031 --> 00:20:06,314
- Suppose I give you one where you can

357
00:20:06,314 --> 00:20:08,613
Sears and Roebuck (chuckles)?

358
00:20:08,613 --> 00:20:11,476
(Addington clears throat)
- You mean to tell me you never cogitate?

359
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,484
- Not while I'm on duty
Madam, not while I'm on duty.

360
00:20:14,484 --> 00:20:16,235
Look that word up will ya?

361
00:20:16,235 --> 00:20:18,568
- Cogitate, I-J-K.

362
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:23,380
- Codge, codge, codge.
- Cogitate.

363
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,416
- Ah, would you like a
room with or without?

364
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,349
- I will leave everything to you.

365
00:20:29,349 --> 00:20:32,723
- (laughs) She's gonna
leave it all to me (laughs).

366
00:20:32,723 --> 00:20:35,047
- He's my partner, you'll
have to give me half.

367
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:38,100
- Son, son, can't you see
that we're in conference?

368
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,300
Return to your cogitating.

369
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,070
- I hate that word, cogitate.

370
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,489
- Is this the wonderful safe
I have read so much about?

371
00:20:46,489 --> 00:20:48,886
- Yes, yes, would you
care to look it over?

372
00:20:48,886 --> 00:20:51,695
- Ah, that would be
very, very interesting.

373
00:20:51,695 --> 00:20:55,195
- Well step this way Madam, step this way.

374
00:20:56,133 --> 00:21:00,300
There you are, it's a 1932
model, seven bearing crankshaft.

375
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:05,506
No tin there, hydraulic brakes,
all wool and a yard wide.

376
00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:08,791
- Is it burglar proof?

377
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,217
- It is so far.

378
00:21:10,217 --> 00:21:11,921
- A very fine safe indeed.

379
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:13,911
I shall probably look into it later.

380
00:21:13,911 --> 00:21:15,911
- Oh you must, you must.

381
00:21:27,013 --> 00:21:28,430
- Right upstairs.

382
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:34,824
(suitcase explodes)

383
00:21:41,624 --> 00:21:43,007
- What's the matter with you?

384
00:21:43,007 --> 00:21:44,515
- What's the matter with that dame?

385
00:21:44,515 --> 00:21:47,042
- Nothing, the lady is simply eccentric.

386
00:21:47,042 --> 00:21:48,459
I'll show her up.

387
00:21:52,206 --> 00:21:54,324
I trust you will forgive
my partner Duchess.

388
00:21:54,324 --> 00:21:58,557
You see, he falls for every
pretty girl he sees (laughs).

389
00:21:58,557 --> 00:22:02,469
- I could not refuse you
anything, you are so fascinating.

390
00:22:02,469 --> 00:22:04,055
- Yes, I suppose so.

391
00:22:04,055 --> 00:22:07,226
You know Duchess, sometimes
I think it's a curse.

392
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:10,522
- Oh by the way, is it customary
to dress for dinner here?

393
00:22:10,522 --> 00:22:13,496
- Oh yes, yes, yes, we
dress for all meals here.

394
00:22:13,496 --> 00:22:15,209
It gets a little drafty around six.

395
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:19,849
(Duchess and Addington laugh loudly)

396
00:22:19,849 --> 00:22:23,511
You know, I think Addington's idea
is gonna turn out all wrong.

397
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:24,844
- Ah.

398
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:27,304
- 10:30 and all is well.

399
00:22:28,152 --> 00:22:29,673
- Did you hear that?

400
00:22:29,673 --> 00:22:32,410
Even the Chief himself
says that all is well.

401
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,131
- Well I don't believe
anything I hear these days.

402
00:22:35,131 --> 00:22:37,881
- Honey, you're gonna believe me.

403
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,939
- Greetings my friend, greetings.

404
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:46,934
- And salutations.

405
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:48,975
- I'd like a suite.
- Certainly, certainly.

406
00:22:48,975 --> 00:22:51,047
Something modern or comfortable?

407
00:22:51,047 --> 00:22:53,039
- Oh, something high up.

408
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,665
- Something high up.

409
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:56,948
- Would $30.00 a day be high enough?

410
00:22:56,948 --> 00:22:58,413
- Quite satisfactory.

411
00:22:58,413 --> 00:23:00,777
May I register?
- Certainly sir, certainly.

412
00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:04,944
Ah, Democrat or Republican (chuckles)?

413
00:23:09,043 --> 00:23:10,978
Ah, Switzerland.

414
00:23:10,978 --> 00:23:12,285
Oh, well you will love it here.

415
00:23:12,285 --> 00:23:15,498
Our radiators yodel all night (laughs).

416
00:23:15,498 --> 00:23:17,662
- I'd like a room with a good exposure.

417
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:20,557
- He wants a room with exposure.

418
00:23:20,557 --> 00:23:22,412
- Are we gonna allow that here?

419
00:23:22,412 --> 00:23:25,841
- Certainly, your stupidity is stupendous.

420
00:23:25,841 --> 00:23:29,570
- Stupendous. - Stupendous.
- Stupendous. - Stupendous.

421
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,403
- S.

422
00:23:30,403 --> 00:23:32,564
- Stoop, stoop, not
that way, not that way.

423
00:23:32,564 --> 00:23:35,010
- S-T double O.
- S-T double O.

424
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,564
- Hey, is that the
famous safe I read about?

425
00:23:38,564 --> 00:23:42,148
- Oh uh, yes, yes, that's our safe.

426
00:23:42,148 --> 00:23:43,854
- Well I gotta a lot of
valuable jewels with me,

427
00:23:43,854 --> 00:23:45,456
and I'd like to look it
over, if it's in order.

428
00:23:45,456 --> 00:23:47,206
- Why certainly sir, it's always in order.

429
00:23:47,206 --> 00:23:49,123
Will you step this way?

430
00:23:55,591 --> 00:23:57,174
Pip ain't it?

431
00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:01,418
- Very sturdy looking safe I should say.

432
00:24:01,418 --> 00:24:03,690
In what eh, compartment
will my valuables be kept?

433
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:06,254
- Here's where we keep all
the valuable jewels sir.

434
00:24:06,254 --> 00:24:08,325
- Very very interesting.

435
00:24:08,325 --> 00:24:10,360
I'll send my jewels down later.

436
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,307
- Good, good, our safe
will always be open to you.

437
00:24:14,307 --> 00:24:15,140
- Thanks.

438
00:24:19,312 --> 00:24:24,115
- Mark my word, there's
gonna be trouble around here.

439
00:24:24,115 --> 00:24:25,433
- Come on boy.

440
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:28,183
(suitcase thuds)

441
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:36,764
Just a few samples from
my Father's factory.

442
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:41,156
He manufactures lawnmowers.

443
00:24:41,156 --> 00:24:43,739
- It's a great mower all right.

444
00:24:44,896 --> 00:24:46,563
- Here boy, come on.

445
00:24:55,813 --> 00:24:57,690
- Do you think that fellas all right?

446
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,867
- Don't give it a thought.

447
00:24:58,867 --> 00:25:01,223
Society people are simply eccentric.

448
00:25:01,223 --> 00:25:02,403
He's a big shot.

449
00:25:02,403 --> 00:25:05,249
(gun firing)

450
00:25:05,249 --> 00:25:06,675
- Bit shot?

451
00:25:06,675 --> 00:25:08,425
He's a whole arsenal.

452
00:25:17,064 --> 00:25:19,814
- Eleven o'clock and all is well.

453
00:25:26,154 --> 00:25:29,537
- Honey, do you remember the other night

454
00:25:29,537 --> 00:25:33,122
in that moonlight night when
we were in the boat, huh?

455
00:25:33,122 --> 00:25:35,611
- Gee do I, and wasn't
it fun out there too?

456
00:25:35,611 --> 00:25:37,592
(Wilbur chuckles)

457
00:25:37,592 --> 00:25:38,684
Mother!

458
00:25:38,684 --> 00:25:43,154
Well, I'm glad you admit it
after trying so hard to run away from me.

459
00:25:43,154 --> 00:25:44,656
Who's this odd looking person?

460
00:25:44,656 --> 00:25:49,827
Well uh,
this is Wilbur Boswell Mother.

461
00:25:49,827 --> 00:25:51,051
- Oh it is, is it?

462
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:52,805
Well I don't like his looks.

463
00:25:52,805 --> 00:25:54,972
Reminds me of your Father.

464
00:25:56,428 --> 00:25:57,696
- I'm pleased to meet ya.

465
00:25:57,696 --> 00:26:00,228
- Yeah, you just think
you're pleased to meet me.

466
00:26:00,228 --> 00:26:02,982
Mary you've made a grave mistake,
and embarrassed your Mother dreadfully.

467
00:26:02,982 --> 00:26:07,454
Oh but Mr. Boswell here and his friend
Mr. Ganzy are wonderful hotel specialists,

468
00:26:07,454 --> 00:26:10,410
and Mother they're going to
make us a fortune. Aren't you?

469
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,455
- Good afternoon folks, good
afternoon, good afternoon.

470
00:26:13,455 --> 00:26:15,550
Are you being taken care of?
- Are you?

471
00:26:18,178 --> 00:26:22,345
- There will now be a slight
pause for station announcement.

472
00:26:23,725 --> 00:26:25,390
- This is my Mother Mr. Ganzy.

473
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,368
- Oh well that's different,
how are you Mother?

474
00:26:27,368 --> 00:26:29,285
How are ya, how are ya?

475
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,453
- [Mary] And Mr. Blackwell.

476
00:26:31,453 --> 00:26:33,574
- Well fidget the digits
old pal, fidget the digits,

477
00:26:33,574 --> 00:26:36,386
you're gonna love us around
here, you're going to love us.

478
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,826
Are you the mother of
that beautiful child?

479
00:26:38,826 --> 00:26:40,243
- Yes I am!

480
00:26:41,385 --> 00:26:44,034
- Well sir, do you know that
I have never seen beauty

481
00:26:44,034 --> 00:26:46,389
so perfectly transplanted.

482
00:26:46,389 --> 00:26:47,806
- Oh, Mr. Pansy.

483
00:26:49,271 --> 00:26:52,332
- Hey, not Pansy, Ganzy, Ganzy.

484
00:26:52,332 --> 00:26:55,665
Look, Ga Ga (chuckles).

485
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,684
Is that your little boy?

486
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:01,046
- No, Mr. Blackwell is my attorney,

487
00:27:01,046 --> 00:27:02,595
and is to be my future son-in-law.

488
00:27:02,595 --> 00:27:03,428
- [Addington] Oh yes.

489
00:27:03,428 --> 00:27:05,574
- I guess Mary will have
something to say about that.

490
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:06,907
- Shut up!

491
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:13,909
You know Mr. Pansy.

492
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:18,058
- Ga Ga.
- You know Mr. Ga Ga,

493
00:27:18,058 --> 00:27:21,194
I must be very careful of my
daughter's social standing.

494
00:27:21,194 --> 00:27:22,027
- Oh yes.

495
00:27:22,027 --> 00:27:24,086
- One must have a social
position nowadays.

496
00:27:24,086 --> 00:27:25,402
- Either that or a job.

497
00:27:25,402 --> 00:27:26,520
(Mrs. Marsh giggles)

498
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,866
You know, I've always thought that Mary

499
00:27:28,866 --> 00:27:30,480
should marry a man of means.

500
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,026
Oh by all means Mrs. Marsh, by all
means, and you should do the same.

501
00:27:34,026 --> 00:27:38,172
- Oh Mr. Pansy, your
frankness frightens me.

502
00:27:38,172 --> 00:27:40,041
(Addington laughs)

503
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:41,143
Are you married?

504
00:27:41,143 --> 00:27:44,726
- No, I got this way
from riding a bicycle.

505
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,358
- I think I'll register.

506
00:27:49,358 --> 00:27:51,578
- You think you'll register?
You little mugwump.

507
00:27:51,578 --> 00:27:54,661
(Mrs. Marsh giggles)

508
00:27:57,089 --> 00:27:59,287
- I want a large room.

509
00:27:59,287 --> 00:28:01,571
- You'll need it.
- What's that?

510
00:28:01,571 --> 00:28:03,610
- I said we got some nice open ones.

511
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:07,654
- Come on Mother, I'll
show you to your room.

512
00:28:07,654 --> 00:28:11,654
- You know, I think you're a
man of charm and intellect.

513
00:28:11,654 --> 00:28:14,727
You'll make a great success of this hotel.

514
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:16,477
If it wasn't for him!

515
00:28:20,226 --> 00:28:21,726
I'll see ya later.

516
00:28:30,395 --> 00:28:32,556
- Have a boy show me my room.
- Ah certainly, certainly.

517
00:28:32,556 --> 00:28:34,754
Your room number will be ah, 28.

518
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,545
- [Wilbur] 28.

519
00:28:36,545 --> 00:28:40,517
Now if you wish anything else,
just wring a towel (laughs).

520
00:28:40,517 --> 00:28:42,309
(Addington clears throat)

521
00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:45,226
- You're both delightfully unfunny.

522
00:28:46,889 --> 00:28:51,056
- You're gonna wipe out our
business with those towel jokes.

523
00:28:52,033 --> 00:28:53,950
- It won't be long now.

524
00:28:55,836 --> 00:28:58,900
Do you really think that Mary
will have to marry that fella?

525
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,164
- I suppose she will, it's customary.

526
00:29:02,164 --> 00:29:05,269
- Gee, but I'm in love with Mary.

527
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:07,472
You've got to do something about it.

528
00:29:07,472 --> 00:29:09,222
- For instance, what?

529
00:29:10,084 --> 00:29:13,182
- If I could think I wouldn't ask you,

530
00:29:13,182 --> 00:29:17,216
but if you're a pal of
mine you'll do something.

531
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:20,716
- I got it, listen, I'll marry Mrs. Marsh,

532
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:24,656
then I will be Mary's father.

533
00:29:24,656 --> 00:29:26,934
When that happens, I'll give my consent

534
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:29,290
to your marriage to my daughter,

535
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,975
which will make you my son.

536
00:29:31,975 --> 00:29:35,471
It's a little involved, but
it'll work out all right.

537
00:29:35,471 --> 00:29:37,994
- Addington, you don't mean to tell me

538
00:29:37,994 --> 00:29:39,618
you'd marry that battleship?

539
00:29:39,618 --> 00:29:43,785
- Certainly, that's a lot of
woman boy, a lot of woman.

540
00:29:49,993 --> 00:29:54,471
Look boy, we're getting
the cream of society.

541
00:29:54,471 --> 00:29:56,101
Good afternoon my good man.

542
00:29:56,101 --> 00:29:58,053
What good can we do for ya?

543
00:29:58,053 --> 00:29:59,925
- Nice weather we're having,

544
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:02,842
that is for a small town like this.

545
00:30:03,829 --> 00:30:05,375
- I am the Duke of Winchester.

546
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:07,396
I would like a very expensive room.

547
00:30:07,396 --> 00:30:08,729
- You'll get it.

548
00:30:09,963 --> 00:30:12,849
- Ah, I see my wife is here.

549
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:13,908
- [Wilbur] Your wife?

550
00:30:13,908 --> 00:30:15,700
- Yes, in 24.

551
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,033
- Oh yes, in 24.

552
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,942
That was six years after the war.

553
00:30:20,942 --> 00:30:23,542
- Is eh--
- Yes, that's our little safe.

554
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:25,660
- A marvelous piece of furniture,

555
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,777
and now if you don't
mind, I'll go to my room.

556
00:30:27,777 --> 00:30:31,944
- [Addington] I don't mind a
bit, you just run right along.

557
00:30:39,217 --> 00:30:40,467
- Look at this.

558
00:30:43,296 --> 00:30:44,679
- Why it couldn't be him.

559
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:47,482
- It couldn't be, but it is.

560
00:30:47,482 --> 00:30:50,659
- Wait a minute, I'll ask him.

561
00:30:50,659 --> 00:30:53,576
I beg your pardon sir, is that you?

562
00:30:57,663 --> 00:31:02,539
(Duke and Addington laugh loudly)

563
00:31:02,539 --> 00:31:05,479
- My oh my, I do wish they
would catch this scoundrel.

564
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:07,525
- Well, you know the police
are not so hot around here.

565
00:31:07,525 --> 00:31:10,608
- No, no, they're very lackadaisical.

566
00:31:14,407 --> 00:31:17,205
(book thuds)
- I'm getting sick of this.

567
00:31:17,205 --> 00:31:19,156
- Lack, lack, lack, lack, L, L, L.

568
00:31:19,156 --> 00:31:20,656
- L-A-C.

569
00:31:23,793 --> 00:31:27,470
- You know, I've been
mistaken for him many times.

570
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,531
It's most annoying.

571
00:31:28,531 --> 00:31:30,726
- Oh yes, I should say it must be.

572
00:31:30,726 --> 00:31:34,185
What right has he got
running around looking like you anyway?

573
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:37,401
- Rather um, peculiar coincidence.

574
00:31:37,401 --> 00:31:39,070
- A what?
- Very peculiar.

575
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,920
- Yeah, it must've been two other fellas.

576
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,690
- Yes, yes, it must've been.

577
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:47,607
- I'll show you up, personally sir.

578
00:31:49,245 --> 00:31:50,412
- I'm honored.

579
00:31:57,672 --> 00:32:00,728
- Mr. Ganzy seems very intelligent,

580
00:32:00,728 --> 00:32:04,282
but if that other person had another
brain, he'd still have just one.

581
00:32:05,538 --> 00:32:08,389
- Oh Mother, I think you're
all wrong about Wilbur.

582
00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:10,181
He has such a sweet personality.

583
00:32:10,181 --> 00:32:12,649
(Mrs. Marsh scoffs)
And he's a man you can trust.

584
00:32:12,649 --> 00:32:15,083
- Nonsense, John
Blackwell's the man for you.

585
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:17,737
He's wealthy, worldly, and wise.

586
00:32:17,737 --> 00:32:20,654
(knocking on door)

587
00:32:25,768 --> 00:32:28,480
- Oh my love, you are here.

588
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,441
- Oui misure, and I like it very much.

589
00:32:30,441 --> 00:32:32,880
- Oh, I am so glad, I am so glad.

590
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,380
Oh I am so sorry, do bring the luggage in.

591
00:32:43,684 --> 00:32:46,138
I think he knows the
combination of the safe.

592
00:32:46,138 --> 00:32:47,237
- What'll we do?

593
00:32:47,237 --> 00:32:49,438
- Dominate him, wear him down.

594
00:32:49,438 --> 00:32:51,355
Take your cues from me.

595
00:32:57,668 --> 00:32:59,668
- Beat it, I'll get him.

596
00:33:10,996 --> 00:33:13,848
- Can I do anything else for you?

597
00:33:13,848 --> 00:33:15,598
- Yes, I am starving.

598
00:33:21,088 --> 00:33:23,572
- Well I'm a little hungry myself.

599
00:33:23,572 --> 00:33:25,989
- But I am starving for love.

600
00:33:27,113 --> 00:33:28,446
- Love?

601
00:33:30,988 --> 00:33:32,321
- Stop!

602
00:33:35,954 --> 00:33:37,135
Come over here.

603
00:33:37,135 --> 00:33:38,360
- No.

604
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,680
- Will you come over here?

605
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,013
- Why certainly.

606
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:48,109
- Now put your arms around me.

607
00:33:49,552 --> 00:33:52,120
Put your arms around me.

608
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,359
Now make love to me.

609
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:56,692
- Ah.
- Make love to me.

610
00:33:58,926 --> 00:34:00,799
- You mean whoopee?

611
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,299
- Make love to me.

612
00:34:07,233 --> 00:34:10,077
I simply will not be mother-in-law
to such a person as Wilbur Boswell.

613
00:34:10,077 --> 00:34:12,396
- I don't care, I love him,
and I'm going to marry him.

614
00:34:12,396 --> 00:34:20,369
(Mrs. Marsh scoffs)
Ooh.

615
00:34:22,972 --> 00:34:26,233
- Well, there's you Romeo making Juliet.

616
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:29,233
- Oh, he, he must sick or something.

617
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,668
(door thuds)

618
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:37,887
- Yeah or something is right.

619
00:34:37,887 --> 00:34:38,887
Get in here.

620
00:34:44,074 --> 00:34:47,706
- Now, I want you to do something.

621
00:34:47,706 --> 00:34:50,434
- Ah now Duchess, wait
a minute, wait a minute.

622
00:34:50,434 --> 00:34:54,601
- Listen, my husband stole
my Mother's wedding ring.

623
00:34:55,476 --> 00:34:57,714
Tonight he will put it in the safe.

624
00:34:57,714 --> 00:35:00,367
I must have that ring back,

625
00:35:00,367 --> 00:35:03,754
and I want you to give me
the combination to the safe.

626
00:35:03,754 --> 00:35:05,300
- But I don't know the combination.

627
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,358
- Don't lie to me.

628
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:10,426
- Honest, my partner's
the only one who knows it.

629
00:35:10,426 --> 00:35:13,682
- Well darling, get it from him.

630
00:35:13,682 --> 00:35:17,849
- Well, I'll try, but he's
the tightest guy I ever saw.

631
00:35:21,016 --> 00:35:22,349
- Wait.

632
00:35:50,603 --> 00:35:52,394
What is the matter?

633
00:35:52,394 --> 00:35:54,388
- Duchess, do me a favor.

634
00:35:54,388 --> 00:35:55,693
- What?

635
00:35:55,693 --> 00:35:58,943
- Please don't tell anybody about this.

636
00:36:00,586 --> 00:36:03,191
- Is there another woman in your life?

637
00:36:03,191 --> 00:36:06,816
- Only Mary, no, you see that is I eh--

638
00:36:06,816 --> 00:36:08,278
- Mary, if I find this Mary,

639
00:36:08,278 --> 00:36:10,191
or any other woman making love to you,

640
00:36:10,191 --> 00:36:11,358
I'll kill her.

641
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,590
- So will I.

642
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:20,529
Mary.

643
00:36:20,529 --> 00:36:24,281
- Don't talk to me, I saw you
in the arms of that woman.

644
00:36:24,281 --> 00:36:26,410
- Oh but Mary I.

645
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,993
Aw gee Mary, honey.

646
00:36:28,932 --> 00:36:31,133
(foot thuds)
Aw not wait a minute Mary.

647
00:36:31,133 --> 00:36:32,682
Honest Mary, will you let me explain.

648
00:36:32,682 --> 00:36:35,099
- Oh will you leave me alone.

649
00:36:36,685 --> 00:36:38,018
- Stop.

650
00:36:40,594 --> 00:36:41,844
Come over here.

651
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,139
- I won't do it.
- Come here!

652
00:36:46,494 --> 00:36:47,911
- You, you brute.

653
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,459
- Come on, over here.

654
00:36:54,327 --> 00:36:56,327
Will you come over here?

655
00:36:57,821 --> 00:36:59,154
Come on!

656
00:37:01,076 --> 00:37:03,826
Put your arms around me, come on!

657
00:37:06,982 --> 00:37:08,649
Now make love to me.

658
00:37:12,953 --> 00:37:17,036
- Oh Wilbur, I do love
you, but I don't trust ya.

659
00:37:18,324 --> 00:37:19,574
- I know honey.

660
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,968
I can explain everything.

661
00:37:22,968 --> 00:37:26,301
It'll take a long time, but I can do it.

662
00:37:28,097 --> 00:37:31,544
- Are you sure that
there's no other woman?

663
00:37:31,544 --> 00:37:33,781
- Positive precious.

664
00:37:33,781 --> 00:37:35,948
- Oh Wilbur, I'm so happy.

665
00:37:37,116 --> 00:37:38,449
- So am I.

666
00:37:39,521 --> 00:37:43,973
- And, and you promise we'll
never have another quarrel?

667
00:37:43,973 --> 00:37:47,172
- I swear--
- Uh uh, knock on wood.

668
00:37:47,172 --> 00:37:49,755
(gun thudding)

669
00:37:51,864 --> 00:37:55,036
- Honey, we'll never have
another argument again

670
00:37:55,036 --> 00:37:56,536
as long as we live

671
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,490
- Well.

672
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,730
- You get outta here.

673
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:10,980
Go on, get out.

674
00:38:12,094 --> 00:38:14,927
Why, how dare you make love to me.

675
00:38:17,307 --> 00:38:20,766
I never saw her before in my life.

676
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:25,244
Positively Duchess, why she's
a perfect stranger to me.

677
00:38:25,244 --> 00:38:27,744
Go on, get out of here, go on.

678
00:38:31,508 --> 00:38:34,425
Duchess, why are woman weak for me?

679
00:38:36,955 --> 00:38:38,872
- Get that combination.

680
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,883
- Yes sir.

681
00:38:56,767 --> 00:39:00,751
- Do you think he'll get
the combination to the safe?

682
00:39:00,751 --> 00:39:02,422
- I doubt it.

683
00:39:02,422 --> 00:39:04,499
- Well than you'll have
to vamp the other fella.

684
00:39:04,499 --> 00:39:07,541
- All right, all right, I will.

685
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:10,187
- Listen, Mr. Boswell, Mr. Ganzy,

686
00:39:10,187 --> 00:39:12,589
that Mr. Blackwell and a gang of crooks

687
00:39:12,589 --> 00:39:14,589
are plotting in room 28.

688
00:39:15,444 --> 00:39:17,469
- There you are Addington,
what did I tell you?

689
00:39:17,469 --> 00:39:18,855
- Tut tut, I'll go upstairs,

690
00:39:18,855 --> 00:39:20,851
and get an earful of what they're saying.

691
00:39:20,851 --> 00:39:22,851
- And I'm going with ya.

692
00:39:26,512 --> 00:39:30,826
Well it's worse than I thought.
The girl is in love with one of them.

693
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,651
Looks like the old lady's
gonna fall for the other one.

694
00:39:32,651 --> 00:39:35,269
- Hmm, then it seems like
our work is cut out for us.

695
00:39:35,269 --> 00:39:36,602
- Yeah.

696
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:50,067
- Come on in here, this room's empty.

697
00:40:00,118 --> 00:40:02,339
- Which is which Chief?

698
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:05,124
- The thin one's Ganzy,
the other one's Boswell.

699
00:40:05,124 --> 00:40:09,291
- Nice boys, just the
type I like (laughs).

700
00:40:10,306 --> 00:40:11,896
- You see, you're all wrong.

701
00:40:11,896 --> 00:40:13,443
They're very fond of us.

702
00:40:13,443 --> 00:40:15,276
- They are?
- Certainly.

703
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,942
- Let's uh, let's put 'em on the spot.

704
00:40:18,942 --> 00:40:23,109
- No, I think we oughta take
'em for a ride (laughs).

705
00:40:23,952 --> 00:40:27,133
- All right, we'll take 'em for a ride.

706
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,716
(all laughing)

707
00:40:31,002 --> 00:40:33,622
- Hey, you know what they're gonna do?
- What?

708
00:40:33,622 --> 00:40:36,673
- Tomorrow they're gonna
take us for a nice long ride.

709
00:40:36,673 --> 00:40:38,339
- They are?
- Yeah.

710
00:40:41,597 --> 00:40:43,514
- I hope it don't rain.

711
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:50,510
- After the ride, I'll give 'em
each a nice juicy pineapple.

712
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,732
(all laughing)

713
00:40:52,732 --> 00:40:54,415
- Hey.
- What?

714
00:40:54,415 --> 00:40:56,081
- Guess what.
- What?

715
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:57,838
- They're gonna give us
each a nice juicy pineapple.

716
00:40:57,838 --> 00:40:59,504
- They are?
- Yeah.

717
00:41:01,663 --> 00:41:04,330
- Oh and I just love pineapples.

718
00:41:06,184 --> 00:41:07,850
- Hey.
- What?

719
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:11,788
I wonder if I can get them to change
mine into a grapefruit, they're juicier.

720
00:41:11,788 --> 00:41:13,892
- You can ask them.
- Well I will.

721
00:41:15,192 --> 00:41:17,645
- Listen.
- What?

722
00:41:17,645 --> 00:41:20,617
- Never put off until tomorrow
what you can do today.

723
00:41:20,617 --> 00:41:22,034
- I got ya.

724
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:24,221
- Which only goes to prove

725
00:41:24,221 --> 00:41:26,621
that you were full of fears,
and foolish fantasies.

726
00:41:26,621 --> 00:41:31,222
- You're right Addington, I
feel so badly about this thing,

727
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,742
I think I'll go in and hide.

728
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:36,825
- Good, you go hide and I'll go seek.

729
00:41:41,483 --> 00:41:42,983
- Go on, go ahead,

730
00:41:45,193 --> 00:41:47,117
and I'll give ya an
extra hundred for the job

731
00:41:47,117 --> 00:41:48,964
if you do it nice and clean.

732
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:52,514
- Don't worry, I used to be a dry cleaner.

733
00:41:52,514 --> 00:41:55,926
(all laughing)

734
00:41:55,926 --> 00:41:56,759
- Hi Bessie.

735
00:41:56,759 --> 00:42:00,342
- Oh ah, could you help
a lady in distress?

736
00:42:01,655 --> 00:42:04,346
- In this dress quicker
than any other dress.

737
00:42:04,346 --> 00:42:06,448
- What eh, what seems
to be the difficulty?

738
00:42:06,448 --> 00:42:08,974
- I can't get the cork out of a bottle.

739
00:42:08,974 --> 00:42:11,374
- Oh well then you have
stopped the right man.

740
00:42:11,374 --> 00:42:12,999
My first job was in the bottling works.

741
00:42:12,999 --> 00:42:14,349
I was a corker (laughs).

742
00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:17,757
- Oh I just knew you were a man of force.

743
00:42:17,757 --> 00:42:20,279
- Not only a man of force,
but a mass of muscle Duchess.

744
00:42:20,279 --> 00:42:21,612
Feel that.

745
00:42:22,757 --> 00:42:25,507
Not so hard Duchess, not so hard.

746
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:38,528
(both laughing)

747
00:42:38,528 --> 00:42:40,028
Well here's to me.

748
00:42:41,695 --> 00:42:44,220
You know this stuff makes you
see double and feel single.

749
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,887
(both laughing)

750
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:49,672
- You know Mr. Ganzy,

751
00:42:49,672 --> 00:42:51,704
you're one of the cleverest men

752
00:42:51,704 --> 00:42:53,070
I have ever met.

753
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,220
- Ha, there's nothing,

754
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,890
I'm one of the cleverest men I ever met.

755
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:58,557
(both laughing)

756
00:43:00,783 --> 00:43:01,616
(Addington exhales deeply)

757
00:43:01,616 --> 00:43:04,505
- A man with a brain like
yours, really should be psychic.

758
00:43:04,505 --> 00:43:07,482
- Psychic, now let's see, who is he?

759
00:43:07,482 --> 00:43:10,898
- Oh a psychic person is
one who is so mentally keen

760
00:43:10,898 --> 00:43:13,098
that they can read another persons mind.

761
00:43:13,098 --> 00:43:14,764
- Is that so?
- Mm hmm, oh yes.

762
00:43:14,764 --> 00:43:15,597
- Oh wow, hmm.

763
00:43:15,597 --> 00:43:18,143
- As a matter of fact,
I'm a bit psychic myself.

764
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,999
- No.

765
00:43:18,999 --> 00:43:21,354
- Mm hmm, would you
like me to demonstrate?

766
00:43:21,354 --> 00:43:24,580
- Certainly, go ahead and psych (laughs).

767
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:27,111
I love demonstrations, go
ahead, psych around awhile.

768
00:43:27,111 --> 00:43:29,182
- All right, you think of something,

769
00:43:29,182 --> 00:43:30,932
and I will read your mind.

770
00:43:30,932 --> 00:43:33,087
- (chuckles) Well that's a
lot of reading Madam Duchess,

771
00:43:33,087 --> 00:43:34,106
a lot of reading Madam.

772
00:43:34,106 --> 00:43:37,994
- (laughs) Be very
careful what you think of.

773
00:43:37,994 --> 00:43:40,193
I may surprise you.

774
00:43:40,193 --> 00:43:41,540
- (laughs) Well in that case,

775
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,416
maybe I better think of something else.

776
00:43:43,416 --> 00:43:44,355
(Duchess laughs loudly)

777
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:46,230
Now let's see, what'll I
think of, what'll I think of?

778
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:48,149
You know I got a lot of
big things on my mind.

779
00:43:48,149 --> 00:43:49,249
What will I think of?

780
00:43:49,249 --> 00:43:50,832
- Oh most anything.

781
00:43:52,014 --> 00:43:54,294
Say the combination of
your wonderful safe.

782
00:43:54,294 --> 00:43:56,737
- The safe, okay, shoot shoot.

783
00:43:56,737 --> 00:44:00,668
The numbers you are thinking
are four, seven, eleven, nineteen.

784
00:44:00,668 --> 00:44:02,176
- (laughs) Well you missed.

785
00:44:02,176 --> 00:44:03,854
That's one on you (laughs).

786
00:44:03,854 --> 00:44:05,828
- Oh, was I very far?

787
00:44:05,828 --> 00:44:08,308
- Very far, why you missed a mile,

788
00:44:08,308 --> 00:44:11,035
your not psyching so
well Duchess (laughs).

789
00:44:11,035 --> 00:44:12,661
- What is the combination?

790
00:44:12,661 --> 00:44:16,078
- The combination to
the safe is 10-20-30-30.

791
00:44:16,078 --> 00:44:18,241
- Oh 10-20-30-30 (laughs).

792
00:44:18,241 --> 00:44:22,408
- Yeah, 10-20-30-30, 60 in all (laughs).

793
00:44:23,565 --> 00:44:26,745
- It certainly is strange, I
must be tired from traveling.

794
00:44:26,745 --> 00:44:28,248
- Yes, I suppose so.

795
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,858
- Perhaps I better take a little nap.

796
00:44:30,858 --> 00:44:35,210
- Did you say nap or nip (laughs)?

797
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:40,056
Well, here's to better
readings and weaker minds.

798
00:44:40,056 --> 00:44:43,591
- And now, if you will excuse me,

799
00:44:43,591 --> 00:44:47,537
I think I will go rest
in the arms of Morpheus.

800
00:44:47,537 --> 00:44:49,371
- Is he registered here?

801
00:44:49,371 --> 00:44:50,392
I'll have to look him up.

802
00:44:50,392 --> 00:44:53,142
(Duchess laughs)

803
00:44:54,457 --> 00:44:57,224
- I'm glad we became so well acquainted

804
00:44:57,224 --> 00:44:59,090
in such a short time.

805
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:00,848
- (chuckles) Well you know Duchess,

806
00:45:00,848 --> 00:45:04,591
I'm eh, I'm kinda easy
to know when you know me.

807
00:45:04,591 --> 00:45:06,424
- You are rather easy.

808
00:45:07,692 --> 00:45:10,545
- Hey listen Duchess,
do me a favor will ya?

809
00:45:10,545 --> 00:45:12,462
Don't read my mind now.

810
00:45:17,629 --> 00:45:19,297
- All is well.

811
00:45:19,297 --> 00:45:23,047
- Hey, keep your eye on
a guy named Morpheus.

812
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:43,472
- Can you beat that for nerve?

813
00:45:43,472 --> 00:45:45,055
McKay and his gang.

814
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:49,514
- That's the most unethical
mob in the racket.

815
00:45:49,514 --> 00:45:52,672
- Yeah, they don't know
what it is to be square.

816
00:45:52,672 --> 00:45:56,829
Why there ain't an honest man among them.

817
00:45:56,829 --> 00:45:58,548
- Well son, how is it now, how is it now?

818
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:00,214
- Fine.
- That's good.

819
00:46:00,214 --> 00:46:02,964
- Here's that nice Mr. Blackwell.

820
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:06,611
- Well well well Mr. Blackwell,

821
00:46:06,611 --> 00:46:09,335
we certainly are delighted
to have you in our midst.

822
00:46:09,335 --> 00:46:10,839
- Hello.

823
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:13,814
- This eh, party you're having tonight.

824
00:46:13,814 --> 00:46:15,034
What time does it start?

825
00:46:15,034 --> 00:46:17,225
Nine o'clock, nine o'clock sharp,
and don't fail to be there.

826
00:46:17,225 --> 00:46:18,935
It'll be something to
tell your children about.

827
00:46:18,935 --> 00:46:22,438
- (laughs) Be sure and be on the spot.

828
00:46:22,438 --> 00:46:24,496
- On the spot?
- Oh now Mr. Blackwell,

829
00:46:24,496 --> 00:46:27,187
of course we know that this
is supposed to be a surprise,

830
00:46:27,187 --> 00:46:29,949
but uh, I can't resist
the temptation to tell you

831
00:46:29,949 --> 00:46:32,273
that we know all about that
delightful little thing

832
00:46:32,273 --> 00:46:34,067
that you're planning for us tomorrow.

833
00:46:34,067 --> 00:46:35,734
(Addington and Wilbur laughing)

834
00:46:35,734 --> 00:46:37,259
- What're ya talking about?

835
00:46:37,259 --> 00:46:40,218
- A little birdie told us (laughs).

836
00:46:40,218 --> 00:46:42,379
- Aw shucks, we know you're gonna take us

837
00:46:42,379 --> 00:46:43,722
for a ride in the morning.

838
00:46:43,722 --> 00:46:47,194
(Addington and Wilbur laughing loudly)

839
00:46:47,194 --> 00:46:49,594
- And don't forget those pineapples.

840
00:46:49,594 --> 00:46:51,507
(Addington and Wilbur laughing loudly)

841
00:46:51,507 --> 00:46:53,708
We love them, don't we (laughs)?

842
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:56,516
- Yeah, he really does (laughs).

843
00:46:56,516 --> 00:46:57,516
Oh boy, yes.

844
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:15,350
(upbeat jazz music)

845
00:47:25,895 --> 00:47:28,669
- Ah, the party is in progress.
- So it is.

846
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:32,867
- Will you eh, split a carnation with me?

847
00:47:32,867 --> 00:47:37,208
- I don't mind.
Thank you.

848
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:49,397
- Look, the 20th Century
is just pulling in.

849
00:47:53,293 --> 00:47:56,988
- Oh, Mr. Stanzy, I've
been turning you over

850
00:47:56,988 --> 00:47:58,840
in my mind all evening.

851
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:02,436
- (laughs) Do tell, well
I'm non plus tiny, non plus.

852
00:48:02,436 --> 00:48:04,453
(Mrs. Marsh giggles)

853
00:48:04,453 --> 00:48:05,978
- Will you excuse me?

854
00:48:05,978 --> 00:48:09,395
- You have no idea how easy that will be.

855
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,466
Too bad he isn't twins, make
a great set of bookends.

856
00:48:15,466 --> 00:48:18,088
(both laughing)

857
00:48:18,088 --> 00:48:20,652
- My you look charming
this evening, charming.

858
00:48:20,652 --> 00:48:23,217
- Oh Mr. Ramsey, I do hope you'll give me

859
00:48:23,217 --> 00:48:25,243
some of your time during the party.

860
00:48:25,243 --> 00:48:28,063
- Darling I shall always
be within a stones throw.

861
00:48:28,063 --> 00:48:31,370
(Mrs. Marsh giggling)

862
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:33,855
- It is a lovely stone isn't it?

863
00:48:33,855 --> 00:48:35,888
- Stone, it's a monument.

864
00:48:35,888 --> 00:48:38,573
(Mrs. Marsh giggling)
Come, let us march and murmur.

865
00:48:38,573 --> 00:48:41,665
- Oh, well you know, I must tell you.

866
00:48:41,665 --> 00:48:43,052
- Yes, yes.

867
00:48:43,052 --> 00:48:45,453
And I said, would you like to
go for a tramp in the woods?

868
00:48:45,453 --> 00:48:46,621
And she was keeping me for a week.

869
00:48:46,621 --> 00:48:50,008
(Mrs. Marsh and Addington laughing)

870
00:48:50,008 --> 00:48:52,349
Oh God, you know I feel like a wild oat

871
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:53,745
going out to be sowed.

872
00:48:53,745 --> 00:48:56,963
(both laughing)

873
00:48:56,963 --> 00:48:58,310
- Are we alone?

874
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,779
- Yeah, you're not scared are you?

875
00:48:59,779 --> 00:49:03,946
- No, no, but I must be
careful of my social status.

876
00:49:05,238 --> 00:49:08,738
- Well sit down and nobody will notice it.

877
00:49:11,141 --> 00:49:13,504
- Tell me, how did you
make your vast fortune?

878
00:49:13,504 --> 00:49:15,090
- Cattle girly, cattle.

879
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:19,349
Down in dear Oklahomey,
down dear old Cimarron Way.

880
00:49:19,349 --> 00:49:21,599
- Ah the great open spaces.

881
00:49:22,741 --> 00:49:24,089
So different from New York.

882
00:49:24,089 --> 00:49:25,683
- Oh New York is all right,

883
00:49:25,683 --> 00:49:27,106
but I like Boston better.

884
00:49:27,106 --> 00:49:29,345
It's more like Grand Rapids.

885
00:49:29,345 --> 00:49:31,508
- Your ranch must be gorgeous.

886
00:49:31,508 --> 00:49:33,176
- Oh it is honey, it is.

887
00:49:33,176 --> 00:49:36,699
Do you know that my ranch is so swell
that we don't have the cattle branded.

888
00:49:36,699 --> 00:49:39,845
- No?
- No, we have 'em engraved.

889
00:49:39,845 --> 00:49:43,588
- Tell me, ah, what motor car do you use?

890
00:49:43,588 --> 00:49:45,680
- Well right now I'm using two.
- No.

891
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,883
- Mm, an Austin and a Ford.
- Ah.

892
00:49:47,883 --> 00:49:50,959
- But I'm putting the big
car up for the winter.

893
00:49:50,959 --> 00:49:54,905
- You know, I suspect you got
a seat on the Stock Exchange.

894
00:49:54,905 --> 00:49:57,894
- Seat, ha, I've got a Morris chair.

895
00:49:57,894 --> 00:50:01,358
I did have a hammock, but I got rid of it.

896
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:05,549
- Tell me, tell me, what
are your views on love?

897
00:50:05,549 --> 00:50:10,310
- I have no views, I just love (panting).

898
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:13,646
- Oh, I just knew you were
that way you little devil.

899
00:50:13,646 --> 00:50:17,813
- (laughs) But tell me
sweetums, are you unmarried?

900
00:50:19,277 --> 00:50:21,127
- Quite often.

901
00:50:21,127 --> 00:50:23,890
You know, I shall never
forget my second husband.

902
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:26,089
- Your second husband?
- Yes, we met by accident.

903
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:26,922
- Hmm.

904
00:50:26,922 --> 00:50:28,573
- He ran over my first
husband with his car.

905
00:50:28,573 --> 00:50:31,219
- Oh, sort of a rundown
condition as it were.

906
00:50:31,219 --> 00:50:34,718
- Yes.
- But what happened to him?

907
00:50:34,718 --> 00:50:37,635
- Oh eh, he died very mysteriously.

908
00:50:39,072 --> 00:50:39,905
- Is that so?

909
00:50:39,905 --> 00:50:43,265
- Yes, you know, I was
put out for over a year.

910
00:50:43,265 --> 00:50:44,931
- Put out?
- Yes.

911
00:50:44,931 --> 00:50:46,483
- You mean you were put in don't ya?

912
00:50:46,483 --> 00:50:48,513
- (chuckles) Ah, but it wasn't long

913
00:50:48,513 --> 00:50:50,470
before I met my third husband.

914
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:52,136
- Your third?
- Yes.

915
00:50:52,136 --> 00:50:54,256
- Oh yes yes, the third (chuckles),

916
00:50:54,256 --> 00:50:57,423
and eh, what happened to number three?

917
00:50:58,896 --> 00:51:01,663
- Oh eh, he was poisoned.

918
00:51:01,663 --> 00:51:04,100
- Poisoned?
- Yes.

919
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,403
- Excuse me, I'll see you later.

920
00:51:05,403 --> 00:51:09,570
- Come, listen, you know, you
remind me of my third husband.

921
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,327
- Oh, I remind you of the third one?

922
00:51:12,327 --> 00:51:16,494
- Yes, you're so keen, you're
so alert, you're so alive.

923
00:51:17,571 --> 00:51:19,852
- Yes, and I'm gonna stay that way.

924
00:51:19,852 --> 00:51:21,393
- Come here, come here.

925
00:51:21,393 --> 00:51:25,343
Oh, I must tell you
about my fifth husband.

926
00:51:25,343 --> 00:51:27,137
- Your fifth husband?
- Yes.

927
00:51:27,137 --> 00:51:29,092
- Now wait a minute honey, wait a minute.

928
00:51:29,092 --> 00:51:31,417
You jumped a husband on me (chuckles).

929
00:51:31,417 --> 00:51:34,438
What happened to number four?

930
00:51:34,438 --> 00:51:37,496
- Oh eh, I don't remember him.

931
00:51:37,496 --> 00:51:41,324
- Oh you don't remember him?
- No no, no he was nondescript.

932
00:51:41,324 --> 00:51:43,597
- Oh I see, one of those foreigners huh?

933
00:51:43,597 --> 00:51:45,268
- Yes.
- Yeah.

934
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:48,237
- Ah, but I shall never
forget my fifth husband.

935
00:51:48,237 --> 00:51:50,004
- Well lay it on honey, lay it on.

936
00:51:50,004 --> 00:51:51,302
What happened to number five?

937
00:51:51,302 --> 00:51:54,598
- Oh, he went to bed
with spinal meningitis.

938
00:51:54,598 --> 00:51:56,918
- Say no more baby, say no more.

939
00:51:56,918 --> 00:51:58,689
You know what I'm gonna do?
- No.

940
00:51:58,689 --> 00:51:59,854
- I'm going out and look
for a good undertaker.

941
00:51:59,854 --> 00:52:02,658
- (chuckles) Ah come back here, come here.

942
00:52:02,658 --> 00:52:04,573
I was only fooling.

943
00:52:04,573 --> 00:52:06,080
I was only putting you to the test.

944
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:09,497
I wanted to find out whether
you were brave and strong.

945
00:52:09,497 --> 00:52:11,614
- Then you're not old
lady Bluebeard herself?

946
00:52:11,614 --> 00:52:13,238
- No.

947
00:52:13,238 --> 00:52:16,331
- You haven't had all those husbands?
- Certainly not.

948
00:52:16,331 --> 00:52:18,239
- Oh well then I can speak freely.

949
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:21,710
Honey, you appeal to me.
As a matter of fact, you madden me.

950
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:24,550
(Mrs. Marsh sighs)
You're the biggest thing in my life.

951
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:25,617
(Mrs. Marsh sighs)

952
00:52:25,617 --> 00:52:28,831
Will you marry me and
be my widow, ah wife?

953
00:52:28,831 --> 00:52:30,912
- Addington!
- Rebecca.

954
00:52:30,912 --> 00:52:34,505
(Mrs. Marsh sighs)

955
00:52:34,505 --> 00:52:38,005
(Addington clicks tongue)

956
00:52:39,169 --> 00:52:41,419
10 o'clock and all is well.

957
00:52:47,446 --> 00:52:52,749
- Well Ganzy and Boswell
are confidence men. Crooks.

958
00:52:52,749 --> 00:52:53,806
- They are not.

959
00:52:53,806 --> 00:52:56,331
Whatever Wilbur Boswell
is, he's not a crook.

960
00:52:56,331 --> 00:52:58,533
- Well perhaps not,

961
00:52:58,533 --> 00:53:01,253
but I don't think
they'll be here tomorrow.

962
00:53:01,253 --> 00:53:03,566
- Why do you say that?

963
00:53:03,566 --> 00:53:06,867
- My information comes from
a very reliable source.

964
00:53:06,867 --> 00:53:09,117
- I still don't believe it.

965
00:53:10,084 --> 00:53:13,256
- Supposing they do disappear tomorrow?

966
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:14,756
Will you marry me?

967
00:53:15,921 --> 00:53:18,403
- Well well well well folks,
I certainly am glad to see you

968
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:20,482
entering into the spirit of the occasion.

969
00:53:20,482 --> 00:53:23,011
- Shh, come on John, let's have a dance.

970
00:53:23,011 --> 00:53:25,982
Addington has something
to talk over with Mary.

971
00:53:25,982 --> 00:53:27,203
- Addington?

972
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:29,886
- Yes Addington, come on.

973
00:53:29,886 --> 00:53:32,769
- So long Mother, see ya around.

974
00:53:32,769 --> 00:53:35,258
- What in the world are you
and Mother talking about?

975
00:53:35,258 --> 00:53:38,102
Your Mother and I have just
been laying a few domestic plans.

976
00:53:38,102 --> 00:53:41,519
You see uh, we decided to
get married and end it all.

977
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:42,352
- Married?

978
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:45,306
- Yeah, so you may now
consider me your Papa.

979
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:46,639
Come child, sit.

980
00:53:49,897 --> 00:53:52,461
- But I'm not sure I want you for a papa.

981
00:53:52,461 --> 00:53:54,536
- What, why I'll make
the finest little father

982
00:53:54,536 --> 00:53:56,696
that you ever had in your life,

983
00:53:56,696 --> 00:53:58,447
and if you're a good little girl,

984
00:53:58,447 --> 00:54:01,051
I may allow you to marry Wilbur.

985
00:54:01,051 --> 00:54:03,205
- But I don't wanna marry Wilbur now.

986
00:54:03,205 --> 00:54:04,996
- Why daughter, why?

987
00:54:04,996 --> 00:54:07,715
- Well because he has a complex.

988
00:54:07,715 --> 00:54:10,985
- That's all right, I'll make
him trade it for a sedan.

989
00:54:10,985 --> 00:54:15,214
- No no, I mean he has another sweetheart.

990
00:54:15,214 --> 00:54:17,782
- He has, why the scoundrel.

991
00:54:17,782 --> 00:54:21,158
I'll teach him to trifle
with my little gal.

992
00:54:21,158 --> 00:54:23,075
- Hey, what's the idea?

993
00:54:24,582 --> 00:54:26,170
- I'm fixing it for ya.

994
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:30,285
- Fixing it, you're chiseling,
that's what you're doing.

995
00:54:30,285 --> 00:54:33,952
- Don't pay any attention
to that man Daddy.

996
00:54:38,836 --> 00:54:41,586
- What is this thing called love?

997
00:54:43,428 --> 00:54:47,214
- I hope you do marry her
Mother and she falls on ya.

998
00:54:47,214 --> 00:54:50,103
I'm going out to do something desperate.

999
00:54:50,103 --> 00:54:53,113
- Daddy, what makes him so wicked?

1000
00:54:53,113 --> 00:54:56,280
- He isn't wicked daughter, he's weak.

1001
00:54:57,666 --> 00:54:59,985
- Do you think he loves
me more than the Duchess?

1002
00:54:59,985 --> 00:55:02,384
- Oh, well honey, he wouldn't trade you

1003
00:55:02,384 --> 00:55:05,074
for all the Dutches in Holland.

1004
00:55:05,074 --> 00:55:06,942
- What do you think I should do?

1005
00:55:06,942 --> 00:55:09,343
- Well, now that I've given my consent,

1006
00:55:09,343 --> 00:55:13,818
I think you oughta look him up, and
tell him that everything is hotsy totsy.

1007
00:55:13,818 --> 00:55:17,078
- Gee but you're gonna make a grand Daddy.

1008
00:55:17,078 --> 00:55:18,328
- A granddaddy?

1009
00:55:35,435 --> 00:55:37,435
- 10:30 and all is well.

1010
00:55:40,556 --> 00:55:44,723
- If all's well now, I'd hate
to see anything go wrong.

1011
00:55:46,006 --> 00:55:47,713
- What's ailing you?

1012
00:55:47,713 --> 00:55:50,213
- I think I'll commit suicide.

1013
00:55:52,022 --> 00:55:56,189
- Say, that's the best idea
you had since you came here.

1014
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,010
Here, try that.

1015
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:11,396
- Do you suppose I could hit my brain?

1016
00:56:11,396 --> 00:56:15,563
- Well you'll, you'll have
to be an awful good shot.

1017
00:56:18,722 --> 00:56:20,836
- Oh Wilbur, please forgive me.

1018
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:23,528
Daddy told me the truth
about that Duchess.

1019
00:56:23,528 --> 00:56:25,236
- You're just in time honey.

1020
00:56:25,236 --> 00:56:27,234
I was gonna kill myself.

1021
00:56:27,234 --> 00:56:29,317
I can't live without you.

1022
00:56:33,376 --> 00:56:37,543
- And, and I can't live
without you either Wilbur.

1023
00:56:43,878 --> 00:56:47,497
- Honey, let's not go on the patio.

1024
00:56:47,497 --> 00:56:49,580
Sit up here for a minute.

1025
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,797
I wanna talk to you about our future.

1026
00:56:53,797 --> 00:56:56,130
(gun thuds)

1027
00:56:57,867 --> 00:57:01,117
Honey, we're gonna put this hotel over,

1028
00:57:02,338 --> 00:57:04,862
then we'll be married.

1029
00:57:04,862 --> 00:57:09,029
We're gonna have a yacht,
a summer and a winter home,

1030
00:57:10,013 --> 00:57:11,930
two automobiles and eh.

1031
00:57:13,886 --> 00:57:15,219
- Yeah.

1032
00:57:15,678 --> 00:57:16,928
- A motorcycle,

1033
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,093
and maybe.

1034
00:57:31,275 --> 00:57:35,257
(cash register rings)

1035
00:57:35,257 --> 00:57:38,424
(cash register rings)

1036
00:57:41,478 --> 00:57:44,206
(cash register rings)

1037
00:57:44,206 --> 00:57:47,981
(cash register rings)

1038
00:57:47,981 --> 00:57:50,100
(cash register rings)

1039
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,267
(cash register rings)

1040
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:59,626
I'll split the difference with ya.

1041
00:57:59,626 --> 00:58:01,008
- Okay.

1042
00:58:01,008 --> 00:58:04,175
(cash register rings)

1043
00:58:06,502 --> 00:58:09,502
(upbeat jazz music)

1044
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:30,988
(thunder crashing)

1045
00:58:36,691 --> 00:58:38,751
- Was that somebody knocking?

1046
00:58:38,751 --> 00:58:40,668
- Oh I'm so frightened.

1047
00:58:44,158 --> 00:58:45,741
- There must be a storm.

1048
00:58:45,741 --> 00:58:48,658
(thunder rumbling)

1049
00:58:52,961 --> 00:58:54,140
The lights are out.

1050
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,908
- [Mary] Gee I'm scared, let's
find Mother and Addington.

1051
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,781
- [Wilbur] Come on honey.

1052
00:58:58,781 --> 00:59:01,698
(thunder crashing)

1053
00:59:06,789 --> 00:59:08,012
- Ooh.

1054
00:59:08,012 --> 00:59:11,031
- My girl, this reminds me of
down in dear old Oklahomey.

1055
00:59:11,031 --> 00:59:14,414
Come on, let's get out of here.

1056
00:59:14,414 --> 00:59:18,581
(guest chattering)
(thunder rumbling)

1057
00:59:21,898 --> 00:59:24,389
- Hey, we better call this thing off,

1058
00:59:24,389 --> 00:59:26,126
or turn it into a swimming party.

1059
00:59:26,126 --> 00:59:28,083
- Quite right Wilbur, quite right.

1060
00:59:28,083 --> 00:59:31,499
Ah folks, on account of this
slight weather disturbance,

1061
00:59:31,499 --> 00:59:34,227
I think we better call the
party off until tomorrow night.

1062
00:59:34,227 --> 00:59:35,448
- Oh.

1063
00:59:35,448 --> 00:59:37,887
(guests chattering)

1064
00:59:37,887 --> 00:59:41,019
- I would like to place
my jewels into the safe.

1065
00:59:41,019 --> 00:59:44,194
- Rare judgement Duchess, rare judgement.

1066
00:59:44,194 --> 00:59:45,821
- I'll do the same.

1067
00:59:45,821 --> 00:59:48,262
- An excellent idea.

1068
00:59:48,262 --> 00:59:50,461
- I'm not sure about this safe business.

1069
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:52,700
- You're never sure about anything.

1070
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:55,869
Follow me folks and
I'll open the safe you.

1071
00:59:55,869 --> 01:00:00,780
(guests chattering)
(thunder rumbling)

1072
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:04,167
Boy, go upstairs, and light some
of those oil lamps right away.

1073
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:05,796
Wilbur, you open the safe.

1074
01:00:05,796 --> 01:00:07,179
I'll collect the jewels.

1075
01:00:07,179 --> 01:00:08,770
We have a little envelope for ya folks.

1076
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:11,061
All you have to do is place them in there
and tear off the receipt.

1077
01:00:11,061 --> 01:00:13,561
Very latest safety precaution.

1078
01:00:14,946 --> 01:00:17,234
- They're putting them in a box for us.

1079
01:00:17,234 --> 01:00:21,638
- Come on, let's get
into our working clothes.

1080
01:00:21,638 --> 01:00:25,351
(guest chattering)

1081
01:00:25,351 --> 01:00:28,580
- [Addington] Tear off you own receipts.
- [Wilbur] Take an envelope.

1082
01:00:30,846 --> 01:00:32,513
- Payday boys.

1083
01:00:33,095 --> 01:00:37,326
Come on, let's get going,
and beat that Duke and his gang to it.

1084
01:00:38,482 --> 01:00:40,357
- [Man] There you are.
- Good night folks, good night.

1085
01:00:40,357 --> 01:00:41,940
- [Man] Good night.

1086
01:00:42,838 --> 01:00:44,267
- Now you have them
sealed tightly have ya?

1087
01:00:44,267 --> 01:00:47,132
That's fine, now you can
go sleep and rest easy.

1088
01:00:47,132 --> 01:00:49,048
- [Gentleman] Good night.
- Good night.

1089
01:00:50,354 --> 01:00:54,016
Oh you want us to keep
that for ya, certainly.

1090
01:00:54,016 --> 01:00:56,683
Good night old boy, sleep tight.

1091
01:01:06,949 --> 01:01:08,249
Hey Sherlock.

1092
01:01:08,249 --> 01:01:09,416
- All is well.

1093
01:01:11,753 --> 01:01:13,420
- Yes, and we wanna keep it that way.

1094
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,420
- Come here.

1095
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:20,130
You see this safe?

1096
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:23,625
Well it's crammed full of valuable jewels.

1097
01:01:23,625 --> 01:01:24,958
- Is it?

1098
01:01:26,188 --> 01:01:28,098
- Is it, I'm telling ya,

1099
01:01:28,098 --> 01:01:30,862
and it's your duty to keep
you eye on it all night.

1100
01:01:30,862 --> 01:01:33,362
Don't take your eye off of it.

1101
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:38,407
- Okay Chief, leave it to me.

1102
01:01:50,681 --> 01:01:52,333
- [Mac] Don't make any mistakes.

1103
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:53,750
- [Henchman] Right.

1104
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:56,044
- Two of us will go
down the back stairway.

1105
01:01:56,044 --> 01:01:57,962
Spike, you keep us covered

1106
01:01:57,962 --> 01:02:00,795
from the other end of the balcony.

1107
01:02:01,948 --> 01:02:05,655
- Now listen boys, we've got to work fast.

1108
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:07,855
Help yourself to the stuff in the safe,

1109
01:02:07,855 --> 01:02:11,513
but the main thing is
Ganzy and Boswell, get 'em.

1110
01:02:11,513 --> 01:02:14,034
- That's Izzy's job,
he'll take care of 'em.

1111
01:02:14,034 --> 01:02:16,720
- All right, I'm gonna
stick around on the balcony,

1112
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:20,303
and if anybody busts
in, I'm gonna pop 'em.

1113
01:02:21,147 --> 01:02:24,064
(thunder crashing)

1114
01:02:37,398 --> 01:02:40,898
- I think I'm right when I say your wrong.

1115
01:02:42,847 --> 01:02:44,180
- Why?

1116
01:02:45,784 --> 01:02:47,034
- I hear noise.

1117
01:02:47,943 --> 01:02:49,276
- That's static.

1118
01:02:50,221 --> 01:02:53,518
- It's burglars, lots of them.

1119
01:02:53,518 --> 01:02:54,980
- Will you go back to sleep.

1120
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:58,647
We've gotta get up early
tomorrow afternoon.

1121
01:03:03,531 --> 01:03:05,844
- I'm going downstairs
and get those jewels

1122
01:03:05,844 --> 01:03:07,180
and put them under my pillow.

1123
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:08,735
- All right, go ahead,

1124
01:03:08,735 --> 01:03:11,956
but I remain right here in
this nice comfortable bed.

1125
01:03:11,956 --> 01:03:13,586
- Well I'm going down.

1126
01:03:13,586 --> 01:03:16,961
(thunder crashing)

1127
01:03:16,961 --> 01:03:18,913
- And I'm going with you.

1128
01:03:18,913 --> 01:03:21,830
(thunder crashing)

1129
01:03:28,309 --> 01:03:30,747
What are you putting that hat on for?

1130
01:03:30,747 --> 01:03:32,699
- I might catch cold in my head.

1131
01:03:32,699 --> 01:03:35,282
- Well that would be something.

1132
01:03:44,157 --> 01:03:47,074
(thunder crashing)

1133
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:36,070
(vase crashing)

1134
01:04:42,431 --> 01:04:46,598
- Careful son, careful, I
think you damaged that vase.

1135
01:04:47,451 --> 01:04:49,847
- It's vahs Addington, vahs.

1136
01:04:49,847 --> 01:04:51,236
I looked it up this morning.

1137
01:04:51,236 --> 01:04:54,403
- Well, have it your own way, come on.

1138
01:05:04,995 --> 01:05:06,828
- Stick your hands up.

1139
01:05:07,924 --> 01:05:09,591
- Gee you scared me.

1140
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,027
For a minute I thought it was a burglar.

1141
01:05:12,027 --> 01:05:14,655
- Keep those hands up.
- Me too?

1142
01:05:14,655 --> 01:05:15,988
- Yeah, you too.

1143
01:05:17,154 --> 01:05:18,751
- What's the big idea?

1144
01:05:18,751 --> 01:05:21,887
If you're lucky, you'll read about
it in the paper in the morning.

1145
01:05:21,887 --> 01:05:24,902
- We don't take the
paper, do we Addington?

1146
01:05:24,902 --> 01:05:26,235
- [Mac] Shut up.

1147
01:05:27,269 --> 01:05:29,769
(guns firing)

1148
01:05:51,107 --> 01:05:54,286
- You know, I don't think it's safe here.

1149
01:05:54,286 --> 01:05:56,786
(guns firing)

1150
01:06:04,138 --> 01:06:06,305
- See if he's got a cigar.

1151
01:06:15,774 --> 01:06:18,191
(gun firing)

1152
01:06:21,837 --> 01:06:23,586
I'm smoking too much anyway.

1153
01:06:23,586 --> 01:06:26,169
Come on, let's get out of here.

1154
01:06:36,078 --> 01:06:39,292
(balloon pops)

1155
01:06:39,292 --> 01:06:42,077
I think they got me.
- Where?

1156
01:06:45,928 --> 01:06:49,428
Now you'll have to travel on your stomach.

1157
01:06:50,702 --> 01:06:53,027
(balloon pops)

1158
01:06:53,027 --> 01:06:54,861
They almost got me that time.

1159
01:06:54,861 --> 01:06:56,698
They must be firing from the basement.

1160
01:06:56,698 --> 01:06:58,031
- Yeah.

1161
01:06:59,951 --> 01:07:03,172
(balloon pops)

1162
01:07:03,172 --> 01:07:04,394
- They're getting closer.

1163
01:07:04,394 --> 01:07:06,481
- Closer, they're right on our heels.

1164
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:08,711
(balloons popping)
- You rats.

1165
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:12,080
(guns firing)

1166
01:07:21,617 --> 01:07:23,283
- Hey.
- [Wilbur] What?

1167
01:07:23,283 --> 01:07:25,533
- I got a great idea, look.

1168
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:29,333
(guns firing)

1169
01:07:33,996 --> 01:07:37,985
- Say, that was great,
where'd you learn that?

1170
01:07:37,985 --> 01:07:39,985
- I came from Davenport.

1171
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:43,356
- Hey.
- What?

1172
01:07:43,356 --> 01:07:45,817
- Get up and reconnoiter.
- I don't have to.

1173
01:07:46,679 --> 01:07:50,012
- Reconnoiter, look around, look around.

1174
01:08:02,188 --> 01:08:04,688
(guns firing)

1175
01:08:28,755 --> 01:08:31,809
- (chuckles) Boy, that's some fly swatter.

1176
01:08:31,809 --> 01:08:34,005
- You know I'm glad I stopped that.

1177
01:08:34,005 --> 01:08:36,567
That is liable to waken
some of our guests.

1178
01:08:36,567 --> 01:08:39,900
- That's right.
(guns firing)

1179
01:08:52,436 --> 01:08:53,769
Come on.

1180
01:08:56,874 --> 01:08:59,366
- Well, did you get Ganzy and Boswell.
- Get them no.

1181
01:08:59,366 --> 01:09:01,724
Say, they're two of the
toughest guys I ever seen.

1182
01:09:01,724 --> 01:09:03,390
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

1183
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:05,016
I mean they're down in the
lobby with a machine gun.

1184
01:09:05,016 --> 01:09:07,580
Bumping them off faster than
they did in no mans land.

1185
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:09,629
Now listen Izzy,
I'm not gonna lose the stuff or the girl

1186
01:09:09,629 --> 01:09:11,588
on account of those two numbskulls.

1187
01:09:11,588 --> 01:09:14,506
Now you go downstairs and don't come back
until you've nailed them both.

1188
01:09:14,506 --> 01:09:18,815
- Not me Blackie, I'm leaving.
- You swine.

1189
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:26,066
I'll go down and get 'em myself.

1190
01:09:26,943 --> 01:09:28,735
(door thuds)

1191
01:09:28,735 --> 01:09:30,401
- Mother!
- What?

1192
01:09:30,401 --> 01:09:32,384
John Blackwell is going
downstairs to kill Wilbur.

1193
01:09:32,384 --> 01:09:35,476
- Good.
- And Addington.

1194
01:09:35,476 --> 01:09:37,550
- Not my Addington.
- Yes, I heard him say so.

1195
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:39,098
I'm going and tell Wilbur.

1196
01:09:39,098 --> 01:09:41,067
- Well nobody's gonna kill my Addington

1197
01:09:41,067 --> 01:09:42,937
without my telling him about it.

1198
01:09:42,937 --> 01:09:44,270
Oh dear.

1199
01:09:47,421 --> 01:09:50,004
(bed crashing)

1200
01:09:53,548 --> 01:09:56,465
(thunder rumbling)

1201
01:10:06,921 --> 01:10:09,405
- How are we gonna get over to that safe?

1202
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:10,587
- We'll take the bus.

1203
01:10:10,587 --> 01:10:13,087
(guns firing)

1204
01:10:21,948 --> 01:10:24,371
- I wonder where Wilbur is?

1205
01:10:24,371 --> 01:10:25,510
(Mary whistles)

1206
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:27,673
(gun firing)

1207
01:10:27,673 --> 01:10:29,168
Oh.

1208
01:10:29,168 --> 01:10:30,584
- This is no time to whistle.

1209
01:10:30,584 --> 01:10:32,662
- I know, but I have to save Wilbur.

1210
01:10:32,662 --> 01:10:36,293
Yes I know, but you've got to stop
inviting bullets in this direction.

1211
01:10:36,293 --> 01:10:38,710
I'm too easy to hit, come on.

1212
01:10:45,016 --> 01:10:46,349
Ouch!

1213
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,986
(chair crashes)

1214
01:11:07,986 --> 01:11:11,451
(guns firing)
(Mrs. Marsh screams)

1215
01:11:11,451 --> 01:11:12,632
- Come on, get on.

1216
01:11:12,632 --> 01:11:15,357
- Hey, where am I gonna ride?

1217
01:11:15,357 --> 01:11:17,626
- Take the lower berth.
- [Wilbur] Okay.

1218
01:11:18,532 --> 01:11:20,732
- You set?
- Wait a minute, can you run this thing?

1219
01:11:20,732 --> 01:11:23,138
- Certainly, it's a standard ship.
- Go, go.

1220
01:11:23,138 --> 01:11:25,638
(guns firing)

1221
01:11:37,863 --> 01:11:39,243
- Good man.

1222
01:11:39,243 --> 01:11:42,493
- Yeah, he's watching things all right.

1223
01:11:44,415 --> 01:11:47,792
- You light a match, I'll
work the combination.

1224
01:11:47,792 --> 01:11:50,074
- Hey, I've only got one match.

1225
01:11:50,074 --> 01:11:52,476
- That's not enough.

1226
01:11:52,476 --> 01:11:53,643
Hey, light it.

1227
01:11:59,727 --> 01:12:03,560
Now hold it close, put
it right under my nose.

1228
01:12:05,234 --> 01:12:07,188
What's to be so nervous about?

1229
01:12:07,188 --> 01:12:09,350
Give me that candle.

1230
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:11,139
(Wilbur barks)

1231
01:12:11,139 --> 01:12:14,389
Careful, you wanna mess up the floor?

1232
01:12:15,938 --> 01:12:19,040
- What's the matter?
- I've forgotten the combination.

1233
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,078
- It's 10-20-30-30.

1234
01:12:21,078 --> 01:12:22,744
- You open it.
- Here, I'll do it.

1235
01:12:22,744 --> 01:12:24,827
Here, 10, hold it closer.

1236
01:12:27,773 --> 01:12:30,606
Will you get it, here, give me it.

1237
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:34,516
Do you wanna make yourself sick
at your stomach? Give me that.

1238
01:12:38,528 --> 01:12:39,861
Why you crazy.

1239
01:12:41,413 --> 01:12:44,681
Give me that you dummy.
You wanna blow the joint up?

1240
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:47,798
(gun firing)

1241
01:12:47,798 --> 01:12:50,798
(dynamite explodes)

1242
01:12:55,203 --> 01:12:58,286
Somebody must've turned the gas on.

1243
01:13:01,481 --> 01:13:03,357
Oh Wilbur, are you hurt?

1244
01:13:03,357 --> 01:13:04,981
I never felt better in my life.

1245
01:13:04,981 --> 01:13:06,654
Addington, are the jewels safe?

1246
01:13:06,654 --> 01:13:08,769
Certainly they're safe,
haven't I been guarding 'em?

1247
01:13:08,769 --> 01:13:10,318
Ah.

1248
01:13:10,318 --> 01:13:12,568
Ah, the electricity's on.

1249
01:13:16,217 --> 01:13:18,985
Looks like they wiped
out a whole crime wave.

1250
01:13:18,985 --> 01:13:20,402
Pick 'em up boys.

1251
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:23,582
I'll have to congratulate you fellas.

1252
01:13:23,582 --> 01:13:25,823
The award on these crooks
will amount to a fortune.

1253
01:13:25,823 --> 01:13:26,656
Reward?

1254
01:13:26,656 --> 01:13:30,489
Yep, they've all got
a price on their heads.

1255
01:13:36,291 --> 01:13:39,546
I caught this here lady
running away with this here box.

1256
01:13:39,546 --> 01:13:42,045
- The jewels.
- Jewels. - The jewels.

1257
01:13:42,045 --> 01:13:45,572
Why Duchess, would you double cross
your old psychic sidekick?

1258
01:13:45,572 --> 01:13:48,246
Jewels (snickers)?

1259
01:13:48,246 --> 01:13:50,987
It's the detectives lunch.

1260
01:13:50,987 --> 01:13:52,320
Get.

1261
01:13:52,658 --> 01:13:56,027
Here's another one Sheriff. Just found him
under the sofa, and he was still kicking.

1262
01:13:56,027 --> 01:13:59,690
If I'm not mistaken, you're
Buffalo Blackie, the smuggler,

1263
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:03,114
and you've been using the basement
of this hotel for a storehouse.

1264
01:14:03,114 --> 01:14:05,317
Basement, I didn't know we had one.

1265
01:14:05,317 --> 01:14:06,650
Come on.

1266
01:14:07,716 --> 01:14:08,966
Well I sworn.

1267
01:14:13,688 --> 01:14:16,003
Can I have Mary now?

1268
01:14:16,003 --> 01:14:19,631
Tell me Papa, shall we give
our little daughter away?

1269
01:14:19,631 --> 01:14:22,548
Certainly, we'll get another one.

1270
01:14:27,609 --> 01:14:30,026
12 o'clock and all is well.

1271
01:14:31,109 --> 01:14:34,192
(upbeat jazz music)
