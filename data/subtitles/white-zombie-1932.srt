1
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:17,730
Looks like a burial.

2
00:02:18,231 --> 00:02:19,331
In the road?

3
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:27,053
Driver, what is it?

4
00:02:27,972 --> 00:02:29,821
It’s a funeral, Mademoiselle.

5
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,427
They are afraid of the men
who steal dead bodies.

6
00:02:34,327 --> 00:02:37,242
So they dig the grave in
the middle of the road

7
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,309
where people pass all the time.

8
00:02:50,658 --> 00:02:54,823
Well, that’s a cheerful introduction
for you to our West Indies.

9
00:03:30,142 --> 00:03:33,397
Do you know where is the house
of monsieur Beaumont?

10
00:03:57,693 --> 00:04:00,689
Zombies!  Aller vite! Allez!

11
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:10,136
It felt like hands touching me.

12
00:05:01,274 --> 00:05:02,635
Driver, why did you drive
like that you fool?

13
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,736
We might have been killed!

14
00:05:03,835 --> 00:05:05,523
Worse than that, Monsieur,

15
00:05:06,124 --> 00:05:07,824
we might have been caught.

16
00:05:08,043 --> 00:05:09,489
Caught? By whom?

17
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:10,657
Those men you spoke to?

18
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:13,251
They are not men Monsieur

19
00:05:14,035 --> 00:05:15,652
they are dead bodies.

20
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:17,146
Dead?

21
00:05:17,147 --> 00:05:18,247
Yes, Monsieur

22
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,836
Zombies.

23
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,637
The living dead.

24
00:05:23,832 --> 00:05:25,972
Corpses taken from their graves

25
00:05:26,372 --> 00:05:29,155
who are made to work in sugar mills

26
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:31,056
and fields at night.

27
00:05:35,614 --> 00:05:36,443
Look!

28
00:05:37,044 --> 00:05:38,044
Here they come!

29
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:49,733
Look, look!

30
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,352
Excuse me please,

31
00:06:03,653 --> 00:06:04,953
have you got a match?

32
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:08,338
Did I frighten you?

33
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:10,439
I’m sorry.

34
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,740
I’m oddly enough I suppose.

35
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,352
No, it wasn’t you.

36
00:06:13,552 --> 00:06:15,512
Something happened back
on the road there.

37
00:06:15,712 --> 00:06:18,179
We stopped to speak to some men.

38
00:06:19,216 --> 00:06:21,478
Our driver told us that they
weren’t men at all.

39
00:06:21,578 --> 00:06:23,247
He said they were corpses.

40
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,464
Corpses.

41
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:29,823
Surely you don’t believe it do you?

42
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:33,720
No. But I don’t know

43
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:37,511
Haiti is full of nonsense
and superstition.

44
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:40,231
They’re always mixed up
with a lot of mysteries

45
00:06:40,232 --> 00:06:41,632
that will turn your hair grey

46
00:06:42,631 --> 00:06:44,413
I’ve been a missionary here for,

47
00:06:45,214 --> 00:06:46,214
oh, thirty years,

48
00:06:46,313 --> 00:06:49,056
and at times I don’t know what to think.

49
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:51,000
Come, let’s go in the house.

50
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,979
Oh, yes, come dear.

51
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,473
Is Mr. Beaumont in?

52
00:07:04,673 --> 00:07:06,658
You are expected, Dr. Bruner.

53
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:10,423
Yes, I’ve been sent for to marry someone.

54
00:07:12,603 --> 00:07:13,693
Maybe

55
00:07:27,703 --> 00:07:30,220
How long is it that you’ve
known Mr. Beaumont?

56
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:31,730
Oh, only a few days.

57
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,974
Madeline introduced him on
the docks in Port-au-Prince.

58
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,793
Ah, and you?

59
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,010
I met him on the ship coming from New York.

60
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:41,271
He was very kind during the voyage.

61
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:44,127
Madeline and I planned to be
married the moment she arrived,

62
00:07:44,143 --> 00:07:46,621
but Mr. Beaumont persuaded
us to come here.

63
00:07:47,145 --> 00:07:49,600
And he promised to take me out
of the bank at Port-au-Prince

64
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,517
and send me to New York as his agent.

65
00:07:51,627 --> 00:07:54,928
Hmm—strange.

66
00:07:56,354 --> 00:07:57,943
Very strange.

67
00:07:58,151 --> 00:07:59,209
You

68
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,143
I’ll tell Mr. Beaumont you are here.

69
00:08:05,644 --> 00:08:06,344
Yeah

70
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,106
It’s all right, isn’t it doctor?

71
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,192
Oh, I guess so.

72
00:08:18,395 --> 00:08:19,204
You see I

73
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:22,705
I've only met Mr. Beaumont once or twice.

74
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:23,706
but

75
00:08:24,407 --> 00:08:26,750
But he never struck me like the
man who would take the trouble

76
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,298
to play fairy godfather

77
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,063
to a young couple like you.

78
00:08:31,718 --> 00:08:34,052
Unless—

79
00:08:34,484 --> 00:08:35,955
Unless what, sir?

80
00:08:50,277 --> 00:08:53,398
I suppose you’ll think I’m a
meddling old fool, but,

81
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,560
you know, I’d feel a good deal better

82
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,403
if you’d clear out of this place
after you’re married,

83
00:08:58,503 --> 00:09:00,843
and have nothing more
to do with Mr. Beaumont.

84
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:06,800
The young people have arrived sir,

85
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,072
and Dr. Bruner.

86
00:09:08,273 --> 00:09:10,273
They are waiting in the reception hall.

87
00:09:11,272 --> 00:09:13,206
Show them to their rooms,

88
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,707
and tell them I’m out.

89
00:09:14,976 --> 00:09:16,082
No, wait.

90
00:09:17,217 --> 00:09:18,744
Perhaps I’d better see them.

91
00:09:19,128 --> 00:09:20,829
It might look odd if I didn’t

92
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:22,357
Very odd, sir.

93
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:26,057
Especially as Dr. Bruner
is a trife skeptical as

94
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,704
to your—motives, sir.

95
00:09:28,904 --> 00:09:31,033
Nevermind my motives.

96
00:09:31,676 --> 00:09:34,210
Has that other person sent word yet?

97
00:09:34,368 --> 00:09:36,062
No, sir. Not yet.

98
00:09:39,363 --> 00:09:41,163
He’s twenty-four hours late.

99
00:09:43,064 --> 00:09:44,864
I wish you’d keep away from

100
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:46,665
that man, sir

101
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:48,866
He'll make trouble for you.

102
00:09:48,867 --> 00:09:50,367
You wouldn't worry about that

103
00:09:50,568 --> 00:09:51,968
I'm not afraid of him.

104
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:53,969
I not easily frightened, sir.

105
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,570
You should know that.

106
00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:58,271
But what you are planning is dangerous.

107
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:00,672
Don’t you suppose I know that, Silver?

108
00:10:01,673 --> 00:10:04,173
You don’t seem to realize
what this girl means to me.

109
00:10:04,274 --> 00:10:07,574
Why, I’d sacrifice anything I
have in the world for her.

110
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,675
Nothing matters if I can’t have her.

111
00:10:19,676 --> 00:10:21,876
I think, ah, I think you’ll like Haiti.

112
00:10:22,277 --> 00:10:23,577
Most people that—

113
00:10:24,878 --> 00:10:25,578
Oh.

114
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,379
Madeline! I’m delighted to see you.

115
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,680
Neil, you’re more than welcome.

116
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,781
Thank you, sir.

117
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,182
Doctor, it is very kind of you to come

118
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:36,883
I know what a busy man you are.

119
00:10:36,884 --> 00:10:38,284
No, ah, not at all.

120
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:39,285
There is a native family live out here

121
00:10:40,286 --> 00:10:41,986
that I’ve been trying to
see for a long time.

122
00:10:42,487 --> 00:10:44,887
After this young couple
are safely married,

123
00:10:45,188 --> 00:10:46,188
I'll leave.

124
00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:47,889
But surely you will stay for
dinner after the ceremony.

125
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,890
No no no. No, I must run along.

126
00:10:50,391 --> 00:10:51,691
That’s a great pity.

127
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,992
We have something very special

128
00:10:52,993 --> 00:10:54,293
prepared for this occasion.

129
00:10:55,594 --> 00:10:57,094
It was very good of you, Madeline,

130
00:10:57,095 --> 00:10:58,595
to humour the whim of a lonely man.

131
00:10:58,696 --> 00:11:00,696
There was so little time to prepare,

132
00:11:00,697 --> 00:11:03,697
I couldn’t do half the things
I wanted for you.

133
00:11:03,698 --> 00:11:06,698
You’ve done more than enough
already Mr. Beaumont,

134
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,099
for a comparative.

135
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,800
Giving Neil a position in The States.

136
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:10,701
Neil?

137
00:11:10,774 --> 00:11:12,154
Yes. Yes indeed.

138
00:11:12,354 --> 00:11:13,651
Oh, yes of course.

139
00:11:13,652 --> 00:11:15,552
I’m sure Neil will make
a very good agent.

140
00:11:15,651 --> 00:11:18,062
But you must be tired
after your drive.

141
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:19,412
You get some rest.

142
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:20,889
Silver!

143
00:11:22,396 --> 00:11:24,512
Silver will show you to your rooms.

144
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,955
This way please.

145
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:54,081
Delighted to see you again,

146
00:14:54,382 --> 00:14:55,582
monsieur Beaumont.

147
00:15:09,811 --> 00:15:10,954
Please sit.

148
00:15:14,555 --> 00:15:15,555
Please.

149
00:15:21,495 --> 00:15:24,305
I’m sorry to have kept you waiting, Monsieur.

150
00:15:27,532 --> 00:15:29,485
I’ve been on a journey

151
00:15:29,665 --> 00:15:32,399
seeking men for my mills.

152
00:15:33,311 --> 00:15:34,549
Men?

153
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:37,046
They work faithfully,

154
00:15:37,246 --> 00:15:40,590
and they are not worried
about long hours.

155
00:15:42,152 --> 00:15:43,089
You,

156
00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:46,707
you could make good use
of men like mine

157
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,908
on your plantations.

158
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:48,969
No.

159
00:15:51,358 --> 00:15:53,158
That’s not what I want.

160
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:57,071
Then perhaps we should talk

161
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,679
about the young lady who
came to your house this evening.

162
00:15:59,685 --> 00:16:00,989
You’ve seen her?

163
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:02,890
When?

164
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:05,873
The road, tonight.

165
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,114
There...

166
00:16:19,415 --> 00:16:21,615
was a young man with her.

167
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:24,620
They are to be married tonight.

168
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,875
You waited too long to do anything.

169
00:16:26,884 --> 00:16:29,590
What do you want me to do?

170
00:16:30,025 --> 00:16:31,635
If she were to disappear,

171
00:16:31,735 --> 00:16:33,175
for a month—

172
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,594
What do you hope to gain

173
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,095
by her disappearance?

174
00:16:38,396 --> 00:16:39,396
Everything.

175
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:40,694
Everything?

176
00:16:41,094 --> 00:16:43,781
do you think she will forget
her lover in a month?

177
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:45,736
Just give me a month.

178
00:16:46,137 --> 00:16:47,737
One little month.

179
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:50,653
Not in a month.

180
00:16:51,154 --> 00:16:52,654
Not even a year.

181
00:16:55,945 --> 00:16:58,282
I looked into her eyes.

182
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,713
She is deep in love.

183
00:17:04,102 --> 00:17:05,890
But not with you.

184
00:17:06,481 --> 00:17:08,707
They are to be married within an hour.

185
00:17:08,907 --> 00:17:10,823
There must be a way.

186
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,176
There is

187
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:24,877
a way.

188
00:17:27,935 --> 00:17:29,736
The cost.

189
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:33,175
The cost is heavy.

190
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,582
You give me what I want,

191
00:17:36,082 --> 00:17:38,174
and you may ask anything.

192
00:18:02,363 --> 00:18:03,395
No!

193
00:18:04,511 --> 00:18:06,008
Not that!

194
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:31,083
Only a pin point,

195
00:18:31,584 --> 00:18:32,884
monsieur Beaumont,

196
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,620
in a glass of wine

197
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:36,921
or perhaps a flower.

198
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:42,191
Take it.

199
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:44,092
The time is very brief.

200
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,398
You must do your share if
I am to help you.

201
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:51,782
Keep it, Monsieur.

202
00:18:56,406 --> 00:18:57,979
Keep it.

203
00:18:59,108 --> 00:19:01,608
You may change your mind.

204
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:17,269
Send me word

205
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,270
when you use it.

206
00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:35,394
I’ll find another way.

207
00:19:35,494 --> 00:19:37,914
There is no other way.

208
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:58,318
They are driving away evil spirits.

209
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,740
Close it, close it!

210
00:20:04,544 --> 00:20:06,409
Mademoiselle!

211
00:20:24,176 --> 00:20:25,715
I love you, Madeline,

212
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,841
more than anything else
in this whole world.

213
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:30,602
Heaven or hell lies in this
little moment for me.

214
00:20:30,702 --> 00:20:32,673
You could raise me up to paradise

215
00:20:32,674 --> 00:20:34,574
or you could blast my world into nothing.

216
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,354
Its time...even...

217
00:20:36,554 --> 00:20:38,845
I can make you the envy of every woman.

218
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,053
I’d give my life to make you happy.

219
00:20:43,622 --> 00:20:45,973
Oh, listen to me dear
before it’s too late.

220
00:20:46,473 --> 00:20:48,542
Don’t, please.

221
00:20:48,842 --> 00:20:50,341
Don’t go into that room.

222
00:20:50,741 --> 00:20:52,981
We can be in Port-au-Prince
in half an hour.

223
00:20:53,181 --> 00:20:55,434
There’s a boat sailing at midnight.

224
00:20:56,574 --> 00:20:58,673
You’ve been so wonderful.

225
00:20:58,673 --> 00:21:01,013
Don’t spoil everything now.

226
00:21:04,755 --> 00:21:07,509
One last gift before I lose you forever.

227
00:21:51,446 --> 00:21:53,300
We are gathered together

228
00:21:53,601 --> 00:21:55,301
here in the sight of God

229
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,539
and in the face of this company,

230
00:21:57,999 --> 00:21:59,346
to join together

231
00:21:59,347 --> 00:22:00,947
this man, this woman

232
00:22:01,268 --> 00:22:03,047
in holy matrimony.

233
00:22:03,404 --> 00:22:04,404
Faith.

234
00:23:36,368 --> 00:23:38,357
This is the night of nights.

235
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,946
A toast to the bride.

236
00:23:43,247 --> 00:23:44,647
To beauty’s queen.

237
00:23:47,665 --> 00:23:49,543
Gladly, My Lord.

238
00:23:54,442 --> 00:23:56,134
Leave but a kiss

239
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:57,335
within the glass.

240
00:23:58,734 --> 00:24:00,049
Fair gypsy,

241
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,350
read my fortune.

242
00:24:09,702 --> 00:24:11,900
What do you see in the glass?

243
00:24:13,594 --> 00:24:14,723
I see...

244
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:18,231
Happiness.

245
00:24:19,305 --> 00:24:20,328
I see...

246
00:24:21,228 --> 00:24:22,494
Love.

247
00:24:23,194 --> 00:24:24,960
far more than you can bear.

248
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,588
Is that all?

249
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:28,567
Não.

250
00:24:28,993 --> 00:24:29,993
I see...

251
00:24:38,047 --> 00:24:39,047
I see...

252
00:24:39,881 --> 00:24:41,022
What is it?

253
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,282
I see...

254
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:44,783
Death.

255
00:24:46,383 --> 00:24:47,534
Madeline!

256
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,082
Madeline what’s wrong?

257
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:55,285
Madeline my dear, please.

258
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:06,882
No, no!

259
00:25:10,915 --> 00:25:12,951
Madeline. Madeline.

260
00:25:15,205 --> 00:25:16,746
Can’t we do something?

261
00:25:16,947 --> 00:25:18,447
Jesus, Jesus.

262
00:25:19,713 --> 00:25:20,721
Madeline!

263
00:25:31,525 --> 00:25:33,160
Not my wife.

264
00:25:33,461 --> 00:25:34,461
My wife!

265
00:26:04,545 --> 00:26:06,318
Praise of our lord

266
00:26:06,353 --> 00:26:07,501
and saviour

267
00:26:07,602 --> 00:26:09,002
and the love of God

268
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:11,603
and the fellowship of his angels.

269
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,763
Be with us ever more.

270
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:16,009
Amen.

271
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:01,477
Neil.

272
00:27:02,778 --> 00:27:03,478
Neil.

273
00:27:36,004 --> 00:27:36,709
Neil.

274
00:27:38,046 --> 00:27:38,836
Neil.

275
00:27:40,837 --> 00:27:41,537
Neil.

276
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:43,238
Neil!

277
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,393
Look!

278
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,655
Zombies!

279
00:28:53,511 --> 00:28:54,380
Yes.

280
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,426
They are my servants.

281
00:28:57,082 --> 00:28:59,125
Did you think we could do it alone?

282
00:29:00,585 --> 00:29:03,174
In their lifetime they were my enemies.

283
00:29:05,342 --> 00:29:07,555
Ledot, the witch doctor.

284
00:29:08,691 --> 00:29:09,990
Once my master.

285
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,724
Secrets I tortured out of him.

286
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,426
Von Gelder, the swine.

287
00:29:16,427 --> 00:29:17,827
Swollen with riches.

288
00:29:18,426 --> 00:29:21,500
He fought against my
spells until the last.

289
00:29:22,103 --> 00:29:24,744
In him I have a struggling type.

290
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:28,038
His Excellence, Richard.

291
00:29:28,638 --> 00:29:30,755
Once minister of the interior.

292
00:29:32,343 --> 00:29:34,884
Scarpia, Brigand Chief.

293
00:29:36,023 --> 00:29:38,822
Marcquis, Captain of Gendarmerie.

294
00:29:41,207 --> 00:29:42,175
and this

295
00:29:42,476 --> 00:29:44,076
this is Chauvin.

296
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:47,679
The high executioner

297
00:29:49,024 --> 00:29:51,011
who almost executed me!

298
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:57,117
I took them.

299
00:29:58,642 --> 00:30:00,487
just as we will take

300
00:30:02,688 --> 00:30:03,588
this one.

301
00:30:03,987 --> 00:30:06,065
But what if they regain their souls?

302
00:30:08,704 --> 00:30:10,770
They would tear me to pieces.

303
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,483
But that, my friend,

304
00:30:15,145 --> 00:30:16,485
shall never be.

305
00:31:31,006 --> 00:31:32,107
Madeline.

306
00:31:36,409 --> 00:31:37,512
Madeline!

307
00:31:43,734 --> 00:31:44,834
Madeline!

308
00:31:45,335 --> 00:31:46,335
Madeline!

309
00:33:11,988 --> 00:33:14,422
There’s two explanations that strike me,

310
00:33:15,222 --> 00:33:16,938
either the body was stolen

311
00:33:16,938 --> 00:33:18,450
by the members of a death cult

312
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:20,207
that use human bones

313
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:21,408
in their ceremonies,

314
00:33:22,082 --> 00:33:23,050
or else—

315
00:33:23,112 --> 00:33:24,306
Or else what?

316
00:33:24,506 --> 00:33:25,746
She’s not dead.

317
00:33:30,503 --> 00:33:31,839
Not dead?

318
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,040
Are you mad?

319
00:33:34,441 --> 00:33:35,641
I saw her die,

320
00:33:35,939 --> 00:33:37,458
the doctor signed the certificate.

321
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:38,865
I saw them bury her.

322
00:33:38,965 --> 00:33:40,010
Now, wait

323
00:33:40,411 --> 00:33:41,511
wait a minute.

324
00:33:41,512 --> 00:33:42,612
I’m not mad.

325
00:33:43,491 --> 00:33:44,914
But I’ve lived in these islands

326
00:33:44,915 --> 00:33:46,115
for a good many years,

327
00:33:47,154 --> 00:33:48,536
and I’ve seen things

328
00:33:48,536 --> 00:33:49,733
with my eyes

329
00:33:49,734 --> 00:33:51,434
that made me think I was crazy.

330
00:33:53,068 --> 00:33:54,975
There are superstitions in Haiti

331
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,811
that the natives brought
here from Africa.

332
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,652
Some of them

333
00:33:59,653 --> 00:34:01,153
can be traced back as far as

334
00:34:01,154 --> 00:34:02,354
ancient Egypt,

335
00:34:03,748 --> 00:34:04,967
and beyond that yet,

336
00:34:05,067 --> 00:34:06,844
in the countries that was old

337
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:08,245
when Egypt was young.

338
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:08,988
Yes, but

339
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:10,389
what has that to do with Madeline?

340
00:34:10,488 --> 00:34:12,877
I kissed her as she
lay there in the coffin.

341
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,802
And her lips were cold.

342
00:34:17,952 --> 00:34:19,061
Let me explain.

343
00:34:19,062 --> 00:34:20,062
Now, just a minute,

344
00:34:20,063 --> 00:34:21,063
I’ll explain.

345
00:34:21,968 --> 00:34:24,083
Wherever there is a superstition,

346
00:34:24,783 --> 00:34:26,801
you will find there is also a practice.

347
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,350
Now, do you remember
what your driver told you

348
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:30,525
the night that he took you
to Beaumont’s house?

349
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:32,637
Oh, about those horrible creatures we saw.

350
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,338
Yeah.

351
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,674
He said they were corpses!

352
00:34:34,874 --> 00:34:35,960
Taken from their graves.

353
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,161
That's is not real, no.

354
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,556
that’s the superstition!

355
00:34:38,956 --> 00:34:40,050
Now for the practice.

356
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,183
The ghouls

357
00:34:41,184 --> 00:34:43,384
that steal the dead corpses
from their graves,

358
00:34:44,085 --> 00:34:46,085
are supposed to put them
there in the first place.

359
00:34:47,616 --> 00:34:50,010
Do you mean that Madeline was murdered

360
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,159
so that somebody could
steal her dead body?

361
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,460
Aagh! Nonsense.

362
00:34:53,461 --> 00:34:54,361
No, no.

363
00:34:54,762 --> 00:34:55,562
not her dead

364
00:34:55,563 --> 00:34:56,463
not her

365
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,300
Her body, yes;

366
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,543
but not her dead body.

367
00:34:58,544 --> 00:34:59,544
That’s what I meant.

368
00:35:00,795 --> 00:35:03,127
Well surely you don’t think she’s alive,

369
00:35:03,527 --> 00:35:05,021
in the hands of natives!

370
00:35:05,022 --> 00:35:06,922
Oh no, better dead than that.

371
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:09,770
Excuse me please,
have you got a match?

372
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,143
Thank you.

373
00:35:20,759 --> 00:35:22,754
You don’t believe that do you?

374
00:35:24,513 --> 00:35:25,494
Say,

375
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,711
there’s been lots of people

376
00:35:27,712 --> 00:35:29,000
that’s been pronounced dead

377
00:35:29,011 --> 00:35:31,126
that came alive again and
lived for years.

378
00:35:31,827 --> 00:35:32,627
Now, if

379
00:35:32,926 --> 00:35:34,738
nature can play pranks like that,

380
00:35:35,438 --> 00:35:37,785
why isn’t it possible to
play pranks with nature?

381
00:35:37,985 --> 00:35:39,261
Oh, I don’t know.

382
00:35:41,751 --> 00:35:42,910
Your driver

383
00:35:43,611 --> 00:35:45,511
believed he saw dead men,

384
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:47,224
walking.

385
00:35:48,725 --> 00:35:49,725
He didn’t.

386
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:53,113
What he saw were men
alive in everything

387
00:35:53,113 --> 00:35:54,161
but this

388
00:35:54,561 --> 00:35:55,582
and this.

389
00:35:57,554 --> 00:35:59,072
Oh, the whole thing has me

390
00:35:59,373 --> 00:36:00,273
confused.

391
00:36:00,913 --> 00:36:02,514
I just can’t understand it.

392
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,215
um..um

393
00:36:03,216 --> 00:36:04,416
I don’t blame you.

394
00:36:05,117 --> 00:36:05,817
I don't blame you.

395
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,321
I’ve been trying for years

396
00:36:07,322 --> 00:36:08,722
to get to the bottom of these things.

397
00:36:08,921 --> 00:36:10,387
To separate what you call

398
00:36:10,488 --> 00:36:11,588
fact from fiction.

399
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,744
The law.

400
00:36:13,944 --> 00:36:15,529
The law of Haiti acknowledges

401
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,430
the possibility of being buried alive.

402
00:36:18,329 --> 00:36:19,966
Here it is in the penal code.

403
00:36:20,997 --> 00:36:22,295
I’ll read it for you.

404
00:36:23,143 --> 00:36:24,175
Its in French

405
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,168
do you speak French?

406
00:36:25,169 --> 00:36:25,869
No.

407
00:36:27,468 --> 00:36:29,310
Excuse me please,
have you got a match?

408
00:36:29,611 --> 00:36:30,711
Right here, here’s one.

409
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,172
Oh, thank you. I didn’t see it there.

410
00:36:32,472 --> 00:36:33,744
I’ll translate it for you.

411
00:36:33,945 --> 00:36:35,245
If you could spare me.

412
00:36:36,044 --> 00:36:37,141
"Article"

413
00:36:38,042 --> 00:36:39,142
Article 2:49.

414
00:36:41,043 --> 00:36:41,943
The use...

415
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:45,212
"The use of drugs or other practices

416
00:36:45,612 --> 00:36:47,589
which produce lethargic coma,

417
00:36:48,489 --> 00:36:50,218
or lifeless sleep,

418
00:36:51,318 --> 00:36:52,563
shall be considered

419
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,264
attempted murder."

420
00:36:54,465 --> 00:36:55,265
Yes.

421
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,146
attempeted.

422
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,108
Yes I see.

423
00:36:57,109 --> 00:36:58,309
Yeah, alright now, wait

424
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,695
"If the person has been buried alive,

425
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:03,977
the act should be considered murder

426
00:37:04,577 --> 00:37:06,457
no matter what result follows."

427
00:37:08,273 --> 00:37:09,230
Beaumont!

428
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:12,607
Say, you said you couldn’t understand

429
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:14,208
why he was so interested in us.

430
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:16,454
Do you think he did this?

431
00:37:16,455 --> 00:37:17,155
No.

432
00:37:17,481 --> 00:37:18,933
No, I think his natives would.

433
00:37:19,234 --> 00:37:20,334
Natives would be right.

434
00:37:21,136 --> 00:37:24,052
Of course if you want to, we
could go to Beaumont’s house first.

435
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,875
If I could get my hands

436
00:37:28,076 --> 00:37:29,776
on the devil that’s responsible for this,

437
00:37:31,477 --> 00:37:32,977
I’ll make him such an example

438
00:37:32,978 --> 00:37:34,678
that every witch doctor in Haiti

439
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:36,179
would be shaking in his sandals.

440
00:37:36,475 --> 00:37:38,383
But we can’t do this alone.

441
00:37:39,283 --> 00:37:40,787
Can’t the authorities help?

442
00:37:41,888 --> 00:37:43,888
The authorities, Neil, my boy,

443
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,142
you don’t know these islands.

444
00:37:46,742 --> 00:37:48,545
The native authorities are
afraid to meddle.

445
00:37:49,345 --> 00:37:50,144
I am not.

446
00:37:50,544 --> 00:37:51,936
I’ve got friends among
the natives.

447
00:37:53,091 --> 00:37:54,751
They’ll tell me things that no jandam

448
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,243
could ever get out of you.

449
00:37:57,343 --> 00:37:58,563
Because

450
00:37:58,764 --> 00:38:00,064
I am a preacher

451
00:38:00,565 --> 00:38:01,865
they think I am a magician.

452
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,866
Before we get through
with this thing,

453
00:38:07,867 --> 00:38:09,567
we may uncover sins

454
00:38:10,268 --> 00:38:12,268
that even the devil
would be ashamed of.

455
00:38:15,563 --> 00:38:16,311
Oh,

456
00:38:16,512 --> 00:38:18,112
these witch doctors

457
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:37,053
Madeline.

458
00:40:28,496 --> 00:40:29,573
Foolish things,

459
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,493
they can’t bring back

460
00:40:32,494 --> 00:40:33,794
the light to those eyes.

461
00:40:37,657 --> 00:40:39,143
I was mad to do this

462
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,668
but if you had smiled on me,

463
00:40:43,568 --> 00:40:45,446
I’d have done anything for you.

464
00:40:45,746 --> 00:40:47,336
Given you anything.

465
00:40:49,437 --> 00:40:50,937
I thought that beauty alone

466
00:40:50,938 --> 00:40:52,038
would satisfy

467
00:40:54,421 --> 00:40:55,962
but the soul is gone.

468
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,230
I can’t bear those

469
00:40:59,231 --> 00:41:00,731
empty staring eyes.

470
00:41:04,534 --> 00:41:06,313
Oh, forgive me Madeline.

471
00:41:06,314 --> 00:41:07,514
Forgive me!

472
00:41:09,486 --> 00:41:11,231
I can’t bear it any longer.

473
00:41:12,032 --> 00:41:13,432
I must take you back!

474
00:41:16,687 --> 00:41:18,180
Back to the grave,

475
00:41:18,781 --> 00:41:19,681
Monsieur?

476
00:41:21,954 --> 00:41:22,759
No,

477
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:25,249
you must put the life
back into her eyes

478
00:41:26,314 --> 00:41:27,902
and bring laughter to her lips.

479
00:41:28,763 --> 00:41:30,870
She must be gay and happy again.

480
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,967
You paint a charming picture, Monsieur.

481
00:41:35,067 --> 00:41:36,952
One that I should like to see

482
00:41:37,153 --> 00:41:38,153
myself.

483
00:42:00,469 --> 00:42:01,901
You must bring her back.

484
00:42:02,957 --> 00:42:04,852
Aren’t you a trife afraid,

485
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:05,953
Monsieur?

486
00:42:06,536 --> 00:42:08,395
How do you suppose those eyes

487
00:42:08,696 --> 00:42:09,796
will regard you

488
00:42:10,546 --> 00:42:12,785
when the brain is able to understand?

489
00:42:46,776 --> 00:42:48,172
Better to see hatred in them

490
00:42:48,973 --> 00:42:50,673
than that dreadful emptiness.

491
00:42:51,772 --> 00:42:52,967
Perhaps you’re right.

492
00:42:54,167 --> 00:42:55,297
It would be a pity to

493
00:42:55,298 --> 00:42:56,998
destroy such a lovely flower.

494
00:43:00,687 --> 00:43:02,086
Let’s drink to the future

495
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,087
of this flower.

496
00:43:03,486 --> 00:43:04,763
A glass of wine!

497
00:43:07,464 --> 00:43:08,364
Silver,

498
00:43:08,449 --> 00:43:09,456
bring wine.

499
00:43:10,257 --> 00:43:11,757
We have a toast to drink.

500
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,190
To the future,

501
00:43:41,491 --> 00:43:42,391
Monsieur.

502
00:43:58,546 --> 00:43:59,706
Only

503
00:44:00,007 --> 00:44:02,007
a pin point, Monsieur.

504
00:44:03,406 --> 00:44:04,531
In a flower

505
00:44:05,631 --> 00:44:06,639
or perhaps

506
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,340
a glass of wine.

507
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:17,943
You...

508
00:44:18,344 --> 00:44:19,944
What are you trying to do to me?

509
00:44:21,133 --> 00:44:23,255
I have other plans for Mademoiselle.

510
00:44:24,735 --> 00:44:25,824
I am afraid

511
00:44:25,925 --> 00:44:27,025
you might not agree.

512
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:35,036
I have taken a fancy to you,

513
00:44:36,037 --> 00:44:36,937
Monsieur.

514
00:44:37,998 --> 00:44:38,805
Silver!

515
00:44:39,106 --> 00:44:39,906
Silver!

516
00:45:48,034 --> 00:45:48,716
Don’t,

517
00:45:49,017 --> 00:45:49,817
don't.

518
00:46:20,257 --> 00:46:21,822
To the future,

519
00:46:22,023 --> 00:46:22,923
Monsieur.

520
00:46:49,741 --> 00:46:50,768
The vulture,

521
00:46:51,668 --> 00:46:52,576
you

522
00:47:01,977 --> 00:47:02,945
No.

523
00:47:02,946 --> 00:47:04,046
Not that.

524
00:47:04,547 --> 00:47:05,647
Not that!

525
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:13,103
We ought to be picking up an old witch doctor

526
00:47:13,104 --> 00:47:14,304
around here pretty soon.

527
00:47:14,655 --> 00:47:16,042
His name is Pierre,

528
00:47:16,643 --> 00:47:17,843
I’ve known him for years.

529
00:47:17,942 --> 00:47:19,192
Bright old fellow.

530
00:47:20,411 --> 00:47:22,736
I don’t know just where we’ll find him.

531
00:47:43,207 --> 00:47:44,590
Come son.

532
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:45,824
There are

533
00:47:45,825 --> 00:47:46,825
evil

534
00:47:47,226 --> 00:47:48,826
spirits in the road.

535
00:47:49,727 --> 00:47:51,327
I will give you

536
00:47:52,028 --> 00:47:53,228
an awonga.

537
00:47:55,494 --> 00:47:56,680
And here,

538
00:47:56,881 --> 00:47:58,481
this one for the ox.

539
00:48:08,811 --> 00:48:09,871
Young man

540
00:48:10,072 --> 00:48:11,872
is sick with distress.

541
00:48:13,988 --> 00:48:15,025
Well hey,

542
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:16,026
wait a minute,

543
00:48:16,027 --> 00:48:17,327
we can’t afford to have you sick.

544
00:48:18,306 --> 00:48:19,725
Neil, why don’t you go over there,

545
00:48:19,726 --> 00:48:21,326
we've got a hard day before us tomorrow.

546
00:48:25,544 --> 00:48:26,896
Now, now then Pierre, come on.

547
00:48:27,197 --> 00:48:27,997
He's gone.

548
00:48:28,298 --> 00:48:29,198
We can talk.

549
00:48:29,799 --> 00:48:31,499
It is a dangerous thing

550
00:48:31,725 --> 00:48:33,300
you ask me to do.

551
00:48:33,501 --> 00:48:34,701
Well now listen here

552
00:48:35,302 --> 00:48:36,702
you know, we're old friends,

553
00:48:36,703 --> 00:48:38,403
you and me, and I want to go on.

554
00:48:38,704 --> 00:48:40,004
Turn back

555
00:48:40,105 --> 00:48:41,705
before it is too late.

556
00:48:42,006 --> 00:48:42,806
Oh, no.

557
00:48:42,807 --> 00:48:44,507
I’ve come too far to turn back now.

558
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:46,708
I’m too old to go

559
00:48:47,109 --> 00:48:48,809
all the way with you.

560
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:50,710
Well listen,

561
00:48:50,811 --> 00:48:51,611
can’t

562
00:48:51,612 --> 00:48:53,112
can’t you get somebody to go with us?

563
00:48:53,987 --> 00:48:54,849
My people

564
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:57,550
all afraid of the mountain.

565
00:48:58,449 --> 00:48:59,390
Why?

566
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:00,631
Because

567
00:49:01,032 --> 00:49:01,932
it is called

568
00:49:02,433 --> 00:49:03,433
the land

569
00:49:03,634 --> 00:49:05,534
of the living dead.

570
00:49:06,565 --> 00:49:07,824
Well, have,

571
00:49:08,225 --> 00:49:09,625
have you ever been there?

572
00:49:10,224 --> 00:49:12,583
I am the only man

573
00:49:13,484 --> 00:49:15,484
that has ever come
back from there

574
00:49:16,085 --> 00:49:17,085
alive.

575
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:23,048
There is an evil spirit man

576
00:49:24,649 --> 00:49:25,949
that is called

577
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:27,850
"Murder".

578
00:49:28,351 --> 00:49:29,051
Come,

579
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:31,379
I will tell you

580
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,680
all about what he did.

581
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,420
Vulture.

582
00:50:40,661 --> 00:50:42,426
Just as old Pierre said.

583
00:50:43,709 --> 00:50:45,031
A cloud of vultures

584
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:47,032
always hovers over the house

585
00:50:47,331 --> 00:50:48,608
of the living dead.

586
00:50:51,533 --> 00:50:52,562
Madeline.

587
00:50:53,494 --> 00:50:54,688
Is she there?

588
00:50:54,689 --> 00:50:55,389
No.

589
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,051
Oh, I must go and see her.

590
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,581
Oh, no, no, no, no.

591
00:50:58,582 --> 00:50:59,582
Neil my boy,

592
00:51:00,183 --> 00:51:01,583
please, please

593
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:02,784
lie down and rest.

594
00:51:03,285 --> 00:51:04,185
Please.

595
00:51:06,126 --> 00:51:08,126
You’ll feel stronger in the morning.

596
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,665
You rest.

597
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:15,909
Let me go up and

598
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:17,310
see what I can do.

599
00:51:40,611 --> 00:51:43,011
Why is she so restless tonight?

600
00:51:44,012 --> 00:51:46,012
Perhaps she remembers something.

601
00:51:47,713 --> 00:51:50,513
They never remember anything

602
00:51:50,814 --> 00:51:52,414
when they are like that.

603
00:51:52,815 --> 00:51:53,715
No?

604
00:51:54,616 --> 00:51:55,616
Because

605
00:51:56,617 --> 00:51:58,017
she's cut off.

606
00:52:44,313 --> 00:52:45,333
Madeline.

607
00:52:46,634 --> 00:52:47,834
Madeline!

608
00:53:25,643 --> 00:53:26,712
No, no

609
00:53:26,813 --> 00:53:28,313
I can’t, I can’t.

610
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:29,914
You must,

611
00:53:30,115 --> 00:53:31,215
it's your turn.

612
00:53:32,116 --> 00:53:33,116
Let’s run away.

613
00:53:33,117 --> 00:53:33,817
Shh!

614
00:53:35,718 --> 00:53:37,118
He might hear you.

615
00:53:37,819 --> 00:53:38,619
No way.

616
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:39,920
I can’t stand it.

617
00:53:40,121 --> 00:53:41,621
I am going to run away.

618
00:53:42,822 --> 00:53:44,122
He will find you

619
00:53:44,623 --> 00:53:46,123
and make you like her.

620
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:01,740
Can you still hear me?

621
00:55:08,633 --> 00:55:10,483
It is unfortunate you are no longer

622
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:11,984
able to speak.

623
00:55:13,785 --> 00:55:15,085
I should be interested to hear

624
00:55:15,286 --> 00:55:17,086
you describe your symptoms.

625
00:55:29,287 --> 00:55:30,787
You see, you

626
00:55:31,688 --> 00:55:33,488
are the first man to know

627
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:35,489
what is happening.

628
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:41,290
None

629
00:55:41,391 --> 00:55:42,591
of the others

630
00:55:43,292 --> 00:55:44,292
did.

631
00:56:05,148 --> 00:56:06,509
You refused

632
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:07,910
to shake hands

633
00:56:07,911 --> 00:56:08,911
once.

634
00:56:09,812 --> 00:56:11,112
I remember.

635
00:56:13,313 --> 00:56:14,513
Well, well.

636
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:16,514
We understand each other

637
00:56:16,415 --> 00:56:17,715
better now.

638
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:20,900
Madeline!

639
01:02:26,855 --> 01:02:28,250
Madeline!

640
01:02:51,835 --> 01:02:52,861
Madeline,

641
01:02:56,052 --> 01:02:57,331
Madeline.

642
01:02:57,472 --> 01:02:58,626
I found you.

643
01:02:59,027 --> 01:03:00,227
You're alive.

644
01:03:00,728 --> 01:03:01,828
Alive!

645
01:03:02,829 --> 01:03:04,129
What’s the matter?

646
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:05,730
It's I, Neil.

647
01:03:17,253 --> 01:03:18,743
Oh my darling,

648
01:03:19,644 --> 01:03:21,144
what have they done to you?

649
01:03:41,622 --> 01:03:42,874
Who are you?

650
01:03:45,775 --> 01:03:46,975
And what are they?

651
01:03:47,076 --> 01:03:48,276
To you my friend,

652
01:03:48,277 --> 01:03:49,777
they are dangers of death.

653
01:04:26,419 --> 01:04:27,418
Come!

654
01:04:27,419 --> 01:04:28,419
Zombies!

655
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:29,420
Duck!

656
01:04:49,529 --> 01:04:50,529
Look!

657
01:05:38,835 --> 01:05:39,885
Madeline,

658
01:05:40,486 --> 01:05:41,986
don’t you know me dear?

659
01:05:42,687 --> 01:05:43,787
It’s Neil.

660
01:05:44,088 --> 01:05:45,288
I could swear,

661
01:05:46,489 --> 01:05:48,089
for a moment she recognized you.

662
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:53,490
Come on, don’t let him get away.

663
01:06:51,576 --> 01:06:53,198
Madeline my darling!

664
01:07:04,527 --> 01:07:05,930
Neil, I

665
01:07:06,431 --> 01:07:07,631
I dreamed.

666
01:07:16,411 --> 01:07:17,791
Excuse me please,

667
01:07:18,092 --> 01:07:19,492
have you got a match?
