1
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:00,761
Gosh, but this story of mine
should be great.

2
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,831
I really don't know
how the people can wait. Ha, ha.

3
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:10,564
Hmm. I have to decide
who the actors will be.

4
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:14,002
I think I'll make the heroine me.
Ha-ha-ha.

5
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:19,271
Mm. The hero Aladdin
is handsome and smart.

6
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:23,041
Why, Popeye the sailor
is great for the part.

7
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,938
I ought to open up a chain store.

8
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,620
Make way for the princess.

9
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,392
Make way for the princess.

10
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,543
Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

11
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:37,555
Whoa. I better unratchet myself here, huh?

12
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,692
Oh, a pretzel bender, huh?

13
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:51,728
Thy reign will soon be over
when my secret I unhide.

14
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:55,773
Then I shall be the ruler
and you shall be my bride.

15
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:01,806
Yeah.

16
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:07,946
Let me see. Where was I,
where was I? Yeah.

17
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:17,721
Ah.

18
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:40,580
Aladdin shall help me
this lamp to obtain.

19
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,223
Then Aladdin shall never be seen again.

20
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:20,623
Yes, yes, Aladdin,
the princess has chosen you...

21
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,888
...to procure for her the magic lamp.

22
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:26,033
Well, she made a good choice
and I'm just the fellow who can do it.

23
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:32,738
Why only you alone would be on such
a precarious mission, yes, yes, yes.

24
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:35,773
Say, you're out of "breathe."
You better lay down for a couple years.

25
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,378
Beneath that rock
is a dangerous passageway...

26
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,640
- Is that so?
- ...beyond which you will find...

27
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:45,251
...a golden lamp.
Bring that lamp back to me.

28
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,877
Bring that lamp back to you, huh?
Anything for the princess.

29
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,995
Mm.

30
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,764
I go for the princess.

31
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:06,565
Yes, yes, Aladdin. Go on, go on.

32
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,708
Yes. I go.

33
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,570
I'm gone. Ha-ha-ha.

34
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,629
Blow me down. It's perfect.

35
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:02,294
Boy, lamp the lad. That must be made
out of "sapph-fires," I guess, huh?

36
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,332
Oh, boy. I made good, I made good.
Ha-ha-ha!

37
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,561
Mm. Ah, the suspense is terrible.

38
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,899
I wish Aladdin would hurry
with that lamp.

39
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,976
Hey, mister. Mister, I got the lamp.

40
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,577
All for the princess.

41
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,578
The lamp. Ha-ha-ha.

42
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,113
For the princess.

43
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,764
POPEYE; Yeah, that's right,
for the princess. I got it right...

44
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,048
Oh!

45
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,713
The princess. Ha-ha-ha!

46
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,656
That was only a trick, my fool.

47
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:38,890
Only you and I know of this magic lamp...

48
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,467
...and soon you will forget. Ha, ha.

49
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:45,965
Ow!

50
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,683
It's mine. I have it. It's mine.

51
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,184
Ow! Ooh!

52
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,721
My lamp. The lamp.

53
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:08,726
The lamp. The lamp.

54
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,065
I want the lamp.

55
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,802
Ow! Oh!

56
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,705
Whoa. Hey, what happened? Where am I,
and how do I get out of this place?

57
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:31,476
That's what I wanna know, yep, yep.

58
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,279
This place looks kind of spooky to me.
Ouch! Ooh!

59
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,389
Ooh, that burns me up.

60
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,857
Ooh, I wish I was lightheaded
so I could see what I'm doing.

61
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:44,793
Well, here's my last match.
I hope I strike it lucky, that's all.

62
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,896
Oh.

63
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,372
- Whoa. Come on, put up your dukes.
- Oh, for goodness' sake.

64
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,943
Hey, who are you?
Where'd you come from?

65
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,636
Are you the janitor or something, huh?

66
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,645
I am the flame of the lamp.

67
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,774
I come from nowhere,
I go to the no place, and here I am.

68
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,580
You make a wish and I give it.

69
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,288
You want something?

70
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:15,520
Did you say "a wish"?
A wish, a wish. I can have a wish, huh?

71
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,424
Well, I wish I was out of here.

72
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,565
Can you show me
the entrance to the exit?

73
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,600
- Oh, certainly.
- Well, let's get out of here.

74
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,204
You said it.

75
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,100
Hey, take it easy. Quit your shoving.
Quit your pushing, young fellow.

76
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,870
I hope I know what you're doing.

77
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,610
Wow!

78
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,746
Oh, boy. Ha-ha-ha!

79
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,218
Oh, an escalator.

80
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,849
Women's and ladies' bargain basement
on the top floor.

81
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,697
Main entrance, all out.
Ha-ha-ha!

82
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,926
Boy, I'm glad to get out of
that hole all right. Ha-ha-ha!

83
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,900
Now if only I could find the... Uh? Ooh.

84
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:04,535
If you don't see what you want,
rub for it.

85
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,645
Hmm. That's a very good idea,
if I say so.

86
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,611
Think I'll try it.

87
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,580
Hey, you.

88
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,016
Oh, for goodness' sake.

89
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:19,488
You want something?

90
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,424
Yeah. What's all this magical stuff about?

91
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:26,623
Well, I told you. I could fulfill up
any wish or desire.

92
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,599
Hmm. There's something funny
about this phony. Gotta test him out.

93
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,362
I think I'll give him a tough one.

94
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:34,633
Okay, I wish I was a wealthy prince.
Ha-ha-ha.

95
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:37,971
You said it.

96
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:41,114
Hey, what's going on around here?

97
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,544
Oh, boy.

98
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:59,062
What can I do for you?

99
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:02,998
I'd do most anything you asked me to

100
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:06,469
I'd go and get that pot of gold
From the rainbow.

101
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,437
And bring it where you are.

102
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,976
And then I'd hitch your wagon to a star.

103
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:15,046
What can I do for you?

104
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:19,049
Say, how'd you like to have
Your dreams come true?

105
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:22,746
I'd like to make you happy
Through and through.

106
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,390
'Deed I do.

107
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:28,551
So what can I do for you?

108
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:33,523
Thank you, thank you, very much,
all of you. Ha-ha-ha!

109
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,225
Get us gone, Biscuit.

110
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,245
It's Aladdin. He's alive.

111
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,951
He has the magic lamp.

112
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,851
But he shan't have it long.

113
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,434
Oh, I hope the princess is home,
that's all. Ha-ha.

114
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:19,110
Oh. Well, I got the lamp here.

115
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,907
Oh, rub-a, rub-a, rub-a, rub-a-dub, eh?

116
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,713
- Hey.
- Oh.

117
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,579
At your service.

118
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:30,314
Bring me up a chest full of precious pearls
and diamonds and stuff...

119
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,083
...and take it to the princess.

120
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,817
To her?

121
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,758
You said it.

122
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,365
Hocus pocus.

123
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:48,367
Take that to the princess
with my complications, that's right.

124
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,349
Presents from Aladdin for the princess.

125
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:01,249
Salami, salami, bologna.

126
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,616
Oh.

127
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:06,754
Oh!

128
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,292
Oh!

129
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:19,531
Oh, they're superb. Bliss. Oh!

130
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,830
Oh.

131
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,106
Mm.

132
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,146
That must be Prince Aladdin.

133
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:39,952
Oh, be still my fluttering heart.

134
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,193
Yoo-hoo! Hello.

135
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:46,731
Oh, boy, the princess.
Ha-ha-ha! To the rescue.

136
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,025
I got it.

137
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:52,532
In reverse.

138
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,839
Alley-up. Ha, ha!

139
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,878
Uh, I think you dropped something.

140
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,539
Oh, thank you, big, tall and handsome.

141
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,582
Well, I'm not so tall but...

142
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,080
I better get rid of this sticker. She'll
think I'm a little cut up or something, huh?

143
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:17,921
Curses.

144
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,498
Oh, uh, fair one, will thou...?

145
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:29,108
Er, uh... That is, wilst you...?

146
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,538
Yes, yes?

147
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,804
Oh, "yes, yes", huh?

148
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,641
Ooh, I am embarrassed.
I don't know what to say.

149
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,910
I never made love in Technicolor before.
I don't know...

150
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,852
Princess, wouldst it please thee...

151
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,992
- ...or, uh, wouldst it please thou...?
- Oh.

152
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,150
What are you, a thee or a thou, huh?

153
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,195
Fairest one, I was about to ea yest that...

154
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,696
- Yes, I'll marry you.
- Oh, oh, oh!

155
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,267
You will? Oh, she's gonna marry me.
Oh, she's wonderful.

156
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:59,462
I think she's making a big mistake
but I don't know... Oh!

157
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,869
I go to bring my friends to the wedding...

158
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:09,140
...but I shall return. Ha-ha-ha!

159
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,976
Oh, don't forget to come back.

160
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,812
Hi de ho, Silver...

161
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:16,978
...away!

162
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:26,793
Oh!

163
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,992
Oh, dear. What was that?

164
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:33,739
Who left that junk laying around here?

165
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:38,836
The lamp.

166
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,416
I have a plan.

167
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:50,580
Oh, attendants, attend me.

168
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,522
New lamps for old.

169
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:06,331
Oh, see if you can help that poor man.

170
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,441
Then send him away.

171
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:14,011
New lamps for old.

172
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,211
New lamps for old.

173
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,044
Oh.

174
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,054
Oh.

175
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,463
Ha-ha-ha. It's mine.

176
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:40,371
Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

177
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,436
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

178
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,275
- Prince Aladdin.
- Hooray.

179
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:54,811
Aladdin, Aladdin, Aladdin.

180
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,924
Yoo-hoo, princey.

181
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,325
- Yoo-hoo!
- Oh, you came back.

182
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:07,262
The man who came back, that's me.
Oh-ho.

183
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,164
Thank you. Thank you, very much.

184
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,606
Ah. No one here. Now is my chance.

185
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:20,269
Come, princess. You'll soon be mine.

186
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,611
- Bah!
- Oh!

187
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,011
You want something?

188
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,555
Go. I command you.

189
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:35,183
Carry this castle off
to a far and distant land.

190
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,728
You're crazy.

191
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:40,366
I'm crazy, huh?
Well, you'll do as I say.

192
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,433
I'll whip you within an inch
of your life.

193
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:44,400
I didn't say I wouldn't.

194
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,436
Then go.

195
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,157
Hey, get up and go. Oof!

196
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,691
What a letdown.

197
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,061
Hey, where's the castle?
Where...? Where's the princess?

198
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,655
Where's my clothes? They're lost.
It's a "lost-suit." Oh!

199
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,666
Now my princess, get inside there.

200
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,895
Aladdin's a faker.

201
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,876
Down with Aladdin.

202
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,951
It's black magic.

203
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,752
Get rid of him.

204
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:38,982
Whoa!

205
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:48,362
Unrelease me.

206
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:57,038
Oh, Popeye... I mean, Aladdin, save me!

207
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,904
I'm pent up in a penthouse.

208
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,773
- Aargh!
- Oh!

209
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:03,473
Aah! Curses.

210
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,782
Oh! Let me go.

211
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,625
Guards to destroy Aladdin.

212
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:19,459
Oh, yeah? Spinach to fix the guards.

213
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,997
Oh, hello, you two.

214
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:24,193
Unh! Take that.

215
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:31,343
Now for a vulture.

216
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,174
Oh, yeah?
Spinach to cook the vulture's goose.

217
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:45,158
Then a dragon.

218
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:49,792
Oh, Grandma,
what big teeth you've got.

219
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,958
You're not so hot yourself.

220
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:09,238
- Oh!
- Ha-ha-ha!

221
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,548
Where is that guy? Let me get
my hands on him. Wait till I get...

222
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,018
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

223
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:21,511
Where is that fellow? He was here
a minute ago. I saw it with my own eyes.

224
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,153
- Aargh!
- Whoa! Hey, quit sticking me.

225
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,765
Ow! Ooh, it's like a brick wall
here or something. Huh?

226
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,812
Must be a magician or something.
I don't know...

227
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,368
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Whoa!

228
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,630
The tables have turned.

229
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:35,274
Oh, yeah? Take that. Oh, yeah?

230
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,343
Hey, there must be
an apparition somewhere.

231
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:49,986
Oh, yeah?

232
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:53,920
You missed.

233
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,806
Help, I'm a fish.

234
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:09,939
Give me a moment.

235
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:13,339
- There we are.
- Oh.

236
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:18,007
So long, sport.

237
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:19,276
So long.

238
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:20,681
So long, toots.

239
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:21,945
Oh, goodbye.

240
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,657
I said it.

241
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:39,437
Now, where was I?
Oh, let me think a minute now.

242
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,233
Oh, yes, I remember. Oh.

243
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:51,274
- Letter for you, Olive.
- Oh, at last.

244
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,681
The picture's finished. Oh.
