1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,288
Officer, can you tell me
the way to Three Rivers?

2
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:15,314
About two miles to the first
main intersection, then turn left,

3
00:00:15,314 --> 00:00:16,776
it's about 60 miles.

4
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:19,837
- Thanks. What town is this?
- "Suddenly".

5
00:00:19,837 --> 00:00:22,482
- Suddenly what?
- No, that's the name.

6
00:00:22,482 --> 00:00:26,760
- Ha, ha, it's a funny name for a town.
- Hangover from the old days.

7
00:00:27,352 --> 00:00:29,891
That's the way things used
to happen here. Suddenly.

8
00:00:29,891 --> 00:00:30,901
I see.

9
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:35,006
- Road agents, gamblers, gun fighters.
- Well, I take it things have changed.

10
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:37,024
Things happen so slow now

11
00:00:37,024 --> 00:00:40,642
the town council wants to change
the name to 'Gradually'.

12
00:00:40,642 --> 00:00:43,982
- Ha ha, thanks officer.
- Pleasure, come back.

13
00:00:56,716 --> 00:00:57,550
Suddenly

14
00:02:04,278 --> 00:02:06,122
Hello there, Pidge.

15
00:02:06,122 --> 00:02:08,836
- Hi Tod.
- Where's your mother?

16
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:13,045
We've been shopping. I gotta' put
this stuff in the car, wanna' come?

17
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:14,820
Yeah, sure.

18
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:19,621
- Tod?
- Uh huh.

19
00:02:20,316 --> 00:02:24,457
Well no. I guess not.
She wouldn't let me.

20
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:26,962
- Who's she?
- Mom of course.

21
00:02:27,274 --> 00:02:29,362
Well then you'd better
say Mom, Pidge.

22
00:02:29,362 --> 00:02:32,215
It's kinda' not polite to say 'she',
especially about your mother.

23
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:34,581
Well anyway, she wouldn't.

24
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,190
You know, I bet I can guess
what's on your mind.

25
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:38,652
Bet you can't.

26
00:02:38,652 --> 00:02:42,374
Well, now let's see.
You want an ice-cream soda?

27
00:02:42,374 --> 00:02:45,540
Um, not a bad idea,
but that's not it.

28
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,897
You wanna' go
to the movies?

29
00:02:46,897 --> 00:02:50,202
No, that's a war picture.
Mom won't let me see those.

30
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:53,194
Boy oh boy,
this is tougher than I thought.

31
00:02:53,194 --> 00:02:58,482
- I got it, you want that baseball bat.
- No, but you're awful warm.

32
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:02,900
Is that it?

33
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:08,188
Sure that's it. Ain't it a beauty?
But shucks, it's no use.

34
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,041
Mom won't let me have it.
She doesn't like guns.

35
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:12,363
I know.

36
00:03:12,363 --> 00:03:15,633
It's because of my father
being killed in the war.

37
00:03:15,877 --> 00:03:18,347
Look Pidge, if you had the gun,
what would you do with it?

38
00:03:18,347 --> 00:03:21,026
- Stick up a filling station?
- Stick up a filling station.

39
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:23,148
Heck no, I'd be Sheriff,

40
00:03:23,148 --> 00:03:26,940
and I'd catch all those road agents
and cattle rustlers. Just like you.

41
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:29,098
But what about Mom?

42
00:03:29,828 --> 00:03:33,133
I think we can persuade her, what with
you wanting to be a peace officer.

43
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:36,786
We've got lots of time. Mom's still
in the market getting groceries.

44
00:03:38,074 --> 00:03:39,604
Let's go.

45
00:03:55,817 --> 00:03:58,113
- Oh hell...
- I got it.

46
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,435
Thanks Tod. Hello.

47
00:03:59,435 --> 00:04:01,348
Hi, can I give you
a lift to the house?

48
00:04:01,348 --> 00:04:03,505
Thanks, but I have
the car with me.

49
00:04:03,505 --> 00:04:05,662
- Goin' to church tomorrow?
- Yes.

50
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,819
I'll pick you up
about 10:45, huh?

51
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:10,359
You never give up,
do you?

52
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,882
Ellen, I know how you feel, believe me
I do, and I've tried to understand, but...

53
00:04:14,882 --> 00:04:16,900
I haven't asked you
to understand.

54
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:23,371
- That's because I'm in love with you.
- Tod... you shouldn't say that to me.

55
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:27,058
- Why not? It's true.
- Don't Tod.

56
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,233
Ellen, you can't go on
being a widow forever.

57
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:33,529
It's been over three years
since Pete died.

58
00:04:34,156 --> 00:04:36,765
Don't you understand?
No one can take Pete's place.

59
00:04:36,765 --> 00:04:40,140
I'm not trying to take Pete's place.
I'm trying to make a place of my own.

60
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:46,820
You've been wonderful Tod, and I'm
grateful, but I can't help how I feel.

61
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,586
Ellen, you've got to stop
doing this to yourself,

62
00:04:51,586 --> 00:04:53,847
because you're doing it
to Pidge too, and to me.

63
00:04:53,847 --> 00:04:56,456
You're digging a big pit
and shoving all of us into it.

64
00:04:56,456 --> 00:04:59,240
Leave me alone Tod,
please.

65
00:05:02,545 --> 00:05:04,040
Pidge,
where did you get that gun?

66
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,972
- I bought it for him, Ellen.
- Tod, how could you?

67
00:05:08,632 --> 00:05:12,112
We thought you wouldn't mind,
cos' I'm gonna' be a sheriff, like Tod.

68
00:05:12,739 --> 00:05:14,756
- Take it off Pidge.
- Ellen.

69
00:05:14,756 --> 00:05:17,644
I can't help it, I can't stand
seeing him play with a gun.

70
00:05:17,644 --> 00:05:21,088
But the boy's gotta' learn sometime
that guns aren't necessarily bad.

71
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:24,323
- Depends on who uses them.
- Tod carries one, doesn't he?

72
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:26,515
- Yes.
- Well then.

73
00:05:26,515 --> 00:05:29,716
- Just take it off, Pidge.
- Aw gee!

74
00:05:32,464 --> 00:05:37,474
That's three dollars, please...
Thank you.

75
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:41,197
Ellen.

76
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:45,406
I know you don't want the boy
to see war pictures, but it seems...

77
00:05:45,406 --> 00:05:48,712
Teaching children the art of death and
destruction, the cruelties, the tortures...

78
00:05:48,712 --> 00:05:52,156
He's gotta' know that these things exist
and then he can fight against them,

79
00:05:52,156 --> 00:05:55,530
when it's his turn.
You can't wrap the boy in cellophane.

80
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,105
I can try, as long as possible.

81
00:05:58,105 --> 00:06:02,350
Look, when a house is on fire,
everybody has to help put it out,

82
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,985
because the next time,
it might be your house.

83
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:06,002
Oh Tod, don't.

84
00:06:16,022 --> 00:06:19,327
- Church tomorrow, Ellen?
- No Tod, I can't go with you.

85
00:06:19,327 --> 00:06:23,571
I can't go on asking you and
get turned down. I mean that.

86
00:06:50,186 --> 00:06:54,569
Bebop. Goin' over to Tilly's for a cup
of java. You can handle things.

87
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:55,717
It's a quiet day.

88
00:06:55,717 --> 00:06:57,945
It's been a quiet day in this burg
for the last 50 years.

89
00:07:02,607 --> 00:07:03,615
For you?

90
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,653
- Good night shirt!
- What's the word?

91
00:07:15,653 --> 00:07:19,132
Go get the Sheriff. Tell him to get
over here fast, it's an emergency!

92
00:07:29,847 --> 00:07:32,248
Hey! Take it easy Pappy,
25 mile speed limit.

93
00:07:32,248 --> 00:07:35,449
- Where's the Sheriff?
- Try the office... Hey, what the...?

94
00:07:36,945 --> 00:07:39,101
- Where's Tod?
- Catch your breath. He's...

95
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:41,537
It's an emergency! Ed Hawkins
has gotta' see him now!

96
00:07:41,537 --> 00:07:42,581
What happened?

97
00:07:42,581 --> 00:07:45,851
I don't know, something came
over the wire. Ed wouldn't say.

98
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:48,774
Yeah, that's funny.
Well there's Tod now.

99
00:07:51,522 --> 00:07:55,209
It's an emergency. Ed Hawkins
has gotta' see you right away!

100
00:08:32,157 --> 00:08:34,906
- Hello Ed.
- Thanks, get outta' here.

101
00:08:35,323 --> 00:08:37,202
Wait a second.
I wanna' know what it's about.

102
00:08:37,202 --> 00:08:38,767
It's top secret,
get outta' here.

103
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:41,654
- For Pete's sake, I ran my pants off...
- Blow.

104
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,429
Aw shucks.

105
00:08:46,004 --> 00:08:47,013
What's the word?

106
00:08:47,013 --> 00:08:49,239
Listen to this.
I haven't finished typing it yet...

107
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:53,936
Sheriff Tod Shaw, Suddenly, California.
<Confidential code: 'Hangover'. >

108
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:59,085
<Special train number 10.19 carrying>
<the President of the United States>

109
00:08:59,085 --> 00:09:01,868
<will arrive Suddenly 5pm today. >

110
00:09:02,146 --> 00:09:05,556
<President will detrain and>
<drive to White Springs Ranch. >

111
00:09:05,556 --> 00:09:10,357
<Will require adequate transportation. >
<Appreciate cooperation your staff. >

112
00:09:10,357 --> 00:09:14,602
<With secret service operators>
<arriving 1:15pm. >

113
00:09:14,602 --> 00:09:17,036
<Carney acting chief U.S. >
<Secret Service. >

114
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:20,516
- No mistakes, huh?
- Only in typing.

115
00:09:21,351 --> 00:09:25,699
5pm.
Now, can I use your phone?

116
00:09:26,117 --> 00:09:27,230
Help yourself.

117
00:09:27,648 --> 00:09:30,327
Give me State Police Headquarters
in Wetherby.

118
00:09:30,675 --> 00:09:32,936
- What's that code word again?
- 'Hangover'.

119
00:09:33,214 --> 00:09:34,084
'Hangover'...

120
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:39,547
Hello, this is Tod Shaw at Suddenly.
I wanna' speak to Captain Aaron.

121
00:09:40,138 --> 00:09:42,468
There's number 20.
The 66th crossing.

122
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:47,235
Hello Captain Aaron, this is Tod Shaw.
I've got a message here;

123
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:51,062
the code word is 'Hangover'.
I'm gonna' need five of your cars,

124
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:54,506
two men and one Thompson gun
to each car, and...

125
00:09:56,211 --> 00:09:59,725
Oh, you did?
Swell. Right, thanks.

126
00:10:01,255 --> 00:10:04,038
They got the same message. Aaron
has the show on the road already.

127
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:06,474
Gee!
Those state cops don't fool around!

128
00:10:06,474 --> 00:10:10,092
No, they don't.
Say, you didn't spill this, did you?

129
00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:12,249
It says confidential.

130
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:16,946
Let's keep it that way. I'll run over to
Kaplan's garage. Back in a minute.

131
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:29,679
- Hello Sheriff, be right with you.
- That's not soon enough, lz.

132
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,428
- So?
- I want the black Cadillac at 4:30pm.

133
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:35,315
- The limousine?
- Park it at the station, backed in.

134
00:10:35,942 --> 00:10:37,925
Somebody getting married,
like the sheriff?

135
00:10:37,925 --> 00:10:41,056
Don't be funny, police business.
Don't tell anyone.

136
00:10:41,335 --> 00:10:42,204
I don't get it.

137
00:10:42,204 --> 00:10:45,683
You're not supposed to.
4:30pm. No slip ups.

138
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,272
- Mr. Carney?
- That's right.

139
00:11:17,272 --> 00:11:19,674
- My name's Shaw.
- Get my message?

140
00:11:19,882 --> 00:11:22,317
- What message?
- 'Hangover'.

141
00:11:23,605 --> 00:11:25,100
May I see
your credentials?

142
00:11:28,997 --> 00:11:30,040
This is Wilson.

143
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,285
- Hi.
- Haggerty, Schultz and Kelly.

144
00:11:34,668 --> 00:11:37,764
Glad to make your acquaintance.
I got your message.

145
00:11:38,286 --> 00:11:39,747
You're a careful man,
sheriff.

146
00:11:39,747 --> 00:11:42,183
Not always. This seemed
like a good time to be.

147
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:46,010
We always have to be.
May I see your credentials?

148
00:11:47,018 --> 00:11:51,472
I got a limousine ordered for 4:30.
It'll be parked right here.

149
00:11:51,472 --> 00:11:52,559
Good.

150
00:11:53,594 --> 00:11:56,134
State police have five cars
on the road from Wetherby.

151
00:11:56,134 --> 00:11:58,256
- Excellent.
- I guess that's about it.

152
00:11:58,568 --> 00:11:59,299
Not quite...

153
00:12:00,483 --> 00:12:02,292
You can still be
of help to us...

154
00:12:04,727 --> 00:12:07,405
We'll have to check those
stores facing the station.

155
00:12:07,892 --> 00:12:11,232
Mr Carney, I know every
proprietor here. Believe me.

156
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:15,686
Look, I'm sure they're OK.
It's just routine.

157
00:12:15,686 --> 00:12:17,669
Alright boys...

158
00:12:19,617 --> 00:12:22,540
We'll park a limousine between
the tracks when the special arrives.

159
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,175
Pretty rough in there.

160
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:28,210
Maybe, easier to cover.
All state police cars can go in there too.

161
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,428
Alright.

162
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:32,525
Oh, er...
Who lives up there on the hill?

163
00:12:33,951 --> 00:12:36,699
Pop Benson. His grandson
and his daughter- in-law.

164
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,299
We'll check it.

165
00:12:38,718 --> 00:12:43,031
Ha ha, Mr. Carney that's the one place
in this town that doesn't need checking.

166
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:47,206
Pop Benson used to be in the Secret
Service before a bad ticker retired him.

167
00:12:47,624 --> 00:12:50,302
Pop Benson!
You don't mean Peter Benson?

168
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:54,165
- That's right.
- Well I'll be a monkey's uncle.

169
00:12:54,894 --> 00:12:56,217
What do you mean?

170
00:12:57,609 --> 00:12:59,869
Pete Benson used
to be my old boss.

171
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:02,375
No, how do you like that?

172
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:08,115
Mr Shaw, he'll be the last one
in the world to object... Pete Benson.

173
00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:16,813
Probably a rectifier
or a tube.

174
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,675
Please call Jud, and ask him to fix it
before you wreck it?

175
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:25,858
Wreck it! Now you listen here,
I built a television transmitter in '38,

176
00:13:25,858 --> 00:13:27,667
before you even knew
what television was.

177
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,233
Yes, but did it work?

178
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:31,598
I don't know,
I never finished the receiver.

179
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,313
Well, this is one,
and I wish you'd call Jud.

180
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,096
I don't wanna'.
Besides it costs more on Saturdays.

181
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:39,949
It's cheaper than what it'd cost,
when you're finished with it.

182
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:44,193
Stop taking it out on me,
just 'cos you and Tod had a fight!

183
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:49,029
- You haven't touched your cake.
- Don't want it.

184
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,846
Pidge darling,
I made it especially for you.

185
00:13:51,846 --> 00:13:54,178
You made it because you
wouldn't let me wear my gun.

186
00:13:55,326 --> 00:13:56,334
Drink your milk, darling.

187
00:13:56,334 --> 00:13:58,561
- Sissy.
- What?

188
00:13:58,561 --> 00:14:00,718
That's what the guys call me.

189
00:14:00,996 --> 00:14:04,997
I don't care what they call you, I'm
your mother and I know what's best for you.

190
00:14:06,806 --> 00:14:13,347
Pidge! Pidge, you shouldn't
walk out when I'm talking to you.

191
00:14:13,347 --> 00:14:14,808
I thought you
were finished.

192
00:14:15,017 --> 00:14:17,418
The boy's just
disappointed, that's all.

193
00:14:17,765 --> 00:14:19,818
Dad, please stop interfering.

194
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:25,072
First you take him out of the
Highcliff Cub Scouts, and then...

195
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,672
Pidge, go to your room.

196
00:14:27,194 --> 00:14:31,090
I'll have this old set perkin' in a minute
son; then we'll watch the ball game.

197
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,013
Dad, I've had this
for the last time.

198
00:14:34,013 --> 00:14:38,187
Ellen, you're a grown-up girl. You got a
problem you haven't worked out.

199
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:41,214
That's no reason why Pidge
should have your problem.

200
00:14:41,562 --> 00:14:44,171
I've only done
what I thought was right.

201
00:14:45,493 --> 00:14:49,599
I read about an experiment once.
Kept germs away from a kid.

202
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,834
Raised him pure and scientifically.
First time he went out,

203
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:55,026
he caught cold
and died of pneumonia.

204
00:14:55,026 --> 00:14:56,591
What has that to do with Pidge?

205
00:14:56,591 --> 00:14:59,584
The kid hadn't been exposed,
he had no immunity.

206
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:03,898
There's cruelty, hatred and tyranny
in the world. You can't ignore it.

207
00:15:03,898 --> 00:15:07,655
Pidge's gonna' learn about
the law, so's he can defend it.

208
00:15:07,968 --> 00:15:12,630
Defend it? So he can become a soldier
and be murdered like his father?

209
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,022
My son was killed in the
performance of his duty, Ellen.

210
00:15:18,022 --> 00:15:21,711
Duty, being blown to bits on
some god-forsaken battlefield,

211
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:24,981
thousand of miles from where
he was born. You call that duty?

212
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:26,373
Yes Ellen.

213
00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:29,468
Well, is that what you'd like for Pidge?
Would that make you happy?

214
00:15:29,712 --> 00:15:33,226
If Pete could hear you now,
he'd be ashamed of you.

215
00:15:35,104 --> 00:15:37,819
How can you say
a terrible thing like that?

216
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:42,724
The old boys wrote the words: 'Life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'

217
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:46,133
They sounded mighty nice, but they
wouldn't have been worth a nickel,

218
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:48,812
if somebody hadn't
made 'em stick.

219
00:15:51,456 --> 00:15:54,935
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Look out the window! Golly!

220
00:15:54,935 --> 00:15:56,918
What is it?

221
00:15:56,918 --> 00:16:02,241
Coming down from Wetherby,
a whole lot of state troopers, see 'em?

222
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:17,480
Sure cut it fine.

223
00:16:17,862 --> 00:16:20,854
You couldn't possibly be surprised
with those sirens blasting.

224
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:25,099
- So I tried to beat 'em.
- State troopers, right on time.

225
00:16:25,516 --> 00:16:26,664
Oh, they're good.

226
00:16:26,664 --> 00:16:29,726
- The best, alright Bart, follow me.
- Ok.

227
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:34,318
There are two routes
to the White Springs Ranch:

228
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:37,658
Over the mountains, or you
can go down to the main highway,

229
00:16:37,658 --> 00:16:40,859
go into Three Rivers, the ranch
is about 20 miles further out.

230
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:42,876
We'll stick to the main highway.

231
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,251
Too much chance for an ambush
in those mountains. Yes Haggerty?

232
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:49,522
We could use a roof watch on those
stores Chief, and a street check.

233
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:53,801
Mr. Carney, every proprietor in this
town has been here at least five years.

234
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:55,401
I know them, I know their kids.

235
00:16:55,401 --> 00:17:00,098
It's not that sheriff; it's the stranger that
might use one of those stores for cover.

236
00:17:00,724 --> 00:17:04,760
I'd like them to lock up at 4:50,
stay locked up until 5:10.

237
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,352
- Oh, and put a man on the roof too.
- Alright Bert, give 'em the word.

238
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:13,492
No one is to remain in
those stores at locking time,

239
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:17,493
anyone seen inside after 4:50,
might be shot on sight.

240
00:17:18,015 --> 00:17:21,285
- Like the man says it's important.
- Yes Sir.

241
00:17:22,051 --> 00:17:25,460
Tell Wilson to keep the station clear.
Schultz will take over troopers

242
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,721
and block off traffic approaches
from 4:30 onwards.

243
00:17:27,931 --> 00:17:30,365
Right. There's another hazard Sir.
A house up on the hill.

244
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:34,332
Yeah, I know.
I'll check that one myself.

245
00:17:34,645 --> 00:17:35,654
Yes Sir.

246
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,290
Tod, what the Hades
is going on in this burg?

247
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,446
Did some Galoot make
a uranium strike?

248
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,178
Not exactly. Now look Slim you take
over here and we'll catch up later.

249
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:52,249
Keep all pedestrian traffic off
the main street from 4:30

250
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:54,754
between Oak and Alder,
the state boys will help 'ya,

251
00:17:54,754 --> 00:17:57,885
if anybody in town squawks,
why you smooth things over.

252
00:17:57,885 --> 00:18:00,528
They know you, and this is
going to seem strange to them.

253
00:18:00,528 --> 00:18:04,391
I'm confused myself, never have seen
so many cops. What goes on?

254
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:09,470
This is Mr Carney, special agent of the
Treasury Department, Secret Service.

255
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:12,357
Mr Carney, Slim Adams,
one of my deputies.

256
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:16,462
How do you do?
Secret Service. I get it.

257
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:19,698
They're shipping the national
debt through here in gold bars.

258
00:18:19,976 --> 00:18:23,073
Just don't worry about it,
you'll find out later.

259
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:26,343
Right come on.
Let's go and check that car you hired.

260
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,321
Bang, bang got 'em all.

261
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:46,314
Buffalo Bill, you'd better put that gun
away before your Mom sees it,

262
00:18:46,314 --> 00:18:47,879
she'll tan you a hide.

263
00:18:52,401 --> 00:18:55,811
Dad! I do wish you'd call Jud
and let him come up and fix that.

264
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:59,046
Shucks, Ellen, I knew Ohms Law
before they even passed it.

265
00:18:59,046 --> 00:19:02,873
Don't want Pidge to miss the ball
game, after missing the movie and all.

266
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:05,065
Alright, boy,
get ready to plug this set in

267
00:19:05,065 --> 00:19:07,848
while I hold this screw down
and see what happens.

268
00:19:07,848 --> 00:19:08,823
Okay.

269
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,153
Dad, are you sure you
know what you're doing?

270
00:19:11,153 --> 00:19:12,371
Ellen, please.

271
00:19:12,371 --> 00:19:16,337
But it says on the back that there's
5000 volts, and that's dangerous.

272
00:19:16,337 --> 00:19:23,191
Ellen, please stop being a woman...
Ready boy, plug in.

273
00:19:26,913 --> 00:19:28,966
Dad! Dad! Are you alright?

274
00:19:28,966 --> 00:19:32,445
I guess I'm alright, it scared
the pants of me, that's all.

275
00:19:32,445 --> 00:19:34,115
Golly, look at this.

276
00:19:34,115 --> 00:19:36,272
I guess maybe
you'd better call Jud, huh?

277
00:19:36,272 --> 00:19:37,768
Honestly.

278
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:42,534
- That was a close call, boy.
- How much is 5000 volts?

279
00:19:42,534 --> 00:19:44,448
- Enough.
- It would kill you?

280
00:19:44,656 --> 00:19:47,335
It would probably pick you up
and toss you across the room.

281
00:19:47,335 --> 00:19:50,362
Unless you were standing in a puddle
of water, then you'd be grounded.

282
00:19:50,362 --> 00:19:52,902
And if you were grounded, it'd
kill you deader than a doornail.

283
00:19:52,902 --> 00:19:54,398
Would it hurt?

284
00:19:54,398 --> 00:19:58,155
Like blazes. You stay away from that
set now, and from those wall plugs.

285
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:01,530
Don't monkey with electricity unless
you know what you're doing.

286
00:20:01,878 --> 00:20:05,462
- Why did you, Grandpa?
- You got me there, boy.

287
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:10,228
I'll get it. Jud says he'll be up
in a little while.

288
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:13,080
- I'm sorry.
- Honestly...

289
00:20:15,377 --> 00:20:17,151
- Yes?
- Mrs Benson?

290
00:20:17,151 --> 00:20:19,100
- That's right.
- Is your husband at home?

291
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,360
My hus...
No I'm a widow.

292
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:24,387
What I should have asked was,
are you the owner of this house?

293
00:20:24,387 --> 00:20:27,831
No I'm not. It belongs to my
father-in-law. What is it you want?

294
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,520
I'm John Baron, special agent,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

295
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,537
These are my men.

296
00:20:33,537 --> 00:20:36,216
Do you suppose I could have
a few words with Mr. Benson?

297
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:39,800
Just a moment,
won't you come in? Dad!

298
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,949
- Oh, how are you gents?
- John Baron, special agent.

299
00:20:46,061 --> 00:20:48,671
- For heavens' sake. FBI?
- May we come in?

300
00:20:48,671 --> 00:20:52,602
Why sure, come right in and
make yourselves at home.

301
00:20:52,602 --> 00:20:54,133
- Thanks.
- Not at all.

302
00:20:54,133 --> 00:20:56,778
I get quite a kick out of this, used to be
with the Treasury Department myself.

303
00:20:56,778 --> 00:20:57,577
Really?

304
00:20:57,577 --> 00:21:00,535
- Back in the old days.
- Collector of Internal Revenue, eh.

305
00:21:00,535 --> 00:21:03,179
Tax Collector, not on your life.
Secret Service.

306
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,361
You don't say?

307
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:06,623
Grandpa was President
Coolidge's bodyguard.

308
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:07,980
You don't say?

309
00:21:08,188 --> 00:21:12,503
Yep, back in 1928. Youngest retirement
in the service, account of my heart.

310
00:21:12,503 --> 00:21:15,669
Not heart trouble you understand,
an accident on one of Cal's fishing trips.

311
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:20,574
- A hunter, got the slug right here.
- Say, that's a nasty one.

312
00:21:21,096 --> 00:21:22,383
How come you're still alive?

313
00:21:22,383 --> 00:21:25,236
I don't know, lodged in my heart.
They took it out. Had to take it easy,

314
00:21:25,236 --> 00:21:26,697
so they retired me.

315
00:21:26,697 --> 00:21:29,237
- You're lucky.
- Luckier still if it hadn't hit me.

316
00:21:29,237 --> 00:21:31,603
I'm gonna' be in the
Secret Service someday.

317
00:21:31,603 --> 00:21:33,655
Thought you was gonna'
be a Sheriff, like Tod.

318
00:21:33,655 --> 00:21:36,125
Squirts like you are supposed
to grow up to be President.

319
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,491
- Name's Pidge, Mr Baron.
- Glad to meet you, Pidge.

320
00:21:38,491 --> 00:21:39,674
I ain't a squirt!

321
00:21:40,161 --> 00:21:43,640
Mr Baron, what did you want to
see us about, is something wrong?

322
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,771
Nothing wrong yet Mrs Benson, but
there might be. We're just checking.

323
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:48,023
On us?

324
00:21:48,023 --> 00:21:50,250
On the house.
Do you mind if we a look around?

325
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,676
Help yourself,
but I wanna' know...

326
00:21:51,676 --> 00:21:54,912
We're gonna' look around, with or
without your permission, Mr Benson.

327
00:21:54,912 --> 00:21:57,417
It's an emergency.
Check it.

328
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:07,888
There must be
something the matter.

329
00:22:07,888 --> 00:22:09,907
Anyone else live here,
besides you three?

330
00:22:10,116 --> 00:22:14,291
- No.
- Anyone been by here today?

331
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,439
No.

332
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:17,421
Just the usual routine.
Willy Harris left the milk.

333
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:22,049
- What's this all about Mr Baron?
- Just being careful, I'll explain later.

334
00:22:24,171 --> 00:22:29,077
- Two bedrooms, one bathroom, clear.
- One here, just like they said.

335
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:36,313
Kitchen, pantry, back door, stairs go
down to the garage under kitchen,

336
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,513
cellar door in hall, clear.
Car in the garage.

337
00:22:41,218 --> 00:22:44,071
Look at this for a setup...

338
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,846
Sorry folks, but I'm afraid we're gonna'
have to hang around for a while.

339
00:22:49,846 --> 00:22:51,203
- Why?
- What's the matter?

340
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,742
- Don't be alarmed, nothing's wrong.
- Of course there is.

341
00:22:53,742 --> 00:22:55,726
The FBI
doesn't pay us a visit for nothing.

342
00:22:55,726 --> 00:23:00,422
- I won't stay. I'll take Pidge and go.
- No Ma'am, nobody leaves until we do.

343
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:02,162
Why not?
What's happened?

344
00:23:02,162 --> 00:23:05,571
Look just go about your business, like
it was any other Saturday afternoon.

345
00:23:05,571 --> 00:23:10,442
Read your papers, watch TV,
anything, but nobody leaves the house.

346
00:23:13,122 --> 00:23:16,356
- Something fishy about all this.
- It's official business.

347
00:23:16,844 --> 00:23:18,201
What sort of official business?

348
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:21,888
Mr Benson, as a former agent of the
Secret Service, you should understand.

349
00:23:21,888 --> 00:23:24,254
Either I'm getting old
and stupid, or else I'm...

350
00:23:24,254 --> 00:23:28,603
At 5pm, the President
will arrive in town on a special...

351
00:23:28,603 --> 00:23:30,621
- What?
- Golly!

352
00:23:30,621 --> 00:23:34,100
The President,
well that's different.

353
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,300
You mean the President's
gonna' get off the train here?

354
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,240
That's right.

355
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,119
Gramps,
we gotta' see it.

356
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,866
That's the greatest thing ever
to happen to this town.

357
00:23:42,866 --> 00:23:45,024
Can we go down
and see it Gramps? Can we?

358
00:23:45,232 --> 00:23:50,417
Sorry kid, no! Benny, bring in
the gear. Put the car out back.

359
00:23:50,973 --> 00:23:54,591
Bart, you see the back door's
locked tight and check the cellar.

360
00:23:56,957 --> 00:23:58,836
I still don't understand.

361
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:04,159
Mr Benson, if anyone wanted to kill the
President, he could do a beautiful job,

362
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,559
right from this window of yours.

363
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,934
For the love of Mike, that may be true,
but you don't think that Ellie and me...

364
00:24:09,934 --> 00:24:12,195
Of course not,
but we have to remain here

365
00:24:12,195 --> 00:24:15,152
to protect you and the President,
from someone who might.

366
00:24:15,152 --> 00:24:15,805
Oh.

367
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,731
- Carney?
- Yeah.

368
00:24:33,731 --> 00:24:39,401
Is all this checking routine?
Looks like you expect this town to...

369
00:24:39,401 --> 00:24:43,437
Sheriff, have you noticed any strangers
in town during the past week.

370
00:24:44,029 --> 00:24:45,838
- No.
- Are you sure?

371
00:24:45,838 --> 00:24:50,674
Yes I'm sure. I know everybody here.
The only strangers we get are tourists.

372
00:24:50,674 --> 00:24:54,118
We get 'em all the time, stopping
for gas, a bite to eat. That's all.

373
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:58,884
We wanna' know from you
or your deputies, if any stranger stays!

374
00:24:59,371 --> 00:25:02,329
- Then this isn't routine.
- No it isn't.

375
00:25:03,164 --> 00:25:04,172
Can you tell me?

376
00:25:04,172 --> 00:25:08,034
The LA police picked up a small-time
stool pigeon night before last,

377
00:25:08,034 --> 00:25:09,739
shot through the lungs
and left for dead.

378
00:25:09,739 --> 00:25:13,218
Smiley Bitters. Before he died,
he told them something was up.

379
00:25:13,218 --> 00:25:15,584
What do you mean,
something was up?

380
00:25:15,584 --> 00:25:19,062
- An assassination attempt.
- Well, can you believe that?

381
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:23,760
- In our business we can't afford not to.
- I mean the tip of a dying stool pigeon.

382
00:25:24,037 --> 00:25:27,551
The Stoolie seemed very proud of being
an American, before he kicked off.

383
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:31,970
Meaning crime is crime,
but this is something else again.

384
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,519
Right, so we can't take
any chances. Let's go.

385
00:25:40,215 --> 00:25:43,729
Can we see the President,
grandpa? Can we Mom?

386
00:25:43,729 --> 00:25:46,616
No Pidge, we have to stay here.
You can watch him from here.

387
00:25:46,616 --> 00:25:47,973
But I wanna' get up close.

388
00:25:47,973 --> 00:25:50,653
Well, use your telescope boy.
Bring him right up to your eye.

389
00:25:50,653 --> 00:25:53,574
- Aah!
- Sorry Pidge, no dice.

390
00:25:53,783 --> 00:25:56,601
Back door locked. How about the phone
in the kitchen, want me to yank it?

391
00:25:56,601 --> 00:25:59,663
No, we don't change the pattern.
Give Benny a hand.

392
00:26:04,151 --> 00:26:07,595
Mr Baron, I don't understand,
I was in the service myself...

393
00:26:07,595 --> 00:26:09,474
So you told me.

394
00:26:09,474 --> 00:26:13,301
Though we made every precautionary
check, we never went to extremes...

395
00:26:13,301 --> 00:26:15,875
...unless you were tipped
about an assassination attempt.

396
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:18,033
- You don't mean it?
- I mean it.

397
00:26:18,033 --> 00:26:21,581
But you're FBI Secret Service
is responsible for the President.

398
00:26:21,964 --> 00:26:25,825
We're using everybody this trip,
Mr Benson, have a look down there.

399
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:30,765
State troopers, your local law
enforcement agencies and us.

400
00:26:31,462 --> 00:26:34,349
Do you know if old Dan
Carney is down there?

401
00:26:34,349 --> 00:26:39,290
We worked together in the old days.
He's chief of the presidential staff now.

402
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:43,395
- That's confidential information.
- This is a terrible thing.

403
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:45,482
Not your worry,
Mr Benson.

404
00:26:45,482 --> 00:26:48,961
Of course it's my worry; I'm an
American ain't I? It's everybody's worry.

405
00:26:48,961 --> 00:26:51,779
Car. Somebody's
driving up to the house.

406
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:56,302
- Who is it?
- It's Tod.

407
00:26:56,754 --> 00:26:58,668
He's the Sheriff, Mr Baron.

408
00:26:58,668 --> 00:27:01,034
- There's someone with him.
- Who is it?

409
00:27:01,034 --> 00:27:04,652
- I don't know, never seen him before.
- Well for the love of Mike!

410
00:27:04,652 --> 00:27:05,730
What?

411
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:09,835
It's old Dan Carney, greyer than an old
shirt and redder in the face as ever!

412
00:27:11,575 --> 00:27:12,654
Hi Pop, got an old friend
of yours here.

413
00:27:12,654 --> 00:27:14,149
Hi Pop, got an old friend
of yours here.

414
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:18,254
- Dan, you dirty old Irishman!
- Hello Pop, how are you?

415
00:27:18,254 --> 00:27:21,420
- Hey, why aren't you dead?
- Oh, Buzzards like me live forever!

416
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,229
Hey old Hawkeye,
you're getting bald.

417
00:27:23,229 --> 00:27:25,943
What do you expect
after 25 years?

418
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:28,065
Come on in,
make yourself at home.

419
00:27:28,344 --> 00:27:29,874
This is my daughter-in-law.

420
00:27:29,874 --> 00:27:31,545
- This is my grandson, Pidge.
- Hi 'ya Pidge.

421
00:27:31,545 --> 00:27:34,919
Pidge, this is Mr. Carney, Secret
Service. He guards the President.

422
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,285
- Like Mr Baron.
- Who?

423
00:27:37,285 --> 00:27:40,695
Baron. Oh, you didn't know.
Your boy's got here ahead of you.

424
00:27:46,818 --> 00:27:47,548
Sheriff!

425
00:27:50,783 --> 00:27:52,105
Mom!

426
00:28:00,316 --> 00:28:03,900
One sound from the kid,
Pop, and he's dead.

427
00:28:27,244 --> 00:28:28,635
Train muffled it...

428
00:28:30,654 --> 00:28:34,724
Get rid of him. Put him in the cellar.
And you'd better take the rug with you,

429
00:28:34,724 --> 00:28:36,080
it's a give-away...

430
00:28:41,752 --> 00:28:43,421
You get the message,
brave boy?

431
00:28:43,804 --> 00:28:45,230
Mom! Mom!

432
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,432
Pidge, you've gotta'
be still, no noise.

433
00:28:50,589 --> 00:28:52,675
- You stink!
- Pidge shut up!

434
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:56,189
- Guts.
- He's only eight.

435
00:28:56,816 --> 00:28:58,347
Lots of guts.

436
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,529
Mom.

437
00:29:02,973 --> 00:29:05,027
No trouble with you,
you're all busted up.

438
00:29:13,898 --> 00:29:19,360
Alright, take care of her.
You got it now, let's be practical.

439
00:29:20,995 --> 00:29:23,222
I don't want any more
shooting around here.

440
00:29:23,431 --> 00:29:27,710
I want it nice and quiet and cosy.
Now get her up and bring her around

441
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:31,781
and explain to her that one phoney
and she's got a kid with his throat cut.

442
00:29:32,685 --> 00:29:37,243
Doesn't make much noise that way.
The same goes for you too.

443
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:40,026
Anybody step out of line...
The boy!

444
00:29:41,418 --> 00:29:42,913
That's simple enough.

445
00:29:45,105 --> 00:29:51,994
Ellen, listen to me. Pay attention. Now
listen to me and don't look like that.

446
00:29:51,994 --> 00:29:56,621
Everybody's alright. Get a hold of
yourself. No matter what happens,

447
00:29:56,621 --> 00:29:57,873
you've got to hang on.

448
00:29:58,395 --> 00:30:01,804
If you scream, or make one
false move, he'll murder the boy.

449
00:30:02,048 --> 00:30:04,170
You understand,
he'll murder Pidge.

450
00:30:08,658 --> 00:30:10,571
Do you hear him, Lady?

451
00:30:11,128 --> 00:30:12,694
Yes, yes.

452
00:30:13,877 --> 00:30:17,843
Alright, alright, inside.

453
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,404
We've got a long time to wait.
Relax...

454
00:30:20,296 --> 00:30:22,489
Move the kitchen table
in front of the window.

455
00:30:24,196 --> 00:30:27,679
- Alright, sit down. Look at your TV.
- It ain't workin'.

456
00:30:28,131 --> 00:30:31,892
Well, work him over then. Fix him up.
Don't sit there waiting to blow your cork.

457
00:30:31,892 --> 00:30:34,331
Keep yourselves occupied.
I gotta' think.

458
00:30:44,814 --> 00:30:46,868
Tod, Tod, are you
badly hurt?

459
00:30:46,868 --> 00:30:49,446
The bullet hit the bone,
broke it I guess. He's bled a lot.

460
00:30:49,446 --> 00:30:51,327
We need a doctor,
look at his face.

461
00:30:53,555 --> 00:30:54,704
Tell her Pop.

462
00:30:54,704 --> 00:30:57,212
You're the doctor, Ellen.
We can't have no doctor.

463
00:30:57,212 --> 00:30:58,813
We can't set
a broken arm.

464
00:30:59,615 --> 00:31:00,938
Tough.

465
00:31:01,461 --> 00:31:03,446
- Can you?
- Me?

466
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:07,626
- Straighten this fracture.
- You couldn't take it.

467
00:31:09,018 --> 00:31:13,477
- You straighten it.
- Hold on brave boy...

468
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:25,630
Tie it up.

469
00:31:28,277 --> 00:31:30,331
May we take him
into the bedroom?

470
00:31:30,646 --> 00:31:33,153
Sure,
though the boy stays here...

471
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,437
And leave the door open.

472
00:31:48,546 --> 00:31:50,079
Alright,
let's go to work.

473
00:32:10,313 --> 00:32:12,368
Pop, we gotta'
do something.

474
00:32:12,368 --> 00:32:14,249
Well I know, I know,
but what? What?

475
00:32:14,249 --> 00:32:17,523
- They've got Pidge.
- None of us count. Not even Pidge.

476
00:32:17,523 --> 00:32:20,379
- We haven't got a chance.
- As long as we're alive, we've got one.

477
00:32:20,379 --> 00:32:24,036
- We've got to find a flaw in his plan.
- We'll think of something.

478
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:26,647
Pop, haven't you got a gun?

479
00:32:27,205 --> 00:32:33,439
Gun...
Here in this drawer. My gun.

480
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,727
- Is it loaded?
- No.

481
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:44,444
I hid the cartridges
on account of Pidge.

482
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:48,066
You're a dirty
lousy gangster!

483
00:32:48,588 --> 00:32:50,643
- Why you.
- Leave him alone, Benny.

484
00:32:50,643 --> 00:32:51,793
Did you hear
what he said?

485
00:32:51,793 --> 00:32:54,265
Yeah, I heard. He's been
watching too much television.

486
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:57,156
- He ain't a bad squirt.
- Just tell him to shut up.

487
00:32:57,156 --> 00:32:58,374
Sure, sure.

488
00:33:00,499 --> 00:33:03,494
- This thing's metal.
- Steel top, chrome legs.

489
00:33:05,132 --> 00:33:06,211
I figured wood.

490
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,067
No difference, screw the brackets
to the legs, then to the floor,

491
00:33:09,067 --> 00:33:10,878
that way the table
won't dance.

492
00:33:10,878 --> 00:33:12,794
You're a bunch
of cowards!

493
00:33:14,013 --> 00:33:17,146
You're getting too fresh.
So button it.

494
00:33:20,037 --> 00:33:22,475
Johnny, why all the trouble?
This is a lot of work.

495
00:33:22,475 --> 00:33:23,346
Do it Benny.

496
00:33:23,346 --> 00:33:25,853
- But Johnny, I don't see why we...
- I said just do it, Benny...

497
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:30,450
Once you get the gun anchored,
you've got a solid base.

498
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:32,400
You'll see when
we get to it.

499
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:34,873
This gun's got a heavy recoil
and won't stand still.

500
00:33:37,067 --> 00:33:40,551
We've got just three seconds
to nail the President

501
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,416
and I don't want the table
to shimmy when we get to it.

502
00:33:44,973 --> 00:33:46,714
A tommy gun
would do just as good.

503
00:33:46,714 --> 00:33:51,311
A tommy gun stinks. No accuracy,
no punch. Might as well use a revolver.

504
00:33:52,078 --> 00:33:54,376
This is the gun.

505
00:33:56,048 --> 00:33:58,696
- When I was in the army.
- So I wasn't in the army.

506
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:03,536
Tighter, tighter.
Pop find those cartridges yet?

507
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,033
Not yet.

508
00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:08,098
This is quite a gun, Benny.
Quite a gun.

509
00:34:08,307 --> 00:34:13,078
I did a lot of choppin' in the war
with a baby like this, a lot of choppin'.

510
00:34:16,595 --> 00:34:19,521
You're wrong about me Pidge,
bein' a coward.

511
00:34:20,671 --> 00:34:26,382
Last war, I got a Silver Star,
north of Casino, pocket of resistance.

512
00:34:28,123 --> 00:34:33,591
I killed 27 men, all by myself.
I won a Silver Star medal.

513
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:35,889
Ah, you stole it.

514
00:34:40,035 --> 00:34:43,412
- They're hurting Pidge.
- Alright, take it easy.

515
00:34:43,622 --> 00:34:50,657
Johnny, take it easy, relax, for the love
of Mike. What's a Silver Star?

516
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:59,189
- I won it.
- OK Johnny, OK, you won it.

517
00:35:05,945 --> 00:35:07,130
I got 'em.

518
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:12,424
- They've been in there a long time.
- Yeah, get 'em back in here.

519
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:24,230
What are you all trying to pull?
All of you inside... Come on, come on.

520
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,509
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.

521
00:35:31,509 --> 00:35:34,747
You're lucky, he didn't mean to wing ya,
he meant to blow your brains out.

522
00:35:34,747 --> 00:35:35,931
He's a bad shot.

523
00:35:35,931 --> 00:35:39,310
Yeah, but I'm not, so maybe you'd
better sit down and stay there,

524
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:41,538
that way it'd be safer
for everybody.

525
00:35:41,538 --> 00:35:45,335
You've got that duty look in your eye.
I've seen it up on the line.

526
00:35:45,335 --> 00:35:48,679
- The line? You up on the line?
- Some other time. Down!

527
00:35:56,131 --> 00:35:59,649
Bart, you fool. His car's out front.
Put it in the garage, quick...

528
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:03,340
I have to think
of everything.

529
00:36:03,792 --> 00:36:06,962
- Oh great, just great.
- Might as well advertise.

530
00:36:08,459 --> 00:36:09,749
That was a close one.

531
00:36:16,644 --> 00:36:18,211
Hot in here...

532
00:36:26,813 --> 00:36:28,659
See what time it is?

533
00:36:29,738 --> 00:36:31,550
Alright, suppose you tell me
what happens in this house

534
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,919
on a Saturday afternoon,
between four and five.

535
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,556
Pattern.

536
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:42,764
Smart guy. Sure, and we don't break
that pattern. We're here for a reason

537
00:36:42,764 --> 00:36:45,307
and if we break it, we might
blow the deal, you know?

538
00:36:45,307 --> 00:36:48,267
Mario slings the paper
over the fence, around 4:30.

539
00:36:49,312 --> 00:36:53,629
Delivery boy, does he come in?
Anyone else?

540
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:56,904
Cy Hammel went up the mountain
hunting jack rabbits.

541
00:36:56,904 --> 00:37:00,282
- He'll be by on his way back.
- Will he stop?

542
00:37:00,282 --> 00:37:02,755
Not unless he's got
something to brag about.

543
00:37:03,695 --> 00:37:04,462
Anybody else.

544
00:37:04,462 --> 00:37:05,785
Nobody.

545
00:37:07,526 --> 00:37:10,521
Anybody know that you and
the other guy were coming up here?

546
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:14,630
- That's an interesting question.
- What's the interesting answer?

547
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,825
- You guess.
- Tell him Tod.

548
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:20,970
Sheriff, if you think I have any
qualms about killing this kid,

549
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,676
you couldn't be more wrong.

550
00:37:23,686 --> 00:37:27,098
The thing about killing him,
or you, or her, or him,

551
00:37:27,098 --> 00:37:29,398
is that I wouldn't be getting'
paid for it...

552
00:37:31,243 --> 00:37:33,681
and I don't like giving
anything away for free.

553
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,546
Neither do I,
including information.

554
00:37:38,836 --> 00:37:41,692
Your guts are showing
all over the place, brave boy.

555
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:46,184
No, not me, I'm scared.
You see the way I figure it Baron,

556
00:37:46,184 --> 00:37:50,572
I'm a dead man anyway,
so's the boy, so's Ellen, so's Pop.

557
00:37:50,572 --> 00:37:54,159
Just a question of now or later, and if it
gives the President a bit of an edge,

558
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,691
well then, we get it now.

559
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:57,642
They won't hurt us, they won't hurt.
Pidge, they said so.

560
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:01,473
Because it's convenient Ellen. You think
these crumbs would kill the President

561
00:38:01,473 --> 00:38:03,841
and then take off, leaving us
behind to identify them.

562
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:05,444
You said
you wouldn't hurt Pidge.

563
00:38:05,444 --> 00:38:07,638
Sure, sure, and I meant it.

564
00:38:07,638 --> 00:38:11,816
Don't listen to this guy, he's just
being brave with your kid's life.

565
00:38:11,816 --> 00:38:16,170
I knew guys like that in the army.
We're just doing a job that's all,

566
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,330
identifying us is not involved.

567
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,921
By 7 o'clock tonight, we'll be out of the
country and you'll never see us again.

568
00:38:21,687 --> 00:38:22,557
Tell him Tod, tell him.

569
00:38:22,557 --> 00:38:25,793
Never mind lady, we'll just assume
that they knew he was coming up here,

570
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:29,932
so that if somebody else checks
on him, you can tell him

571
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:33,828
that the sheriff and his friend were here,
but they had to go someplace else.

572
00:38:33,828 --> 00:38:34,872
That's all.

573
00:38:34,872 --> 00:38:36,577
I have to go
to the bathroom.

574
00:38:40,716 --> 00:38:42,456
Go with him Bart.

575
00:38:44,718 --> 00:38:47,360
- I don't need any help.
- Come on, come on.

576
00:38:48,821 --> 00:38:50,874
Okay,
table's screwed down.

577
00:38:50,874 --> 00:38:54,389
Alright, get the tripod up there, drill
a hole in each leg, bolt it to the table

578
00:38:54,389 --> 00:38:56,892
put it centre
in front of the window...

579
00:38:58,422 --> 00:39:00,371
I thought
I told you to sit down.

580
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,640
Just stretching my legs.
You're a very careful man.

581
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:05,625
That's right.

582
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:07,224
Planned on
everything, huh?

583
00:39:07,224 --> 00:39:10,564
Sheriff, the first man they shoot to the
moon on a rocket will take pains too,

584
00:39:10,564 --> 00:39:13,381
'cos that's never been
done before. Neither has this.

585
00:39:13,381 --> 00:39:15,435
Doesn't that worry you?

586
00:39:15,643 --> 00:39:19,574
Haven't got time to worry, I just make
my plans and carry 'em out.

587
00:39:19,574 --> 00:39:22,530
That's what
John Wilkes Booth thought too.

588
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:26,880
Booth! Ha, I'm no actor
busting my leg on a stage,

589
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,176
so I can yell
"Down with the tyrants!"

590
00:39:29,176 --> 00:39:31,889
If Booth wasn't such a ham,
he might have made it.

591
00:39:32,827 --> 00:39:34,880
He got pretty far
at that, though.

592
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,141
The guy who killed Garfield
didn't make it either.

593
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:41,595
Him! Ha, he didn't plan anything. Just
took a lucky shot, strictly left-handed.

594
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:43,021
Just like McKinley.

595
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,638
And Zangara got the chair
for his try at Roosevelt.

596
00:39:47,995 --> 00:39:51,856
He had to try it in a crowd,
I hate crowds.

597
00:39:52,482 --> 00:39:54,014
So nobody ever made it.

598
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:59,961
Up till here...
I'm just a guy makin' a livin'

599
00:40:01,284 --> 00:40:04,589
and I think you've stretched
long enough. As you were.

600
00:40:09,703 --> 00:40:12,067
- Bart take over Benny's watch.
- Okay.

601
00:40:12,067 --> 00:40:14,642
- Benny?
- Yeah Johnny.

602
00:40:15,721 --> 00:40:18,156
Go down town and see what's
goin' on, especially the station plan.

603
00:40:18,156 --> 00:40:19,791
Leave the car here.

604
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:21,043
Why me?

605
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,826
Because Wheeler can fly
a plane, and you can't.

606
00:40:23,826 --> 00:40:25,322
Oh, but I'm
expendable, huh?

607
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,305
No, I just don't want anything
to happen to Wheeler.

608
00:40:27,305 --> 00:40:28,419
Why can't
I take the car?

609
00:40:28,419 --> 00:40:31,270
Because if they nail you, we need
the car to get to the plane.

610
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:34,577
- The place is crawlin' with cops.
- You're getting' paid, ain't ya?

611
00:40:34,577 --> 00:40:38,020
- Yeah.
- You can't say it ain't enough.

612
00:40:39,272 --> 00:40:40,629
I'll be back.

613
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:45,498
Johnny. Look. Nice and steady
just like you wanted it.

614
00:40:55,134 --> 00:40:56,318
Open the curtain.

615
00:41:02,788 --> 00:41:05,918
Trap.
Big beautiful booby-trap.

616
00:41:07,659 --> 00:41:10,059
You can't do this.
You can't do it.

617
00:41:15,104 --> 00:41:19,312
You're wrong lady...
Take a look...

618
00:41:24,009 --> 00:41:25,817
Go on take a look.

619
00:41:39,384 --> 00:41:42,482
I can do it and
I'm going to do it.

620
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:45,785
But you're an American citizen.

621
00:41:46,028 --> 00:41:50,933
Sure. And at 5:01, I'm gonna' be
a very rich American citizen.

622
00:41:50,933 --> 00:41:53,126
- You'll never get away with it.
- Shut up.

623
00:41:55,909 --> 00:41:58,101
- I got a stomach ache.
- Take a pill.

624
00:41:58,378 --> 00:42:01,091
Maybe the old man's right,
Johnny. It's a terrible thing.

625
00:42:01,091 --> 00:42:03,458
Turn it off, will 'ya.
Just another man, a man.

626
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:04,918
But the president.

627
00:42:07,215 --> 00:42:11,181
Yeah, yeah, I never killed
a president before.

628
00:42:14,694 --> 00:42:16,816
- Who's that?
- It's Jud Kelly.

629
00:42:16,816 --> 00:42:19,355
Ellen sent for him to come
and fix the television,

630
00:42:19,355 --> 00:42:21,060
so the boy could
watch the ball game.

631
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,208
Why didn't you tell me?

632
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:26,173
We simply forgot. He's a harmless boy,
Baron. Don't hurt him.

633
00:42:26,521 --> 00:42:29,236
- OK. But if you cross me.
- He won't, he won't.

634
00:42:31,357 --> 00:42:33,653
Alright Pop,
you've got the ball.

635
00:42:36,644 --> 00:42:38,488
Let him in, but watch it.

636
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,933
Ellen, we got to
keep this man talking.

637
00:42:42,385 --> 00:42:43,289
Why?

638
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:46,907
Because that's his weakness.
Sooner or later he'll drop his guard.

639
00:42:46,907 --> 00:42:49,447
We've gotta' find
a way to get Pop's gun.

640
00:42:50,003 --> 00:42:51,986
- Hi Pop, what's new?
- Hello Jud.

641
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,108
I'd better fix your rig,
before you execute yourself.

642
00:42:54,108 --> 00:42:55,603
Come on in.

643
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:59,743
- Tod, what happened to you?
- Ask him?

644
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:03,431
Same thing that'll happen to you,
unless you do exactly as you're told.

645
00:43:03,431 --> 00:43:07,815
- You're kiddin'. Is that real?
- It's real, alright.

646
00:43:08,162 --> 00:43:09,970
- What's your name?
- Jud Kelly.

647
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:13,207
- What are you doing here?
- I came to fix the television set.

648
00:43:13,207 --> 00:43:15,606
Drop it.
Alright Bart, case him.

649
00:43:16,999 --> 00:43:21,032
I don't have any dough, if that's
what you want. Is this a stick-up?

650
00:43:21,834 --> 00:43:24,025
Yeah, that's right,
it's a stick-up.

651
00:43:24,025 --> 00:43:25,519
You'll never get
away with it.

652
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,582
Go over and sit down, buster.
Take your luggage with you.

653
00:43:28,791 --> 00:43:30,322
You too sit down.

654
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:39,783
I don't dig it. Did they rob the bank?
What's the gun for? What's goin' on?

655
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,906
- Where's your store?
- Main Street.

656
00:43:41,906 --> 00:43:43,158
- Who runs it?
- Just me.

657
00:43:43,158 --> 00:43:45,976
- All alone?
- Do you have to point that gun at me?

658
00:43:45,976 --> 00:43:47,542
- Alone?
- Answer him.

659
00:43:47,889 --> 00:43:48,517
Yeah.

660
00:43:48,933 --> 00:43:52,064
You locked up when you left?
Nobody knows you were comin' here?

661
00:43:52,064 --> 00:43:56,552
That's right. Just a service call.
That gun makes me nervous, Mr.

662
00:43:56,830 --> 00:44:00,552
I'm not gonna' be a hero,
you can put the gun away.

663
00:44:00,552 --> 00:44:06,258
Sure, but I'm telling you, buster, like the
others, one pass and the kid gets it.

664
00:44:09,248 --> 00:44:14,293
That's right, he gets it. So you see
his life depends on you. Got it?

665
00:44:14,293 --> 00:44:15,441
Yeah.

666
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:22,990
- Wilson? Carney back yet?
- No, he's been gone a long time.

667
00:44:38,052 --> 00:44:40,940
Maybe we ought to load the gun now
to be sure, huh?

668
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:43,688
No, that's just
what the sheriff would like.

669
00:44:44,244 --> 00:44:46,124
Forget about me,
I've had it.

670
00:44:46,715 --> 00:44:50,541
Don't con me, sheriff. The minute this
gun was loaded, one of you brave boys

671
00:44:50,541 --> 00:44:54,020
might decide to go for the ride,
just to fire it and if you did,

672
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:57,220
it might alert a few state cops down
there and the game would be over.

673
00:44:58,647 --> 00:45:01,708
- You got any food in the house?
- Course I have.

674
00:45:02,404 --> 00:45:04,282
I'm gonna' grab
a bite, Bart. Watch 'em.

675
00:45:04,282 --> 00:45:07,101
Bring me a little glass of milk will you,
Johnny? My ulcer's murdering me.

676
00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:09,675
Just watch 'em Bart.
Watch 'em.

677
00:45:13,049 --> 00:45:17,572
- I don't dig it, will somebody tell me...
- Sit down, be quiet.

678
00:45:37,852 --> 00:45:40,217
Haven't you any
feelings at all?

679
00:45:40,497 --> 00:45:47,384
No I haven't lady, they were taken out
of me by experts... Feelings are a trap.

680
00:45:47,384 --> 00:45:51,211
Show me a guy with feelings
and I'll show you a sucker.

681
00:45:52,984 --> 00:45:56,080
It's a weakness. Makes you think
of something besides yourself.

682
00:45:57,542 --> 00:46:01,821
If I had any feelings left in me at all,
they'd be for me. Just me.

683
00:46:02,203 --> 00:46:04,812
Don't you ever think
of your mother? Your father?

684
00:46:04,812 --> 00:46:09,299
Think of 'em? I used to
think of them a great deal.

685
00:46:12,918 --> 00:46:19,806
My mother wasn't married. My old man
was a dipso. They left me in a home.

686
00:46:25,546 --> 00:46:28,468
- You stink.
- Johnny!

687
00:46:28,468 --> 00:46:30,416
Pidge! Come back here.

688
00:46:30,799 --> 00:46:32,156
- The kid.
- Hold it.

689
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:33,616
Pidge, Pidge.

690
00:46:33,616 --> 00:46:34,731
Get him.

691
00:46:34,731 --> 00:46:36,434
Stick 'em up,
or I'll blast you.

692
00:46:37,408 --> 00:46:40,436
- Nice going, Bart.
- It's only a cap pistol.

693
00:46:40,436 --> 00:46:43,461
- I gave it to him myself.
- Don't you touch her, don't you.

694
00:46:47,009 --> 00:46:49,931
I oughta' beat his brains out.
The little... What's so funny?

695
00:46:49,931 --> 00:46:52,818
You should've seen
your face, a cap pistol.

696
00:46:52,818 --> 00:46:54,244
Go ahead,
laugh yourself sick.

697
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:57,168
That's a pretty good model,
they make 'em real today, don't they?

698
00:46:57,168 --> 00:46:59,255
Here you are, Pidge,
blow his brains out...

699
00:47:00,959 --> 00:47:04,994
Couple of big, bold, bad men, getting'
scared to death by a six-bit cap pistol.

700
00:47:04,994 --> 00:47:06,769
I oughta' beat that kid.

701
00:47:06,769 --> 00:47:08,647
I'm not sure
that he couldn't take 'ya.

702
00:47:09,204 --> 00:47:12,647
Go put some milk on your ulcer
and bring me a piece of the cake.

703
00:47:12,647 --> 00:47:14,980
I need some milk;
the pain's pretty bad.

704
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,996
Where's Benny?
Why don't we hear from Benny?

705
00:47:19,432 --> 00:47:20,475
Sit.

706
00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:28,127
If this isn't a stick-up,
what is it?

707
00:47:29,033 --> 00:47:31,050
Did you come up here
to fix a television set, junior?

708
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:33,276
- Yeah.
- Well then, fix the television set.

709
00:47:34,113 --> 00:47:35,330
Tod, what's going on?

710
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:37,347
They're planning to assassinate
the President, Jud.

711
00:47:37,834 --> 00:47:38,633
Which president?

712
00:47:39,018 --> 00:47:41,800
The President of the United States.
He arrives here this afternoon.

713
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,086
You're kidding!

714
00:47:44,827 --> 00:47:48,687
No, you're not kidding.
The president?

715
00:47:50,427 --> 00:47:55,610
Kill the president? They can't,
they couldn't do a thing like that.

716
00:47:56,237 --> 00:47:58,776
They're stinking traitors.
They're Benedict Arnolds.

717
00:47:58,776 --> 00:48:01,977
Are you guys crazy?
You can't do a thing like that.

718
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,281
- Sit down, reckless.
- Don't you realise what that means?

719
00:48:05,281 --> 00:48:08,586
That's assassination;
he's your President too.

720
00:48:08,899 --> 00:48:12,238
Make a deal with 'ya boy.
We kill you instead of the President.

721
00:48:12,238 --> 00:48:17,004
That's even steven. Okay with you?
Thought not. Anybody else wanna'

722
00:48:17,004 --> 00:48:18,953
take the heat
off the President?

723
00:48:18,953 --> 00:48:22,431
- How about you sheriff?
- It's a bad joke, Baron.

724
00:48:22,431 --> 00:48:24,067
Anybody else wanna' volunteer?

725
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,257
They're commies;
they're enemy agents.

726
00:48:29,249 --> 00:48:35,130
- Alright, who is behind it Baron?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

727
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:38,957
- What's in it for you?
- You're curious, aren't you sheriff?

728
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,243
While I last.

729
00:48:41,425 --> 00:48:44,801
I like you sheriff. You've got guts.
You must have been a good soldier.

730
00:48:44,801 --> 00:48:45,982
I got by.

731
00:48:46,643 --> 00:48:48,731
- I won a Silver Star.
- That's pretty good.

732
00:48:48,731 --> 00:48:52,349
- Killed 27 Jerries all by myself.
- You're a born killer, that's all.

733
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,637
Yeah.

734
00:48:53,638 --> 00:48:55,274
Some guys liked it. I know a couple.

735
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,123
When you get real good
at something, you're a murderer.

736
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:03,124
Yeah, over there you can knock over
a whole platoon, or a guy invents

737
00:49:03,124 --> 00:49:06,986
a bomb and kills 100000 people, just
like that and maybe gets more medals.

738
00:49:07,265 --> 00:49:09,561
Here you put a slug
in a double-crossing squirt

739
00:49:09,561 --> 00:49:12,379
that isn't even worth burying
and you have to take the gas.

740
00:49:12,589 --> 00:49:16,348
I got no feeling against the President;
I'm just earning a living.

741
00:49:16,348 --> 00:49:17,529
By treason.

742
00:49:17,529 --> 00:49:20,730
Ace shoots craps. Don't give me
that politics jazz, it's not my racket.

743
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:22,818
I don't even know who's paying me
and I don't want to know.

744
00:49:22,818 --> 00:49:24,002
What's the difference?

745
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:26,333
Didn't it occur to you
why they want you to do it?

746
00:49:26,541 --> 00:49:31,065
Yes, but that makes them suckers not
me. I'm the guy, who's gettin' it made.

747
00:49:31,065 --> 00:49:36,355
Listen sheriff, a man can stand only for
so much. Before the war, I drifted

748
00:49:36,355 --> 00:49:42,583
and drifted and ran, always lost
in a big crowd. I hated that crowd.

749
00:49:42,583 --> 00:49:46,548
I used to dream about
the crowd once in a while.

750
00:49:46,548 --> 00:49:52,429
I used to see all those faces scratchin'
and shovin' and bitin' and then the mist

751
00:49:52,429 --> 00:49:56,083
would clear and somehow
all those faces would be me.

752
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:59,040
All me and all nothin'.

753
00:49:59,979 --> 00:50:02,138
But the war changed everything,
eh Baron?

754
00:50:03,702 --> 00:50:07,634
I'm no traitor, sheriff.
I won a Silver Star.

755
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:10,418
And learned how to kill.

756
00:50:11,707 --> 00:50:17,900
Yeah, maybe I did.
Maybe that changed everything.

757
00:50:19,361 --> 00:50:21,623
Maybe people began
to know who I was.

758
00:50:23,363 --> 00:50:26,390
After the show, I hooked up
with an outfit for good dough.

759
00:50:26,702 --> 00:50:30,879
The finger said where and how much
and Johnny Baron did the job.

760
00:50:32,096 --> 00:50:35,298
You think anybody else could handle
it? Like Benny or Wheeler without me?

761
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:36,585
You're talkin' too
much, Johnny.

762
00:50:36,585 --> 00:50:39,786
Nobody else can do this job,
because they've got too much feeling

763
00:50:40,726 --> 00:50:42,570
and feeling's
no good.

764
00:50:44,065 --> 00:50:46,223
I got nothing against
the President, sheriff.

765
00:50:46,572 --> 00:50:50,295
He's just worth half a million
bucks to me, tax- free.

766
00:50:52,277 --> 00:50:54,887
Makin' my own laws
about the taxes too, Pop.

767
00:50:55,688 --> 00:50:57,462
- The guy is goofy.
- Shut up, Jud.

768
00:50:58,923 --> 00:51:03,308
Listen to him, buster. And
don't ever say that again. Ever!

769
00:51:06,509 --> 00:51:13,816
You heard him, Jud.
A half million dollars, huh?

770
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:20,601
Yeah, that's a lot of scratch, sheriff.
A man could retire on that amount.

771
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:23,662
- How do you know it will ever be paid?
- Half of it's been paid.

772
00:51:23,662 --> 00:51:26,516
- And the rest?
- I'll get it.

773
00:51:26,726 --> 00:51:30,935
I wouldn't be sure. It's not just
a man; it's the President.

774
00:51:31,353 --> 00:51:32,919
That's what's so funny.

775
00:51:33,962 --> 00:51:35,808
The laugh is on the guys
who're paying the freight.

776
00:51:35,808 --> 00:51:38,938
All this loot and they don't
even know what they're doing.

777
00:51:39,285 --> 00:51:43,252
Half a million clams for absolutely
nothing, because tonight at 5pm,

778
00:51:43,252 --> 00:51:47,498
I kill the president and at 5:01
there's a new president.

779
00:51:47,498 --> 00:51:53,343
What changes? Nothing.
What are they paying for? Nothing.

780
00:51:54,247 --> 00:51:56,544
Otherwise I wouldn't have
taken the job, sheriff.

781
00:51:56,544 --> 00:51:57,762
You'd have taken it.

782
00:51:59,538 --> 00:52:00,234
You think so?

783
00:52:00,234 --> 00:52:01,381
- Yeah.
- Why?

784
00:52:08,479 --> 00:52:11,054
Alright, take it easy.
Come on, lady.

785
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:17,005
Do as you're told
and everything will be fine.

786
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:20,798
Answer straight,
clean and plain. Answer it.

787
00:52:24,451 --> 00:52:25,496
Hello.

788
00:52:25,774 --> 00:52:28,103
Mrs Benson,
let me speak to the chief.

789
00:52:28,417 --> 00:52:29,461
Benny?

790
00:52:29,461 --> 00:52:31,757
Yeah, train's on time,

791
00:52:32,001 --> 00:52:35,238
the car will be waiting in front of the
station like you figured, facing you.

792
00:52:35,969 --> 00:52:38,195
Fine, get back as soon as you can
and don't be followed.

793
00:52:38,195 --> 00:52:39,100
Check.

794
00:53:03,038 --> 00:53:06,831
There's the big boy's car now.
Lovely target.

795
00:53:07,805 --> 00:53:15,043
- Hey, hold it Mister.
- Yes officer, what is it?

796
00:53:15,043 --> 00:53:18,418
- What's your name?
- Fred, Fred Whitaker.

797
00:53:18,418 --> 00:53:21,550
- What are you doing in town?
- Just passing through.

798
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:22,663
Where's your car?

799
00:53:22,663 --> 00:53:26,108
I don't have one. I hitch-hiked in from
Three Rivers, waiting for the train out.

800
00:53:26,108 --> 00:53:27,778
I figured I'd take
the train on to L.A.

801
00:53:27,778 --> 00:53:30,632
- What train?
- The five o'clock.

802
00:53:30,632 --> 00:53:35,016
- The five o'clock. Now that's strange.
- Why Officer?

803
00:53:35,016 --> 00:53:38,183
Because we don't have any
5pm train that stops here Mister,

804
00:53:38,183 --> 00:53:42,671
except today and that happens to be
a special, you don't know about.

805
00:53:42,671 --> 00:53:48,865
- Except that you do.
- Must be some mistake.

806
00:53:48,865 --> 00:53:50,395
You made it.

807
00:53:51,544 --> 00:53:57,285
Oh, now look officer, I got
identification. I can prove who I am.

808
00:53:57,528 --> 00:54:00,417
I got my drivers
licence right here.

809
00:54:03,897 --> 00:54:04,836
Come on.

810
00:54:13,361 --> 00:54:14,126
Gunfire!

811
00:55:04,545 --> 00:55:05,866
Hold it, don't shoot him...

812
00:55:15,018 --> 00:55:17,279
- I told you not to kill him.
- Not to kill him? After he...

813
00:55:17,279 --> 00:55:19,473
He was our only link.
Come on.

814
00:55:27,266 --> 00:55:30,328
- So long, Benny.
- Do you think they got him?

815
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:31,614
I only hope he's dead.

816
00:55:31,825 --> 00:55:33,390
- Haggerty.
- Yes sir.

817
00:55:33,598 --> 00:55:35,617
We got him.
Dead unfortunately.

818
00:55:36,313 --> 00:55:38,679
Wasn't Carney's last checkpoint
the house on the hill?

819
00:55:38,679 --> 00:55:41,880
Yes, he went there with the sheriff to
check the White Springs ranch about 2.

820
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,063
We haven't been able
to reach them.

821
00:55:43,063 --> 00:55:44,629
Take two troopers
and back track 'em.

822
00:55:44,629 --> 00:55:47,239
Start with the house on the hill.
We've got to find Carney.

823
00:55:47,239 --> 00:55:48,109
Right.

824
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:54,999
Now we got trouble. Everybody
except Mrs Benson, in the cellar.

825
00:55:55,311 --> 00:55:57,991
- What are you gonna' do?
- Nothing, I hope. Move.

826
00:56:00,287 --> 00:56:02,967
Anybody gets brave, kill 'em all.
You can only hang once.

827
00:56:16,467 --> 00:56:17,651
Pidge, stay up there.

828
00:56:21,338 --> 00:56:24,088
Now look. Get a grip on yourself.
I want you to look relaxed.

829
00:56:24,366 --> 00:56:27,149
If you don't pull this off,
everybody is dead. Understand?

830
00:56:27,498 --> 00:56:29,550
All of us dead.
So be yourself.

831
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:30,628
I don't know what you mean.

832
00:56:30,628 --> 00:56:32,786
They'll come up here to check whether
Carney and the sheriff were here

833
00:56:32,786 --> 00:56:35,257
and I want you to go out front.
I don't want 'em in the house.

834
00:56:35,257 --> 00:56:37,449
I can't. I don't know how.
I don't know what to say.

835
00:56:37,692 --> 00:56:40,754
Just go out and water the flowers.
Do anything you like, but keep busy...

836
00:56:42,912 --> 00:56:44,094
Lipstick and rouge, quick.

837
00:56:46,426 --> 00:56:48,375
Now listen to me carefully,

838
00:56:48,792 --> 00:56:51,367
they'll come up to check whether
Carney and the sheriff were here.

839
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:52,828
Certainly they were here.

840
00:56:52,828 --> 00:56:56,203
They came up to check the house,
but at three o'clock they left here.

841
00:56:56,203 --> 00:56:58,465
They went out
on the White Springs ranch road.

842
00:56:58,673 --> 00:57:02,015
They took Pop and the kid with 'em
and that's the last you saw of them.

843
00:57:02,015 --> 00:57:04,310
You got it, you got it?

844
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:05,354
Yes, yes.

845
00:57:06,955 --> 00:57:09,113
You look like a ghost.
Step on it...

846
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:15,097
Pull it off lady,
or everybody is dead, everybody.

847
00:57:23,588 --> 00:57:24,701
He's getting rattled, Pop.

848
00:57:24,701 --> 00:57:25,814
How do you mean?

849
00:57:26,057 --> 00:57:27,624
He didn't expect Benny to get shot.

850
00:57:28,285 --> 00:57:29,468
Got anything in mind?

851
00:57:30,303 --> 00:57:31,835
Maybe, now listen.

852
00:57:31,835 --> 00:57:32,982
Shut up you guys.

853
00:57:36,985 --> 00:57:37,679
Mrs Benson?

854
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:38,793
Yes.

855
00:57:38,793 --> 00:57:40,046
My name's Haggerty.

856
00:57:40,602 --> 00:57:42,516
Then you must be one
of Mr. Carney's men.

857
00:57:42,516 --> 00:57:43,456
That's right, has he been here?

858
00:57:43,908 --> 00:57:45,613
Haven't seen him since they left.

859
00:57:45,613 --> 00:57:47,144
They came up here
about three o'clock,

860
00:57:47,144 --> 00:57:49,892
to check the house, they said.
I - I don't know why.

861
00:57:49,892 --> 00:57:51,634
Who are they?

862
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,790
Why, Mr Carney and Sheriff Shaw.

863
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:55,529
Then they said they had to check
the White Springs ranch road.

864
00:57:55,529 --> 00:57:57,061
Is your father-in-law
Mr. Benson here?

865
00:57:57,061 --> 00:58:01,062
Well no. No he isn't.

866
00:58:02,141 --> 00:58:04,472
You see he used
to be Mr. Carney's chief.

867
00:58:04,472 --> 00:58:05,828
Yes, I know.

868
00:58:06,422 --> 00:58:09,100
So Mr. Carney took him along.
My little boy too.

869
00:58:09,726 --> 00:58:10,700
Then you're alone?

870
00:58:11,432 --> 00:58:12,302
Yes.

871
00:58:13,936 --> 00:58:16,129
And you haven't heard from them
since they left?

872
00:58:16,408 --> 00:58:20,339
No, no I haven't. Something's wrong.
I know something's wrong.

873
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:25,245
No, no Mrs Benson, nothing's wrong.
We're, we're just checking that's all.

874
00:58:26,081 --> 00:58:28,203
But if you see
or hear from them before I do,

875
00:58:28,203 --> 00:58:30,428
please have them check the detail
down at the railroad station,

876
00:58:30,428 --> 00:58:32,238
it's very important. Thanks.

877
00:58:35,509 --> 00:58:37,354
Alright lady, inside...

878
00:58:44,209 --> 00:58:45,113
Come on, come on.

879
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:52,595
Very nice, very nice job.
Congratulations.

880
00:58:55,133 --> 00:58:56,665
You don't like me, do you?

881
00:58:58,823 --> 00:59:02,094
- You're an animal.
- I don't like you either.

882
00:59:02,512 --> 00:59:05,329
Animals kill each other to live,
that's what you're doing.

883
00:59:06,373 --> 00:59:09,645
How do you like your roast beef?
Medium rare or well done?

884
00:59:14,724 --> 00:59:16,881
Alright, Bart, run 'em in.
It's clear.

885
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:25,999
- I wish you were dead.
- You haven't got the guts.

886
00:59:28,016 --> 00:59:32,749
- Just give me a chance.
- Here's your chance.

887
00:59:35,637 --> 00:59:40,474
Go ahead, take it, but remember
the squirt in the cellar...

888
00:59:51,503 --> 00:59:54,949
That's right
think of the President first.

889
00:59:57,174 --> 01:00:01,698
Let's not think of ourselves.
I didn't give you a whole chance,

890
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,795
but you didn't even take
a half a chance.

891
01:00:14,991 --> 01:00:16,381
Everything okay, Johnny?

892
01:00:16,626 --> 01:00:20,384
Sure, everything's fine.
She played her part real good.

893
01:00:20,766 --> 01:00:26,334
She should be on television. You,
didn't I tell you to fix the television set?

894
01:00:26,681 --> 01:00:27,691
You told me to sit.

895
01:00:27,691 --> 01:00:30,509
Get your stuff and fix it.
It'll keep you from getting patriotic.

896
01:00:30,509 --> 01:00:33,153
If I don't do something,
I'll blow my top just sitting here.

897
01:00:33,153 --> 01:00:36,389
Fix the set and shut your mouth.
I don't like what you say.

898
01:00:36,389 --> 01:00:39,208
Now fix it,
we've still got time...

899
01:00:43,905 --> 01:00:44,880
All yours...

900
01:00:52,499 --> 01:00:53,404
Open 'em...

901
01:01:05,513 --> 01:01:08,087
About 200 yards.

902
01:01:10,212 --> 01:01:13,515
- Baron. Isn't that a German rifle?
- Yeah. You know it?

903
01:01:13,515 --> 01:01:16,752
I know it. Where were
you during the war?

904
01:01:17,727 --> 01:01:21,729
All the way from the Kasserine Pass.
I won a Silver Star. Where were you?

905
01:01:21,729 --> 01:01:25,625
Normandy to the Elbe by way of the
Bulge. You get up into Germany?

906
01:01:25,834 --> 01:01:29,836
No. Bet you were one of those big shot
guys with the gold bar on the shoulder.

907
01:01:29,836 --> 01:01:32,305
No, no I was a corporal.
How about you?

908
01:01:32,305 --> 01:01:36,134
- Corporal? I made sergeant.
- You didn't like officers?

909
01:01:36,724 --> 01:01:42,049
Officers, big shots. Yes sir,
no sir, salute sir. Big shots.

910
01:01:42,257 --> 01:01:46,746
- You don't like big shots?
- Not when you're bigger, sheriff.

911
01:01:46,746 --> 01:01:50,295
I killed more Jerries than
any five officers put together.

912
01:01:50,504 --> 01:01:53,775
I did some pretty good chopping
in the war. Pretty good.

913
01:01:53,775 --> 01:01:56,559
Like I said before,
you're a born killer. That's all.

914
01:01:56,871 --> 01:02:01,847
Yeah, they taught me how and I liked it.
Ha, my C.O. Used to stand there

915
01:02:01,847 --> 01:02:03,693
and shake
like a leaf while I chopped.

916
01:02:03,693 --> 01:02:04,909
If more guys like me had to...

917
01:02:04,909 --> 01:02:08,110
Tell me one thing, Baron.
How come you missed Germany?

918
01:02:08,562 --> 01:02:10,477
They sent me home,
my tour was finished.

919
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:13,713
Your tour? In the infantry?
Are you kiddin'?

920
01:02:14,165 --> 01:02:17,018
You finish your tour in the infantry
when they plant you in a box.

921
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:19,942
- Tour! That was for the air corp.
- Turn it off.

922
01:02:19,942 --> 01:02:22,725
- Yeah, you probably went over the hill.
- I said, turn if off.

923
01:02:22,725 --> 01:02:26,448
You know, Baron, you got the yard look.
You look yard bird to me.

924
01:02:26,448 --> 01:02:27,769
I'm tellin' you, sheriff. Turn it off.

925
01:02:27,769 --> 01:02:30,484
Big shot with the yard birds,
eh? Come on now, tell me.

926
01:02:30,484 --> 01:02:34,451
Where were you court-martialled?
What was it for? Rape?

927
01:02:34,659 --> 01:02:37,026
No, not rape. Killing,
that's what you like, killing.

928
01:02:37,026 --> 01:02:39,252
Maybe shooting down
unarmed PW's.

929
01:02:39,252 --> 01:02:41,027
Sit down and shut up.

930
01:02:41,827 --> 01:02:47,393
Ah, but by golly you got away with it.
So... I got it. Section eight.

931
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:50,631
You went out on a section eight.
Section eight.

932
01:02:50,631 --> 01:02:54,701
Psycho in charge of killing, eh?
You know, I knew guys like you.

933
01:02:54,701 --> 01:02:58,042
Killing was sweet.
Rather kill a man than love a girl.

934
01:02:58,286 --> 01:03:01,313
- A real kick. A thrill with the guts.
- Stop it, Tod. Stop it.

935
01:03:01,313 --> 01:03:03,643
Or maybe you didn't like your C.O.
Maybe you shot him in the back.

936
01:03:03,643 --> 01:03:06,219
That it?
Maybe you... Aaagh!

937
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:12,099
Like I said, shut up.

938
01:03:19,406 --> 01:03:25,948
- Tod darling, it's hopeless.
- No, no it's not five o'clock yet.

939
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:29,949
Gonna' keep your trap shut?

940
01:03:29,949 --> 01:03:31,027
Yeah.

941
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:32,455
Hurts, huh?

942
01:03:33,081 --> 01:03:33,916
It hurts.

943
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:36,838
Well I can keep kickin', as long
as you keep shootin' your face off.

944
01:03:36,838 --> 01:03:37,918
I know.

945
01:03:38,266 --> 01:03:42,823
Pop, you were right when you blew
the power tube. I have one here.

946
01:03:43,346 --> 01:03:44,842
I'll have it perkin',
in a second.

947
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:46,930
You know,
I was thinking Jud.

948
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:50,965
If you were to clamp the main plate lead
to a good ground like that table there,

949
01:03:50,965 --> 01:03:53,680
you'd get a better picture.
A lot of lines in it now.

950
01:03:55,071 --> 01:03:59,526
Clamp the main plate lead to the table.
Cut the static lines.

951
01:03:59,804 --> 01:04:03,980
Expert. First he wrecks the set,
then he tells the kid how to fix it.

952
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:05,649
Main plate lead...

953
01:04:12,365 --> 01:04:13,027
Yeah.

954
01:04:16,575 --> 01:04:19,115
That's right, Jud, all it needs
is a high potential ground.

955
01:04:19,115 --> 01:04:21,308
We're a long way from
the broadcasting station.

956
01:04:21,308 --> 01:04:22,699
What are you guys
yapping about?

957
01:04:22,699 --> 01:04:24,925
Technical talk, mister.
I'm an old radio man.

958
01:04:24,925 --> 01:04:26,804
Battleship New York,
World War One.

959
01:04:27,083 --> 01:04:28,859
Gramps beat the Germans,
single-handed.

960
01:04:28,859 --> 01:04:31,189
Not exactly son,
but I was there at Scapa Flow

961
01:04:31,189 --> 01:04:32,686
when the German
fleet surrendered.

962
01:04:32,686 --> 01:04:35,782
Alright, alright, stop the bulling
and fix that set will ya.

963
01:04:36,026 --> 01:04:37,173
Yes sir.

964
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:40,757
- Oh!
- Dad, Dad what is it?

965
01:04:41,001 --> 01:04:42,846
- Pain, bad.
- What hit him?

966
01:04:43,125 --> 01:04:44,376
He has a bad heart.

967
01:04:44,376 --> 01:04:46,151
Pidge, my pills,
top drawer of the bureau.

968
01:04:46,464 --> 01:04:49,735
- I'll get 'em.
- You stay put. The kid'll get 'em.

969
01:05:17,016 --> 01:05:19,242
Pidge, put down that gun and
get some water for your grandfather.

970
01:05:19,242 --> 01:05:20,356
But mom, listen.

971
01:05:20,842 --> 01:05:22,096
You heard me, Pidge.

972
01:05:24,009 --> 01:05:24,662
OK.

973
01:05:30,307 --> 01:05:33,961
You know what I think, Pop. I got a
feeling your heart attack's a phony.

974
01:05:34,238 --> 01:05:35,178
Pain's bad.

975
01:05:35,178 --> 01:05:38,310
I'm warning you, if you're trying to pull
something, you'd better watch it.

976
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:39,492
Baron, I've been thinking.

977
01:05:39,492 --> 01:05:41,755
You've been thinking you'd like
to take a crack at this rifle.

978
01:05:41,755 --> 01:05:43,703
Do you think I'd
wanna' get myself killed?

979
01:05:43,703 --> 01:05:46,904
Yes. Frankly, sheriff I don't think
you'd mind getting yourself killed.

980
01:05:47,428 --> 01:05:48,992
Nobody wants to die.

981
01:05:48,992 --> 01:05:51,010
Do we have to talk about it?
Why don't you shut up?

982
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:54,107
- No guts.
- It gets on my nerves, that's all.

983
01:05:54,107 --> 01:05:56,577
Now why would I want
to get myself killed?

984
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:58,875
Because it's five minutes
to five and a shot might bring

985
01:05:58,875 --> 01:06:02,076
those state troopers stormin' all over
the joint before the President arrives.

986
01:06:02,424 --> 01:06:06,285
Sheriff, I can put you away in two
seconds by twisting your arm again.

987
01:06:06,285 --> 01:06:10,495
That way there's no noise. So don't
go winning any post-mortem medals.

988
01:06:11,330 --> 01:06:13,174
I wouldn't enjoy winning
a post-mortem medal

989
01:06:13,174 --> 01:06:16,133
any more than you're gonna'
enjoy that post-mortem money.

990
01:06:16,133 --> 01:06:17,038
- What did you say?
- What did he say?

991
01:06:17,038 --> 01:06:19,437
I said nobody ever made it.
You won't either.

992
01:06:22,361 --> 01:06:23,649
You don't think so?

993
01:06:25,528 --> 01:06:28,312
So you got a plane. You'll never
reach it ahead of the police

994
01:06:28,312 --> 01:06:30,433
and if you do you'll never
make it to the border.

995
01:06:30,433 --> 01:06:32,417
You ever hear of
the jet fighter?

996
01:06:32,417 --> 01:06:35,061
You know how many airstrips there
are between here and the border?

997
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:38,401
You know a fella' can get an
education just listening to this guy.

998
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:39,863
Well, maybe he's
right, Johnny.

999
01:06:40,072 --> 01:06:42,125
You said half the money
had already been paid.

1000
01:06:42,125 --> 01:06:44,316
A smart guy would hit
the road right now.

1001
01:06:44,316 --> 01:06:47,414
Fly outa here, skip the President,
spend the money in South America.

1002
01:06:47,414 --> 01:06:48,527
Alive.

1003
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:53,816
He's right, Johnny. Why take the risk?
We can lam now, we can make it.

1004
01:06:53,816 --> 01:06:57,608
We don't have to fool with this. It's too
big, there's something wrong with it.

1005
01:06:57,853 --> 01:06:58,756
Chicken.

1006
01:06:58,756 --> 01:07:02,271
Chicken! Alright, fine.
Who wants to be rich and dead?

1007
01:07:02,759 --> 01:07:04,637
They'll get us.
They haven't missed yet, Johnny.

1008
01:07:04,845 --> 01:07:06,377
The guy's right. You've got the loot.

1009
01:07:06,377 --> 01:07:08,779
Let's take off and get outa here for
good. Once we're across the border...

1010
01:07:08,779 --> 01:07:09,821
Hate those craps.

1011
01:07:09,821 --> 01:07:12,118
Benny wasn't chicken, they
didn't waste any time on him.

1012
01:07:12,118 --> 01:07:14,137
We haven't got a chance.

1013
01:07:14,484 --> 01:07:19,983
Turn it off, Bart. You're embarrassing
me in front of the Sheriff.

1014
01:07:20,819 --> 01:07:24,192
But Johnny, even if we swing it, he's the
President. They'll never give up.

1015
01:07:24,436 --> 01:07:27,150
You don't figure that the guys
who're paying off, are just gonna'

1016
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:30,351
let you fly away, do you? They'll be
after you, just like the Secret Service.

1017
01:07:31,743 --> 01:07:33,553
I thought of that too, sheriff.

1018
01:07:34,004 --> 01:07:36,650
It might be an internationally
embarrassing situation,

1019
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:38,981
if the feds happen to
catch up with us first.

1020
01:07:39,433 --> 01:07:42,565
You've gotta' realise Bart that
everybody's gonna' be on your tail;

1021
01:07:42,565 --> 01:07:44,721
from five o'clock
until the day you die.

1022
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:47,889
There's a hole in
your argument, sheriff.

1023
01:07:47,889 --> 01:07:49,002
What is it?

1024
01:07:49,002 --> 01:07:51,750
We're already wanted for murder.
So you can only take the gas once.

1025
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:53,664
They'll get us, Johnny.

1026
01:07:56,136 --> 01:08:00,450
- They won't get us Bart. Not us.
- You're sure, Johnny?

1027
01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:03,442
You leave it to me.

1028
01:08:06,957 --> 01:08:09,008
You're sick, mate.
You're sick.

1029
01:08:09,532 --> 01:08:11,097
I don't like that.

1030
01:08:11,688 --> 01:08:13,915
Don't play God, just
because you've got a gun.

1031
01:08:16,942 --> 01:08:19,170
But you see sheriff
that's the way it is.

1032
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:21,848
When you've got a gun
you are a sort of God.

1033
01:08:22,058 --> 01:08:25,050
If you had the gun, I'd be the
chump and you'd be the God.

1034
01:08:25,886 --> 01:08:28,355
The gun gives you the power
of life and death.

1035
01:08:29,816 --> 01:08:32,428
It's a funny sort of feeling to
have control of life and death.

1036
01:08:32,914 --> 01:08:34,966
You must have had it
during the war.

1037
01:08:35,663 --> 01:08:38,307
You could miss a man
if you had a mind to.

1038
01:08:38,725 --> 01:08:41,230
Or you could kill him
dead in his tracks.

1039
01:08:41,473 --> 01:08:45,440
And that made you a
kinda' God, and I liked it.

1040
01:08:46,484 --> 01:08:51,390
Without the gun I'm nothing, and I
never had anything before I got one.

1041
01:08:52,712 --> 01:08:56,087
First time I got one in my hands and
killed a man, I got some self-respect.

1042
01:08:57,165 --> 01:08:58,627
I was somebody.

1043
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:02,282
Like this kid over here.

1044
01:09:02,282 --> 01:09:05,308
If that cap pistol was a real gun
and I didn't have a gun,

1045
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:08,719
he'd be a kind of a God too
and if I wanted my life,

1046
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:11,329
I'd worship the ground he walks on

1047
01:09:11,329 --> 01:09:14,112
and I'd pay him the half a million
dollars for my life.

1048
01:09:15,643 --> 01:09:17,661
Because life is all I have.

1049
01:09:20,445 --> 01:09:24,237
But the squirt doesn't have the gun,
I have and I can loose the lightening.

1050
01:09:33,457 --> 01:09:35,128
No noise just pictures.

1051
01:09:43,305 --> 01:09:44,524
Oh, butterfingers!

1052
01:09:52,386 --> 01:09:54,649
You're wrong about God
and the gun, sheriff.

1053
01:09:54,649 --> 01:09:57,119
Without the gun you would
never have spit at me.

1054
01:09:57,502 --> 01:09:59,276
You would never
have even noticed me.

1055
01:09:59,867 --> 01:10:03,974
But because of the gun you'll
remember me as long as you live.

1056
01:10:19,145 --> 01:10:20,536
Where is it now?

1057
01:10:20,536 --> 01:10:23,179
Blowing for the 66 crossing,
outside town.

1058
01:10:24,747 --> 01:10:27,877
Alright, nobody moves.
This is it. You, over there.

1059
01:10:28,921 --> 01:10:30,418
Johnny,
let me see, once.

1060
01:10:30,661 --> 01:10:33,271
We're gonna' do it, Bart.
This is my meat. We're gonna' do it.

1061
01:10:33,514 --> 01:10:34,350
Just to see.

1062
01:10:40,892 --> 01:10:42,005
Return Fire.

1063
01:11:19,479 --> 01:11:20,664
Hold your Fire.

1064
01:12:07,288 --> 01:12:08,821
It didn't stop.

1065
01:12:15,465 --> 01:12:16,857
It didn't stop.

1066
01:12:17,973 --> 01:12:19,050
It didn't stop!

1067
01:12:32,307 --> 01:12:35,231
No... Don't.

1068
01:12:36,621 --> 01:12:40,310
No! Please, no!

1069
01:12:52,174 --> 01:12:53,914
Are you sure you're going
to be alright, Mr. Benson?

1070
01:12:53,914 --> 01:12:56,454
Oh! Don't worry about me
Mr. Wilson, I'll be alright.

1071
01:12:56,454 --> 01:12:57,952
I don't need any nurse maid.

1072
01:12:58,856 --> 01:13:00,318
We're certainly
grateful to you.

1073
01:13:00,318 --> 01:13:02,161
How come the train went
right through the station?

1074
01:13:02,161 --> 01:13:04,075
We simply cancelled
the stopover.

1075
01:13:04,492 --> 01:13:06,301
We couldn't take a chance
on the President's safety

1076
01:13:06,301 --> 01:13:08,704
once it were proven the
assassins were in town.

1077
01:13:08,704 --> 01:13:10,407
The President went on to
Los Angeles.

1078
01:13:10,407 --> 01:13:11,417
Missed the station, huh?

1079
01:13:11,417 --> 01:13:12,428
I'm afraid so.

1080
01:13:12,428 --> 01:13:15,488
Some day those guys are gonna' start
taking you for amateurs, Mr. Wilson?

1081
01:13:15,731 --> 01:13:18,098
I hope not. Thanks again,
Mr. Benson.

1082
01:13:18,098 --> 01:13:20,360
You too, young man.

1083
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:24,918
Oh, that's alright. Someday I'm
gonna' be a bodyguard, just like you.

1084
01:13:24,918 --> 01:13:27,144
Nonsense boy. You're gonna'
grow up to be President

1085
01:13:27,144 --> 01:13:28,711
and president's
have bodyguards.

1086
01:13:28,711 --> 01:13:29,858
And grandpops?

1087
01:13:29,858 --> 01:13:32,225
And grandpops.
Especially grandpops.

1088
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:48,335
Ellen.

1089
01:13:49,483 --> 01:13:50,560
How's Jud?

1090
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:52,754
He didn't make it.

1091
01:13:54,529 --> 01:13:55,538
And Slim?

1092
01:13:55,538 --> 01:13:57,591
Critical, but they
think he'll be alright.

1093
01:13:59,366 --> 01:14:01,349
I guess somebody had
to make them stick.

1094
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:02,810
What?

1095
01:14:03,575 --> 01:14:06,498
Something dad said this morning,
about principles.

1096
01:14:07,369 --> 01:14:09,594
Get in Tod;
I'll drive you home.

1097
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:13,179
No thanks; I've got
to go over to the office.

1098
01:14:15,823 --> 01:14:17,876
Can I pick you up
for church tomorrow?

1099
01:14:23,583 --> 01:14:25,601
Yeah, that'll be swell.

1100
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:41,188
Say officer.

1101
01:14:41,188 --> 01:14:41,955
Yeah.

1102
01:14:41,955 --> 01:14:43,521
Could you tell me the way
to Three Rivers?

1103
01:14:44,041 --> 01:14:48,148
Ah, you go down to the first intersection,
you turn left, it's about 60 miles.

1104
01:14:48,357 --> 01:14:49,958
Thanks.
What's this town?

1105
01:14:49,958 --> 01:14:50,967
"Suddenly".

1106
01:14:51,383 --> 01:14:52,393
Suddenly, what?

1107
01:14:52,881 --> 01:14:54,133
No that's the name.

1108
01:14:54,828 --> 01:14:56,325
That's a funny name
for a town.

1109
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:04,083
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know about that.

1110
01:15:04,084 --> 01:15:05,084
