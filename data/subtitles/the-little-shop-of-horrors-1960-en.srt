1
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:22,414
<i>My name is Sergeant Joe Fink...</i>

2
00:00:22,616 --> 00:00:24,985
<i>... working a 24 hour shift on a homicide.</i>

3
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:26,624
<i>And this is my workshop.</i>

4
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:30,226
<i>The part of town that everybody knows about
but that nobody wants to see.</i>

5
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:33,070
<i>Where the tragedies is a deeper,
the ecstasies wilder...</i>

6
00:00:33,095 --> 00:00:35,679
<i>... and the crime rate
consistently higher than anywhere else</i>

7
00:00:36,405 --> 00:00:37,405
<i>Skid Row</i>

8
00:00:37,523 --> 00:00:38,523
<i>My beat.</i>

9
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:54,090
<i>The most terrifying period
in the history of my beat...</i>

10
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:57,224
<i>... began in a little rundown floral shop
called Mushnick's.</i>

11
00:02:02,115 --> 00:02:04,771
Ah, good morning Mrs. Shiva,
how's things today?

12
00:02:04,796 --> 00:02:07,404
The same as usual, Mr. Mushnick.

13
00:02:07,601 --> 00:02:09,858
My sister's nephew Stanley died.

14
00:02:09,883 --> 00:02:11,257
In Little Rock, Arkansas.

15
00:02:11,282 --> 00:02:12,726
Aww. What happened?

16
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:14,856
He got blown up
who knows how.

17
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:15,733
That's nice.

18
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,146
Well, you would like, maybe,
as usual some flowers for the funural?

19
00:02:19,216 --> 00:02:21,552
<i>♪ Should auld acquaintance be forgot,...</i>

20
00:02:21,577 --> 00:02:23,732
<i>♪ ... and never brought to mind?</i>

21
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:25,288
I thought, possibly,...

22
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,389
... because I always give you
all my funeral business...

23
00:02:28,421 --> 00:02:31,147
... and maybe you should possibly give to me, eh...

24
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:32,546
... a little cut today.

25
00:02:32,608 --> 00:02:34,439
Look on me, Mrs. Shiva.

26
00:02:34,483 --> 00:02:36,171
What am I?
A philatelist?

27
00:02:36,236 --> 00:02:39,100
I sell on Skid Row
nothing but cheap carnations.

28
00:02:39,654 --> 00:02:41,185
And I should give you a cut rate.

29
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,677
I can't even afford water for the flowers!

30
00:02:43,794 --> 00:02:45,771
To my throat I would be giving a cut.

31
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,271
<i>♪ I dreamt I dwelt in Marble Halls</i>

32
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:53,154

- Shut up from the back!

33
00:02:55,357 --> 00:02:56,888
Excuse me, Mrs. Shiva.

34
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,662
- That Seymour...
- He's a nice boy.

35
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:01,985
- Why don't you let him sing?
- What sing?!

36
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,977
Look: Here I got a new customer.

37
00:03:04,002 --> 00:03:05,321
Brand new in the yellow vest.

38
00:03:05,346 --> 00:03:06,439
I should let the clean up boy...

39
00:03:06,464 --> 00:03:09,628
... but I can't even afford
chase them out right away.

40
00:03:13,915 --> 00:03:16,657
Flowers fresh as the spring time.
Mushnick. Hello?

41
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:18,142
Oh, hello Dr. Farb.

42
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:19,423
<i>What can I do for you today?</i>

43
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,446
Listen, Mushink, I haven't got much time.

44
00:03:21,477 --> 00:03:23,961
Send me over two gladiolas and a fern.

45
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,023
Excellent, that's two dozen glads,
one pottet fern.

46
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:29,094
No, no, no, Mushnick!

47
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:31,330
Two gladiolas and one fern.

48
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:36,251
You want I should put
two gladiolas in the pot with the fern.

49
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:38,509
No, one fern, one piece.

50
00:03:38,534 --> 00:03:40,564
Altogether three pieces.

51
00:03:40,594 --> 00:03:41,984
I need it for my waiting room.

52
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,461
- A filling fell out.
- What?

53
00:03:44,486 --> 00:03:47,196
- A filling fell out.
- Good, I'll drill a bigger hole.

54
00:03:47,632 --> 00:03:50,265
You mean you want two crummy gladiolas
and one crummy fern?

55
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,125
What kind of a decoration is that?

56
00:03:52,203 --> 00:03:54,335
This is my flower budget for the week.

57
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:55,982
Mushnick.

58
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,186
Who can be a dentist on Skid Row?

59
00:03:58,232 --> 00:04:00,654
Fine, excellent.
I'll send Seymour right away.

60
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,630
<i>Who am I to argue with science?</i>

61
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:04,411
Make it snappy.

62
00:04:05,302 --> 00:04:07,123
Now you are going to get ...

63
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:10,209
...oh, you are going to get it.

64
00:04:10,474 --> 00:04:11,709
Look.

65
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,388
Seymour Krelborn!

66
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:19,818
Now, Mrs. Shiva.
We were talking from the funeral flowers.

67
00:04:19,864 --> 00:04:20,731
But the little...

68
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,715
Did you call me, Mr. Mushnick?

69
00:04:25,747 --> 00:04:30,918
No. I was calling John D. Rockefeller
for to make a loan on my Rolls Royce.

70
00:04:30,981 --> 00:04:32,184
Sorry I said it.

71
00:04:32,286 --> 00:04:33,599
Now look Seymour.

72
00:04:35,035 --> 00:04:36,840
You take two gladiolas.

73
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:38,528
You'll cut them nice and even.

74
00:04:38,558 --> 00:04:41,090
You'll take one fern.
You'll wrap them in a package...

75
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:43,058
... and you'll take them to Dr. Farb.

76
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,100
Right?

77
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:46,371
Now go already!

78
00:04:47,368 --> 00:04:48,837
Now what can I do for you, sir?

79
00:04:48,908 --> 00:04:50,204
Uh, my name is Burson Fouch.

80
00:04:50,251 --> 00:04:52,095
Excellent! I am Gravis Mushnick.

81
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,954
Oh, that's a good one.

82
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,806
Who is gonna get my roses?

83
00:04:54,831 --> 00:04:56,422
I'll take care of you, Mrs. Shiva.

84
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,548
Come right over here.

85
00:04:58,359 --> 00:05:01,609
You would like, maybe, some orchids
for a nice girl?

86
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,672
No, I think I'd like
a couple of dozen carnations.

87
00:05:03,907 --> 00:05:04,907
Carnations.

88
00:05:05,524 --> 00:05:08,852
A person find a lot of these these
that somebody shouldn't drop dead!

89
00:05:09,093 --> 00:05:11,795
You had more than
your share of bad luck, Mrs. Shiva.

90
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:13,256
Bad luck, she calls it.

91
00:05:13,342 --> 00:05:15,405
You should have so many people kicked off.

92
00:05:17,342 --> 00:05:19,104
About the carnations...

93
00:05:19,474 --> 00:05:20,810
You said you wanted some roses.

94
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:22,725
Yeah. For Stanley.

95
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:27,303
My carnations.

96
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:32,328
You should see wha--
See, Morris.

97
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:33,938
Oh, here are your carnations.

98
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,954
- Wait, I'll wrap them for you.
- No, it's all right. I'll eat them here.

99
00:05:41,985 --> 00:05:42,774
Why not?

100
00:05:45,977 --> 00:05:47,414
Of course. What else?

101
00:05:48,604 --> 00:05:49,604
They are alright?

102
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:50,540
Well, I've had better.

103
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,416
Well, this is a small shop.

104
00:05:52,441 --> 00:05:53,439
That's ok.

105
00:05:53,634 --> 00:05:54,658
You know: These big places...

106
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,759
...they are full of pretty flowers,
expensive flowers.

107
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,798
When you raise them for looks and smell
you're bound to lose some food value.

108
00:05:59,946 --> 00:06:01,775
I like these little out-of-the-way places.

109
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:05,173
Such a thing - eating flowers.

110
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,309
Look: Don't knock it until you try it, huh?

111
00:06:09,341 --> 00:06:10,341
Look what happened.

112
00:06:12,528 --> 00:06:15,234
This is what I was trying
to tell you before

113
00:06:15,294 --> 00:06:16,708
Look on him, everybody!

114
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:18,911
Look at the quality of his work!

115
00:06:19,034 --> 00:06:21,011
I ask you: When I fire him...

116
00:06:21,363 --> 00:06:23,348
... where is he gonna get
such another good job?

117
00:06:23,738 --> 00:06:24,738
You mean I'm fired?

118
00:06:24,762 --> 00:06:27,761
No, I'm electing you
president from the United States.

119
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,474
Yes, you are fired!

120
00:06:29,591 --> 00:06:32,028
- Gravis, you can't do that.
- Who? Who can't?

121
00:06:33,084 --> 00:06:35,029
- I didn't mean it.
- You didn't mean it.

122
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:36,528
You never mean it.

123
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:40,255
You didn't mean it the time you put up
the bouquet with the get well card...

124
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,396
...  in the funeral parlour.

125
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:43,169
And send the black lilies...

126
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,819
... to the old lady in the hospital,
you didn't mean it.

127
00:06:45,842 --> 00:06:46,967
But this time...

128
00:06:46,992 --> 00:06:49,929
... I, Gravis Mushnick, mean it!

129
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:52,007
He means it.

130
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:56,344
But see, Mr. Mushnick,
don't I always try to do what's right?

131
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:57,608
And i'm crazy about flowers.

132
00:06:57,633 --> 00:06:59,921
I like flowers almost as much
as Audrey does.

133
00:07:00,178 --> 00:07:01,795
Excellent.
You're fired.

134
00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:03,638
Why don't you give him a chance
to resurrect himself?

135
00:07:03,663 --> 00:07:05,349
I give him a chance to quit.

136
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:07,786
- I ain't gonna quit.
- You're a brave boy. You're fired!

137
00:07:08,591 --> 00:07:10,490
But that ain't fair, Mr. Mushnick.

138
00:07:10,661 --> 00:07:11,746
You know what I'm doin'?

139
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,179
I'm working on a special surprise plant
just for you.

140
00:07:15,247 --> 00:07:17,145
I'm growing a plant
like you ain't never seen before.

141
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,817
Excellent! I can't even sell
the plants I got in my shop.

142
00:07:19,842 --> 00:07:21,567
- Out, you!
- Now, wait a minute.

143
00:07:22,036 --> 00:07:23,755
If he's got a new kind of plant
you'll look at it.

144
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:26,006
I don't look on flowers, Mr. Yellowvest.

145
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:29,326
I got ancestors in the flower business
for 200 years.

146
00:07:29,351 --> 00:07:32,369
But I got one shop on Skid Row,
one stinking shop.

147
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,580
- I don't even like flowers!
- Now, you don't understand what I mean.

148
00:07:35,276 --> 00:07:37,964
Look: I've been eating in flower shops
all over the world.

149
00:07:38,306 --> 00:07:41,524
And I have noticed that the places that have the mosts
weird and unusal plants were the best business.

150
00:07:41,549 --> 00:07:42,228
See?

151
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,479
- See?
- See?

152
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,338
What is this?
A tango?

153
00:07:46,197 --> 00:07:47,197
Alright.

154
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:49,040
Explain me more.

155
00:07:49,548 --> 00:07:50,548
Well...

156
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:53,376
I remember one place that had a whole wall
covered with poison ivy.

157
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:55,173
And people came from miles around
to look at the wall.

158
00:07:55,198 --> 00:07:56,259
And they stayed to buy.

159
00:07:56,324 --> 00:07:57,354
The owner got rich?

160
00:07:57,526 --> 00:08:00,135
No. He scratched himself to death
in an insane asylum.

161
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,094
Oh!

162
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:02,789
That was my cousin Harry.

163
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,541
Alright.

164
00:08:05,135 --> 00:08:06,135
Alright.

165
00:08:06,714 --> 00:08:09,979
You go home and you get this fancy
schmancy plant and you bring it back here.

166
00:08:10,004 --> 00:08:13,414
And if Mr. Yellowvest Fouch says
it's a draw, you still got a job.

167
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,989
If he don't - out you go to Bodeo, right?

168
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,724
Dont' worry.
You'll like it - you'll see.

169
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:38,443
This is Radio KSIK

170
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:41,725
You've been listening to
"Music for Old Invalids".

171
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:43,811
Our next selection is entitled...

172
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:45,162
... "Sickroom Serenade"

173
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:48,295
Seymour, is that you?

174
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:49,647
Yeah, ma.

175
00:08:50,006 --> 00:08:51,225
Get in here.
Look at my tongue

176
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,920
But ma, I've already seen your tongue.

177
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:58,514
There be no sympathy for your poor mother?

178
00:08:58,568 --> 00:09:00,943
Laughing at her and mocking her illness...

179
00:09:00,968 --> 00:09:02,974
... and she's got one foot in the grave.

180
00:09:03,154 --> 00:09:05,294
- I didn't mean it.
- Oh, you never mean it.

181
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:07,060
Oh, come on. Look at my tongue.

182
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,397
That tongue is a tongue, ma.
They all look the same to me.

183
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:14,694
Did you stop at Dr. Mallard and
get the results of my tests?

184
00:09:14,943 --> 00:09:16,740
Yeah,he said there's nothing wrong with you.

185
00:09:16,827 --> 00:09:18,256
Oh, not Dr. Mallard.

186
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:20,862
He-He is one doctor
I thought would tell the truth.

187
00:09:20,896 --> 00:09:23,014
He said you sould be playing
fullback for the Rams.

188
00:09:23,068 --> 00:09:24,490
He wants me dead.

189
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:27,021
I'll bet he is assistant coroner.

190
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:29,324
Well, I gotta...
- A-A-And I know I got...

191
00:09:29,597 --> 00:09:33,378
My goiter's coming back.
I can feel it every morning after breakfast.

192
00:09:33,445 --> 00:09:34,781
Yeah, that's when you take those great...

193
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,312
What you got?
A little surprise for me?

194
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:41,335
- Open it up and see.
- Alright.

195
00:09:47,702 --> 00:09:50,507
Dr. Slurpsaddle's famous tonic.

196
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,493
Wait here.

197
00:09:54,337 --> 00:09:58,267
To be taken internally or
externally for pain and neuritis...

198
00:09:58,462 --> 00:10:01,032
... neuralgia, headaches, ...

199
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:04,134
... i-if hit by a truck,
call your physician.

200
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:08,189
Alcoholic content:
98 percent!

201
00:10:10,091 --> 00:10:11,560
Oh, Seymour.

202
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:14,599
You'll never know
what it is gonna do for me.

203
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:26,222
Oh, I can feel that surge of
warm health going through me already.

204
00:10:27,131 --> 00:10:30,240
Look, ma. I gotta get my plant
and hurry back to the shop.

205
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:32,327
You mean that
lousy weed out in the kitchen?

206
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:35,092
Yeah. If Mr. Mushnick doesn't like it,
he's gonna fire me.

207
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Apparently, my hearing is goin' out on me.

208
00:10:40,963 --> 00:10:42,978
I just had the faint impression...

209
00:10:43,064 --> 00:10:47,228
that your job security depends on
what Muchnick thanks of that thing.

210
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:50,056
It looks worse than it did this
morning when I went to work.

211
00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:51,860
I wish I knew what to do with it.

212
00:10:52,142 --> 00:10:54,759
Well, if you ask me,
I'd pitch it out in the trash.

213
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,369
I don't like my house cluttered up
with rotten vegetables.

214
00:10:57,394 --> 00:10:59,674
Look ma, I gotta hurry.
Can I bring you anything?

215
00:10:59,705 --> 00:11:02,814
Oh yeah, yeah.
Bring me the Evening News.

216
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,836
They're running a-a
self-diagnosis contest.

217
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:08,149
The winner gets to go to to Mayo Clinic.

218
00:11:08,174 --> 00:11:09,835
- Ha, ha.
- Bye, ma.

219
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,219
Bye, son.
I'll see you at the rosy edge of dawn!

220
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:17,383
<i>♪ Drink to me only with thine eyes</i>

221
00:11:17,408 --> 00:11:19,063
<i>♪ And I will ...</i>

222
00:11:23,908 --> 00:11:25,430
And put this on my bill.

223
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:29,705
Here it is everybody.

224
00:11:30,252 --> 00:11:31,666
What do you think of it?

225
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,861
Well...

226
00:11:33,165 --> 00:11:34,345
It sure is different.

227
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,531
It looks delicious but
don't you think it's kind of stale?

228
00:11:36,556 --> 00:11:38,389
I hasn't been feeling too well.

229
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:39,744
You call that a fancy plant?

230
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,626
It looks like it never spent
an healthy day in its entire life.

231
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,766
I don't care.

232
00:11:43,931 --> 00:11:45,079
I like it anyway.

233
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,212
You, you like even skunk cabbage.

234
00:11:47,237 --> 00:11:48,438
Yeah.

235
00:11:48,797 --> 00:11:50,624
What kind of a plant is this, Seymour?

236
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,055
Well, I'm not sure.

237
00:11:52,172 --> 00:11:55,160
I got the seeds from a Japanese gardener
over on Central Avenue.

238
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:58,820
He found them in with an order he got
from a plantation next to a cranberry farm.

239
00:11:58,845 --> 00:11:59,805
Fine.

240
00:11:59,882 --> 00:12:02,468
Fine. You don't even know what
is this plant you're groing.

241
00:12:02,703 --> 00:12:04,820
- Well, I gave it a name.
- What name?

242
00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:09,085
What? You gave it a dirty name you can't even mention it?

243
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:10,422
Well...

244
00:12:10,617 --> 00:12:11,812
I named it Audrey Jr.

245
00:12:12,843 --> 00:12:14,757
You named it after me?

246
00:12:14,782 --> 00:12:15,819
Oh, really?

247
00:12:16,077 --> 00:12:18,780
That's the most exiting thing
anyone's ever done to me.

248
00:12:18,842 --> 00:12:20,088
You poor kid.

249
00:12:20,308 --> 00:12:21,566
I don't think it's so much...

250
00:12:21,591 --> 00:12:25,135
... I should keep on spending
ten dollars a week on your salary.

251
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,011
But Gravis...

252
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,462
... he named it after me!

253
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:29,844
I know and if they keep it
they'll name it Mushnick's Folly...

254
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:32,455
... because I'll be in jail
because of non-payment of taxes.

255
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,885
- Are you crazy?
- Who? Who?

256
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,910
You. You.

257
00:12:34,946 --> 00:12:37,146
That's probably the only plant
of its kind in the world.

258
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:39,282
Don't you realize if Seymour can
nurse that thing back to health...

259
00:12:39,307 --> 00:12:41,212
... you have people
coming here from all over?

260
00:12:41,275 --> 00:12:43,376
- You think so, you Fouch?
- I know so, you Mushnick?

261
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,050
That's all I'm saying on the subject.

262
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:47,800
Sod, I got to get home.
My wife's making gardenias for dinner.

263
00:12:49,855 --> 00:12:51,394
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

264
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,550
I'll see you tomorrow.

265
00:12:53,417 --> 00:12:54,909
Crazy about kosher flowers.

266
00:12:56,245 --> 00:12:57,620
He's a nice man.

267
00:12:58,222 --> 00:13:00,144
Maybe he knows what he's talking about.

268
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:01,881
Maybe it's not so stupid.

269
00:13:02,886 --> 00:13:04,073
I'll tell you what I'll do.

270
00:13:04,776 --> 00:13:06,955
I'll keep you
and this Dumbell Jr. for a week.

271
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,354
If you can nurse it back to health,
you both can stay.

272
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:11,300
If you can't,
you're both fired.

273
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:13,236
Aw, gee.
Thank you, Mr. Mushnick.

274
00:13:16,856 --> 00:13:19,149
Don't feel sad, Seymour.

275
00:13:19,681 --> 00:13:22,525
Don't waste your pity on me Audrey,
I'm not worth it.

276
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,283
Who says you're not?

277
00:13:24,946 --> 00:13:26,055
Everybody.

278
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,330
Yeah, I know.

279
00:13:27,986 --> 00:13:30,986
But I think you're a fine
figurative of a man, and...

280
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:36,072
... and I know that Audrey Jr. will be the
sweetest thing in the whole, wide world!

281
00:13:36,306 --> 00:13:37,658
Well, I don't know.

282
00:13:37,993 --> 00:13:42,259
I've given it every kind of fancy fertilizer
and atomic plant food and...

283
00:13:42,284 --> 00:13:45,580
... distilled mineral water that you can buy
but I just gets sicker and sicker.

284
00:13:45,964 --> 00:13:47,097
Don't worry.

285
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,003
You're gonna be another
Luther Glendale.

286
00:13:50,065 --> 00:13:51,065
Pasadena.

287
00:13:51,237 --> 00:13:52,237
Burbank.

288
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:54,557
Good night, Seymour.

289
00:13:54,995 --> 00:13:56,369
G'night, Audrey.

290
00:14:05,465 --> 00:14:07,043
What's the matter little plant?

291
00:14:07,925 --> 00:14:10,441
Haven't I done everything
I could for you?

292
00:14:10,973 --> 00:14:12,433
Where did I goof?

293
00:14:14,277 --> 00:14:18,832
You're the first little plant I ever tried to grow,
and if you die, I dunno what I'll do!

294
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:20,364
Please don't die.

295
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,255
I'll get you some water, ok?

296
00:14:42,277 --> 00:14:43,613
Oh, gee.

297
00:14:43,738 --> 00:14:47,235
You opened up just like you do
every night at sunset.

298
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,417
I wish I knew how to make you grow.

299
00:14:50,465 --> 00:14:52,871
Here, let me move this out of your way
so you can breathe.

300
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:55,214
Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

301
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,689
Hey, what happened?

302
00:14:58,746 --> 00:15:00,150
How come you woke up?

303
00:15:01,644 --> 00:15:02,644
Blood?

304
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:04,230
You like blood?

305
00:15:07,187 --> 00:15:08,484
You must be kidding.

306
00:15:09,468 --> 00:15:10,468
Well, we'll see.

307
00:15:19,456 --> 00:15:20,871
You know,
what I'm doing for you...

308
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,663
Aww, who could have thought it?

309
00:15:33,757 --> 00:15:34,757
Well...

310
00:15:34,782 --> 00:15:37,639
I guess there's just no accounting
for people's taste.

311
00:15:49,023 --> 00:15:51,078
- Seymour!
- My boy.

312
00:15:51,103 --> 00:15:54,109
You're the most magnanimous
person in the whole world!

313
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:55,914
Look on him, Audrey.
Isn't he beautiful?

314
00:15:55,992 --> 00:15:57,250
Isn't he delicious?

315
00:15:57,468 --> 00:15:59,241
Isn't he got a two dollar raise?

316
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,656
What happened to your fingers?

317
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:01,804
Bee stings.

318
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:03,983
So how come
I'm all of a sudden so wonderful?

319
00:16:04,015 --> 00:16:05,858
Five bees?
One for each finger?

320
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:07,005
Ten bees.

321
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,796
Did you say I was getting a two dollar raise?

322
00:16:08,821 --> 00:16:10,710
Correct, my very excellent Seymour.

323
00:16:10,735 --> 00:16:12,826
- Indeed.
- What did I do now?

324
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,733
Don't you know what you did?

325
00:16:17,725 --> 00:16:19,647
Oh, boy!
Look at that!

326
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,279
It grew.

327
00:16:21,304 --> 00:16:23,013
It's almost a foot long.

328
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:24,498
Isn't it empirical?

329
00:16:24,662 --> 00:16:27,201
It grows like a cold sore from the lips.

330
00:16:28,553 --> 00:16:31,975
Oh, hello young pretty ladies.
What can Gravis Mushnick do for you?

331
00:16:32,014 --> 00:16:34,185
Well, we saw your sign outside.
About the Audrey Jr.

332
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,159
So we thought we'd come in and take a look.

333
00:16:36,184 --> 00:16:37,184
Well, give a look.

334
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:40,095
That makes four people today
who come in just to look at it.

335
00:16:40,128 --> 00:16:43,677
- Oh, dig Shirley.
- Is that just too much?

336
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,178
Oh, what kind of plant is it?

337
00:16:45,203 --> 00:16:46,474
It's an Audrey Jr.

338
00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:48,464
How was it you got in trouble with ten bees?!

339
00:16:48,489 --> 00:16:50,609
Is that all?
I mean, doesn't it have a scientific name?

340
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,804
Yes, of course.

341
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:52,968
But who could denounce it.

342
00:16:52,993 --> 00:16:54,969
You would like maybe to buy something.

343
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:56,298
Well, we don't have any money...

344
00:16:56,323 --> 00:16:57,993
... except 2000 dollars.

345
00:16:58,915 --> 00:17:00,595
But that's just to spend on flowers.

346
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,006
So we don't have any of our own.

347
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:03,199
Isn't that a drag?

348
00:17:03,224 --> 00:17:05,435
You got t-t-t-two thousand dollars...

349
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,489
... just for to spend on flowers?

350
00:17:07,514 --> 00:17:08,777
- Mhm.
- That's right.

351
00:17:08,802 --> 00:17:10,646
Who died?
The Chamber of Commerce?

352
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:12,005
We're all from Cucamonga high school.

353
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,170
We're building a float.

354
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:15,404
- For the Rose Bowl parade.
- Which is made of flowers.

355
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:17,301
- Thousands of them.
- And we're on the comittee.

356
00:17:17,326 --> 00:17:19,817
- That picks the florist.
- And then glues on the flowers.

357
00:17:21,591 --> 00:17:24,895
- Gee, that sure is a mad plant.
- Wow, yeah.

358
00:17:25,014 --> 00:17:26,490
Seymour here invented it.

359
00:17:26,553 --> 00:17:29,006
- He didn't!
- Oh!

360
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:31,014
Girls!
Girls, girls, girls!

361
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,794
Please don't damage the horticulturalist.

362
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,645
Tell me, how come you don't buy all these
thousands of flowers from Gravis Mushnick?

363
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,509
My flowers got something the others don't.

364
00:17:41,534 --> 00:17:42,942
- What's that?
- They're cheap.

365
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:43,967
Well, cheap.

366
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,235
If your shop is good enough
to develop the Audrey Jr...

367
00:17:46,335 --> 00:17:48,570
- I guess it can get everything we need.
- Yeah.

368
00:17:48,603 --> 00:17:50,305
We'll talk it over with the
rest of the committee.

369
00:17:50,344 --> 00:17:52,133
- Excellent.
- We've got to run now. Bye.

370
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:53,882
- Bye!
- Bye!

371
00:17:54,063 --> 00:17:55,258
Bye, girls.

372
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:00,433
A son.

373
00:18:01,335 --> 00:18:02,335
A son.

374
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,443
Look, Audrey!

375
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:05,404
I got a son.

376
00:18:05,716 --> 00:18:07,333
Oh, gee, Mr Mushnick.

377
00:18:07,358 --> 00:18:08,270
What, Mr. Mushnick?

378
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,709
I don't want you should
call me Mr. Mushnick anymore.

379
00:18:10,734 --> 00:18:12,686
I want you should call me dad.

380
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,296
Ok, dad.

381
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:16,099
Isn't that beautiful?

382
00:18:16,124 --> 00:18:17,647
Seymour Krelborn...

383
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:19,435
... come over here, my son.

384
00:18:19,749 --> 00:18:21,983
I want to talk on you
about the future.

385
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,205
Look on this fly trap.

386
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,230
Look on it.

387
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,715
Soon we got no more Skid Row.

388
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:30,068
We will be rich.
Us.

389
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,896
I am building for you...

390
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,380
... a giant greenhouse in which you are
making impossible flowers...

391
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:38,774
... which in turn I am selling
at ridiculous prices...

392
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,338
... in my giant new flower saloon
in Beverly Hills.

393
00:18:43,345 --> 00:18:45,821
Do you see that big sign in the sky?

394
00:18:46,604 --> 00:18:47,760
It is saying...

395
00:18:48,243 --> 00:18:50,470
... "Gravis Mushnick", in French.

396
00:18:50,618 --> 00:18:51,970
Isn't it exciting?

397
00:18:52,376 --> 00:18:55,415
And we'll have an orchestra
right by the cash register, ...

398
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,412
... and Gravis will wave his arms...

399
00:18:57,437 --> 00:19:00,482
... and the orchestra will play
Mendelssohn's Spring Song.

400
00:19:01,044 --> 00:19:04,473
I'll come out in a gown,
wrapped by someone expensive and say:

401
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,255
"The carnations are
600 dollars a dozen,"...

402
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,520
... "two dozen for a thousand."

403
00:19:08,545 --> 00:19:11,161
- It's a bargain!
- Get 'em while they last

404
00:19:11,186 --> 00:19:12,247
Stop shouting.

405
00:19:12,356 --> 00:19:18,750
My uncle Moishen's brother Yankel
just passed away in New Jersey.

406
00:19:19,036 --> 00:19:20,036
Tell me...

407
00:19:20,207 --> 00:19:22,121
... how much are the carnations today?

408
00:19:22,146 --> 00:19:24,364
The carnations are 600 dollars a dozen.

409
00:19:24,389 --> 00:19:26,637
And why are they
letting him run around loose?

410
00:19:26,677 --> 00:19:29,168
Please.
Please excuse my son, Mrs. Shiva.

411
00:19:29,215 --> 00:19:31,560
Just point anything in the store
and it is yours.

412
00:19:31,585 --> 00:19:32,830
You mean anything?

413
00:19:32,855 --> 00:19:33,855
That's right.

414
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,835
- The cash register, maybe, huh?
- Ah.

415
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,997
Wait a minute.

416
00:19:37,022 --> 00:19:38,255
Here.

417
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,325
Here are several dozen carnations...

418
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:45,692
... on the house courtesey of
Gravis Mushnick, the bloom tycoon.

419
00:19:45,724 --> 00:19:47,808
- That's my dad.
- Thanks.

420
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,591
Thanks very much.

421
00:19:50,751 --> 00:19:51,868
Only, tell me...

422
00:19:52,252 --> 00:19:53,494
Why are you so happy?

423
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:57,884
Not only did my uncle Moishe's brother
Yankel die...

424
00:19:58,377 --> 00:20:00,002
... in New Jersey...

425
00:20:01,515 --> 00:20:04,296
... we should also give some flowers
to that poor dead plant there.

426
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,218
Good morning, Mr. Mushnick.

427
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:09,271
Good morning.

428
00:20:09,851 --> 00:20:10,983
Good morning, Mrs. Shiva.

429
00:20:11,046 --> 00:20:13,062
Look what happened to my plant, dad.

430
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,726
Who're you calling dad?
Who? Who?

431
00:20:14,751 --> 00:20:15,751
Oh no!

432
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:18,975
- It was so beautiful just a few seconds ago.
- Excellent.

433
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:22,107
Just a few seconds ago I gave
away dozens of carnations.

434
00:20:22,132 --> 00:20:23,482
Free!
To Mrs. Shiva.

435
00:20:23,507 --> 00:20:24,514
I didn't mean it.

436
00:20:25,263 --> 00:20:27,693
You have perhaps an explanation.

437
00:20:27,904 --> 00:20:30,319
No, but if you give me a minute
I'll think of one.

438
00:20:30,344 --> 00:20:31,771
I can see it all now.

439
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:33,631
We're in the poorhouse.

440
00:20:33,677 --> 00:20:37,059
The big sign in the sky
it is reading:

441
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,434
"Seymour Krelborn.
Rest in Peace."

442
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:41,661
In Arabic!

443
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,614
Oh, you've got to give him another chance.

444
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:45,825
You promised me a week, Mr. Mushnick.

445
00:20:45,982 --> 00:20:47,614
I'd sit up all night with that plant.

446
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:49,496
It'll be healthy in the morning,
you'll see.

447
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:50,654
I promise.

448
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:52,231
I promise.

449
00:21:01,507 --> 00:21:04,301
<i>Feed meeee.</i>

450
00:21:08,497 --> 00:21:11,520
<i>Feed meeee.</i>

451
00:21:12,717 --> 00:21:14,491
<i>Feed meeee!</i>

452
00:21:18,288 --> 00:21:19,381
Who said that?

453
00:21:19,538 --> 00:21:20,538
You said that.

454
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:21,881
You said that!

455
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,661
Mhm.
Feed me!

456
00:21:26,302 --> 00:21:27,443
You said that.

457
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:29,529
You can talk.

458
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:31,685
I got a talking plant.

459
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:33,616
- Say it again.
- Feed me.

460
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:35,944
Oh boy!

461
00:21:36,538 --> 00:21:38,866
I've never been to college and
I ain't been around much...

462
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,557
... but I would be willing to bet there
ain't no such thing as a talking plant!

463
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,756
I'll take your word for it.

464
00:21:45,366 --> 00:21:47,420
Gee, Junior,
I'd-I'd like to feed you.

465
00:21:47,795 --> 00:21:49,366
But I've used up all my fingers.

466
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,092
Feeeeeeed.

467
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:56,905
Look at me,
I'm all cut to pieces.

468
00:21:57,152 --> 00:22:00,206
But maybe I can find
another drop here someplace.

469
00:22:06,597 --> 00:22:08,246
That's the best I can do.

470
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:11,072
More!
More!

471
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:12,778
But I'm already anaemic.

472
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:16,230
Feed me more!

473
00:22:16,512 --> 00:22:17,512
See, Junior,...

474
00:22:17,551 --> 00:22:19,645
I'd be happy to give you anything I got...

475
00:22:19,988 --> 00:22:23,300
... but I gotta keep a little blood for myself
or I'll be in worse shape than ma.

476
00:22:23,335 --> 00:22:24,553
Mmm.

477
00:22:25,264 --> 00:22:26,694
I'm sorry, Junior.

478
00:22:27,053 --> 00:22:29,412
I'll go for a walk.
Maybe I'll think of something.

479
00:25:12,828 --> 00:25:14,828
Feed me!

480
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:17,765
Feed me!

481
00:25:17,859 --> 00:25:19,031
Look, chow-hound.

482
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:21,961
Don't bother me.
I got problems of my own.

483
00:25:22,328 --> 00:25:23,539
Feed me!

484
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:26,953
I am sorry, pal. I am fresh out of blood.
Talk to somebody else.

485
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,717
I am hungry!

486
00:25:28,742 --> 00:25:30,327
I don't care what you are.

487
00:25:30,851 --> 00:25:32,234
Can't you see I am knocked out?

488
00:25:32,351 --> 00:25:33,624
I just killed a man.

489
00:25:34,202 --> 00:25:35,374
I'm a murderer.

490
00:25:35,928 --> 00:25:37,631
Think it's fun to be a murderer?

491
00:25:37,671 --> 00:25:38,843
You think it's fun to...

492
00:25:38,936 --> 00:25:40,358
...haul around a sack full of...

493
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,303
...fooooood.

494
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,646
No, no, Junior!
What kind of guy do you think I am?

495
00:25:45,671 --> 00:25:47,662
I'm starved.

496
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:52,710
Maybe just a snack.

497
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,443
That looks great.

498
00:26:16,495 --> 00:26:17,494
What you call that salad?

499
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:18,519
Nefarious.

500
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,117
Well, before the next course...

501
00:26:21,601 --> 00:26:23,255
... I think I'll have a nice cigar.

502
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,280
Alright?

503
00:26:24,812 --> 00:26:26,280
You would like maybe a cigar?

504
00:26:26,395 --> 00:26:27,809
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

505
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:29,785
Ah, you don't smoke cigars, right.

506
00:26:29,949 --> 00:26:32,207
What am I thinking about?
Where are the matches?

507
00:26:33,286 --> 00:26:34,434
Oh, oi!

508
00:26:35,285 --> 00:26:36,332
You know what I found?

509
00:26:37,065 --> 00:26:38,526
I'm looking for the matches...

510
00:26:39,244 --> 00:26:41,329
And I found I left the
money in the red suit.

511
00:26:44,556 --> 00:26:46,392
Here's your mock chicken leg.

512
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:47,721
You don't have any money?

513
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:53,259
So what else is new?

514
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:54,869
Alright.
Alright!

515
00:26:54,894 --> 00:26:56,025
I made a mistake.

516
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,986
After all, a man is entitled.

517
00:26:58,571 --> 00:27:00,282
Go on. This is your story.

518
00:27:00,524 --> 00:27:01,923
I'll wait for the punch.

519
00:27:02,134 --> 00:27:04,454
Don't get smart with me, girlie.

520
00:27:04,578 --> 00:27:07,460
I'll have you know that in my shop
in the cash register...

521
00:27:07,485 --> 00:27:10,079
... I'm having the total day's receipts...

522
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,868
... which is summing up
to more than nine dollars.

523
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:14,687
You'll bring the rest of the food...

524
00:27:14,712 --> 00:27:17,031
... and I'll go the the
shop and get the money!

525
00:27:17,585 --> 00:27:20,507
You are playing my favorite song.

526
00:27:21,069 --> 00:27:22,499
Now, look here, buster.

527
00:27:22,733 --> 00:27:25,514
One of you is gonna go down
right now and get the loot...

528
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:29,226
... while the other one stays here
until the first one gets back.

529
00:27:29,531 --> 00:27:31,367
If you get what I mean?

530
00:27:31,392 --> 00:27:32,421
Oh, fine.

531
00:27:32,446 --> 00:27:36,335
In this fancy schmancy restaurant
you are holding hostages, right?

532
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,360
Right.

533
00:27:38,695 --> 00:27:39,695
Excellent.

534
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:42,299
You eat up, Audrey.

535
00:27:42,749 --> 00:27:45,288
I'll be back in a flash
with the cash.

536
00:27:45,313 --> 00:27:46,313
Bye, Gravis.

You're flush now, right?

00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:39,279
Bring me whiskey, rum, wine, gin, bourbon.

548
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:43,747
- Why?
- Scotch, rye, tequila, sake, manishevitz

549
00:28:43,772 --> 00:28:45,061
Did you bring the money?

550
00:28:45,086 --> 00:28:48,320
Don't mock me with the money.
I got to get drunk now.

551
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:49,656
What's with him?

552
00:28:49,681 --> 00:28:50,681
- I don't know.
- Look.

553
00:28:50,914 --> 00:28:52,914
Here, take it.
Bring me anything.

554
00:28:52,953 --> 00:28:55,326
Bring everything. Creme de menthe.
Everything you've got!

555
00:28:55,351 --> 00:28:56,382
Ok!

556
00:28:57,742 --> 00:28:58,742
Gravis?

557
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,563
- What happened?
- Don't ask.

558
00:29:00,774 --> 00:29:02,172
You look like you've seen a ghost.

559
00:29:02,227 --> 00:29:04,461
Ghosts I could handle.
Don't ask.

560
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,224
Why don't you tell me?
Maybe I could help you.

561
00:29:06,249 --> 00:29:07,710
Help, you couldn't.

562
00:29:08,296 --> 00:29:10,647
Try and eat something.
It'll calm your agrimation.

563
00:29:13,702 --> 00:29:15,070
In mine own shop...

564
00:29:15,851 --> 00:29:17,367
Audrey, you wouldn't believe it.

565
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,318
I wish you'd break out and tell me.

566
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:20,467
Alright, I'll tell you.

567
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:23,334
Tomorrow.
Right after I am telling the police.

568
00:29:26,271 --> 00:29:28,176
<i>But Mushnick didn't come to the police.</i>

569
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:29,975
If he had...

570
00:29:30,154 --> 00:29:32,471
<i>... that might have been the
finish of the unhappy story.</i>

571
00:29:32,975 --> 00:29:33,975
It was not.

572
00:29:51,418 --> 00:29:52,418
Hi, Gravis.

573
00:29:52,838 --> 00:29:56,316
85 dollars worth of business
already, and we've barely opened!

574
00:29:59,254 --> 00:30:00,254
What'd I tell you?

575
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:03,230
You wouldn't be interested in selling
a half-interest to this place, huh?

576
00:30:03,652 --> 00:30:05,574
- Mr. Mushnick.
- We talked to the comittee.

577
00:30:05,628 --> 00:30:08,056
- And they said we could use your flowers.
- On the float.

578
00:30:08,081 --> 00:30:10,674
- And guess what?
- We're going to feature Audrey Jr.

579
00:30:10,699 --> 00:30:13,174
- Right on top.
- Can't you just picture it?

580
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:15,846
- I can picture it.
- Oh, won't the people just eat it up?

581
00:30:15,871 --> 00:30:17,152
Eat up the people.

582
00:30:17,245 --> 00:30:19,113
And we're gonna have the big part of it open.

583
00:30:19,245 --> 00:30:20,574
- Of course she can fit in it.
- Who?

584
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:22,832
- The queen.
- With her crown and scepter.

585
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:24,434
She'll be so cute!

586
00:30:24,459 --> 00:30:27,052
- Oh, you could just eat her up.
- Eat up the girl.

587
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:28,568
Oh, there's Seymour!

588
00:30:28,638 --> 00:30:30,388
Oh, Seymour!

589
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:31,874
Ow, ow, ow, ow!
I got a toothache.

590
00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:33,750
Ow, I got a toothache.
Really, I...

591
00:30:34,492 --> 00:30:35,492
You...

592
00:30:35,531 --> 00:30:37,851
- Come with me.
- I got a toothache! It hurts!

593
00:30:37,876 --> 00:30:39,476
Ow, let go of my jaw.

594
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,187
Ow, my jaw.
Ow, ow.

595
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:43,664
Owwww.

596
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:44,875
Now, Seymour.

597
00:30:45,068 --> 00:30:46,068
Talk on me!

598
00:30:46,093 --> 00:30:48,046
I got a toothache.
What do you wanna talk about?

599
00:30:48,071 --> 00:30:50,968
That plant.
Is that a nice subject for to talk?

600
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:52,617
The plant is great,
it's...

601
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,163
... it's it's four times
bigger than it was yesterday.

602
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:57,257
I saw, I saw.
How come the plant is now so big?

603
00:30:57,687 --> 00:30:58,859
I don't know.

604
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:01,420
But look at them people out there.

605
00:31:01,553 --> 00:31:04,631
We only been open a half hour we already
done 70 dollars worth of business.

606
00:31:04,756 --> 00:31:06,592
85.
Now look, Seymour.

607
00:31:07,552 --> 00:31:10,175
You gave this plant a fancy name:
Audrey Jr.

608
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,054
But I want to know right now
what do just people call it?

609
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,371
Well...

610
00:31:14,396 --> 00:31:16,677
well it's a cross between a butterworth
and a venus flytrap.

611
00:31:16,702 --> 00:31:18,293
Venus flytrap!

612
00:31:18,318 --> 00:31:20,810
And what are the habbits
of this Venus flytrap?

613
00:31:21,037 --> 00:31:22,825
Well, the book says it eats insects.

614
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,896
It eats them three times in it's life...

615
00:31:24,952 --> 00:31:26,842
- ... and then it's full grown.
- Excellent!

616
00:31:26,994 --> 00:31:29,490
And how many times is this one eat?

617
00:31:29,615 --> 00:31:30,615
Well...

618
00:31:31,077 --> 00:31:32,209
Once or twice.

619
00:31:32,528 --> 00:31:33,965
You don't remember?

620
00:31:34,402 --> 00:31:37,082
Well, this is kind of an
unusual type flytrap.

621
00:31:37,207 --> 00:31:39,309
That is a possibility.

622
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,760
It may never eat again.
I don't see how it could get any bigger.

623
00:31:43,355 --> 00:31:46,324
Then you think it don't
need any more flies?

624
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:48,105
Yeah.

625
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,714
Ow, my tooth is just killing me.

626
00:31:53,565 --> 00:31:54,565
Alright.
Excellent.

627
00:31:55,296 --> 00:31:57,007
You run along to the dentist.

628
00:31:57,397 --> 00:31:58,829
I'll take care of things here.

629
00:31:59,381 --> 00:32:00,381
Thanks, boss.

630
00:32:01,077 --> 00:32:04,085
Gravis!
We got to order more flowers.

631
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,545
Tons of them.

632
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:13,251
I'm making lots of money.

633
00:32:24,733 --> 00:32:26,936
<i>Argh!
Argh! Argh!</i>

634
00:32:27,647 --> 00:32:29,030
<i>Please don't hurt!</i>

635
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,491
<i>Please don't hurt me!</i>

636
00:32:30,804 --> 00:32:32,475
<i>Argh!

<i>That'll teach you to keep your

638

<i>Argh! Argh!
Argh!</i>

639
00:32:46,386 --> 00:32:47,706
Well, then run,
you snivelling dog!

640
00:32:48,104 --> 00:32:50,386
I'm glad, I hurt you.
I'm glad. I'm glad.

641
00:32:50,932 --> 00:32:51,932
Seymour.

642
00:32:52,065 --> 00:32:53,862
Seymore.
Got a bad tooth, huh?

643
00:32:53,887 --> 00:32:55,385
No, I thought this
was the men's room!

644
00:32:55,417 --> 00:32:58,644
Seymour, come back here, you bad dog.
You get in there.

645
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:03,823
So, you are the young man
who ruined my gladiolas, huh?

646
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:04,848
Sit down.

647
00:33:04,873 --> 00:33:06,230
Come on.

648
00:33:11,475 --> 00:33:12,475
Guess what?

649
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:14,209
- My tooth stopped hurting.
- My tooth stopped hurting.

650
00:33:14,234 --> 00:33:15,280
Yes, I know.

651
00:33:15,413 --> 00:33:16,413
Let's see.

652
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:18,272
Shut up and open up.

653
00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:19,569
Uh-huh.

654
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:21,809
Ah.

655
00:33:24,178 --> 00:33:25,709
- Argh!
- Does that hurt?

656
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,178
- Yeah!
- Good. You haven't felt anything yet.

657
00:33:28,388 --> 00:33:30,778
- Ah-ha.
- It's this one over here.

658
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:33,216
Seymour.
Who is the dentist here, you or me?

659
00:33:33,482 --> 00:33:34,849
I'll find that tooth.

660
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,920
M-hm.

661
00:33:35,997 --> 00:33:36,997
Ah-ha.

662
00:33:37,785 --> 00:33:40,660
Look at that stalagmite.

663
00:33:40,707 --> 00:33:43,410
But don't worry.
It's going to be an easy one, Seymour.

664
00:33:43,435 --> 00:33:44,857
I won't even use Novocaine.

665
00:33:45,061 --> 00:33:47,232
Ow, you poked the mirror in my mouth.

666
00:33:47,257 --> 00:33:49,240
Well, don't tell me about it, stupid.
Just swallow it.

667
00:33:50,591 --> 00:33:52,929
Alright.
Here's the thing now, Seymour.

668
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,958
I think I'll have this one
and this one...

669
00:33:56,169 --> 00:33:58,169
... and that one and I
have to have this one, Seymour!

670
00:33:58,194 --> 00:33:59,443
It's only one tooth.

671
00:33:59,468 --> 00:34:00,553
Seymour, who is the dentist here, ...

672
00:34:00,578 --> 00:34:03,132
.. you or me? Are you practising
dentistry without a license?

673
00:34:04,171 --> 00:34:05,828
- Alright
- Uh-hu.

674
00:34:05,976 --> 00:34:07,117
Let's see.

675
00:34:08,406 --> 00:34:10,570
Oh shit!
Seymour.

676
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:14,062
<i>- ♪ Seymour, don't be...</i>
- Argh!

677
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,961
Argh!

678
00:34:16,437 --> 00:34:17,437
Look at that.

679
00:34:17,569 --> 00:34:19,468
Will you look at that, Seymour?

680
00:34:19,493 --> 00:34:21,211
I  didn't know you were an elk.

681
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:22,353
Good.

682
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:23,853
You know...

683
00:34:24,048 --> 00:34:26,055
... I can't afford an assistant,...

684
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:29,172
... so I get this ready instant mix.

685
00:34:29,563 --> 00:34:31,462
It doesn't last very long
but it tastes good.

686
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:32,759
Mmm.

687
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:34,976
Alright, Seymour.

688
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,399
Stay away from me!

689
00:34:36,437 --> 00:34:38,578
See? You're trying to kill me.

690
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,618
A duel! Ah-ha!

691
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:55,639
Is this doctor's office?

692
00:34:55,671 --> 00:34:56,975
Just a minute!

693
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,514
Aww, yes.

694
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,569
I see it is.

695
00:35:07,219 --> 00:35:09,336
I...
you-you can come in now.

696
00:35:17,227 --> 00:35:19,236
My name is Wilbur Force.

697
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:20,829
Wilburforce what?

698
00:35:21,181 --> 00:35:22,181
Just...

699
00:35:22,742 --> 00:35:23,812
Wilbur Force.

700
00:35:23,836 --> 00:35:27,110
My first name is Wilbur,
my last name is Force.

701
00:35:28,008 --> 00:35:29,539
I don't have a middle name.

702
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:31,453
Well, you have an appointment, maybe?

703
00:35:31,842 --> 00:35:34,889
I don't have a middle name well you have
an appointment may be no but you were

704
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:36,475
... one of your patients.

705
00:35:36,508 --> 00:35:38,288
A Mrs. S. Shiva.

706
00:35:38,313 --> 00:35:41,093
I do a lot of undertaking
for her relatives.

707
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:44,258
Well, as you could see,
I have a customer now...

708
00:35:44,757 --> 00:35:48,444
... and I'm all booked up for the rest of the
day, so you have to come back tomorrow.

709
00:35:48,686 --> 00:35:50,303
Oh, I couldn't do that.

710
00:35:50,343 --> 00:35:52,327
I have three or four abscesses...

711
00:35:52,352 --> 00:35:53,739
... a touch of pyorrhea...

712
00:35:53,764 --> 00:35:55,389
... nine or ten cavities...

713
00:35:55,414 --> 00:35:58,365
I lost my pivot tooth
and I'm in terrible pain.

714
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:01,174
Well, I-I can't help you today.

715
00:36:01,511 --> 00:36:03,292
Oh, that's alright.

716
00:36:03,323 --> 00:36:05,339
I'll go just wait outside.

717
00:36:15,493 --> 00:36:19,055
The patient came to me with a
large hole in his abdomen...

718
00:36:19,914 --> 00:36:23,046
... caused by a fire poker
used on him by his wife.

719
00:36:24,273 --> 00:36:27,187
He almost bled to death
and gangrene had set in.

720
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:29,921
I didn't give me much of a chance.

721
00:36:30,304 --> 00:36:31,960
There were other complications.

722
00:36:32,343 --> 00:36:36,929
The man had cancer,
tuberculosis, leprosy ...

723
00:36:37,085 --> 00:36:38,898
... and a touch of the grippe.

724
00:36:39,999 --> 00:36:41,788
I decided to operate.

725
00:36:41,874 --> 00:36:44,023
My... my patient just left.

726
00:36:44,078 --> 00:36:45,499
You cou... you could come in now.

727
00:36:46,006 --> 00:36:47,077
Oh goodie.

728
00:36:49,694 --> 00:36:52,343
- I didn't see the other man leave.
- Well...

729
00:36:52,452 --> 00:36:54,045
... he went out the back door

730
00:36:57,896 --> 00:37:00,677
You know, most people don't
like to go to the dentist...

731
00:37:00,709 --> 00:37:03,878
... but I rather enjoy it myself, don't you?

732
00:37:03,911 --> 00:37:05,090
I mean there is such...

733
00:37:05,115 --> 00:37:07,324
... there is a real feeling of growth,
of ...

734
00:37:07,699 --> 00:37:08,699
... of...

735
00:37:09,379 --> 00:37:11,020
... progress when that...

736
00:37:11,067 --> 00:37:12,895
... that old drill goes in...

737
00:37:13,068 --> 00:37:17,059
... and I'd almost rather go to the
dentist than anywhere, wouldn't you?

738
00:37:17,084 --> 00:37:18,084
Yeah.

739
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:20,529
Now, no Novocaine.

740
00:37:20,554 --> 00:37:21,959
It dulls the senses.

741
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,710
This is gonna hurt you more than it is me.

742
00:37:25,735 --> 00:37:27,749
Oh, goodie goodie, here it comes.

743
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,382
Argh!

744
00:37:31,233 --> 00:37:32,428
Argh!

745
00:37:34,194 --> 00:37:35,139
Argh!

746
00:37:35,725 --> 00:37:38,561
Oh my god,
don't stop now!

747
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:40,279
Well, I made a lot of holes...

748
00:37:40,304 --> 00:37:42,639
... and now I've gotta fill it with this silver stuff.

749
00:37:42,709 --> 00:37:44,670
Well, aren't you gonna pull any?

750
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:47,826
- Well, uh...
- Oh, come on.

751
00:37:49,045 --> 00:37:50,818
Well, it's your mouth.

752
00:37:59,198 --> 00:38:00,261
Argh!

753
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:02,573
Argh!

754
00:38:04,089 --> 00:38:05,042
Argh!

755
00:38:08,409 --> 00:38:09,698
Well, Dr. Farb...

756
00:38:09,885 --> 00:38:11,839
... it's been quite an afternoon.

757
00:38:12,028 --> 00:38:15,494
I can truly say
I've never enjoyed myself so much.

758
00:38:15,573 --> 00:38:18,279
I'll recommend you to all my friends.

759
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,397
Thank you.
Bye.

760
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,819
Bye, now.

761
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:31,555
Feed me!

762
00:38:31,605 --> 00:38:32,909
Oh, take it easy, Dracula.

763
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:35,214
What do you think I'm carrying here?
My dirty laundry?

764
00:38:40,325 --> 00:38:41,434
<i>Feed!</i>

765
00:38:41,566 --> 00:38:43,560
I'm coming!
I'm coming already.

766
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:50,290
This should be enough for anybody.

767
00:38:50,315 --> 00:38:51,315
Mhm.

768
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,057
Fooood.

769
00:38:58,162 --> 00:39:00,068
Well, goodbye Dr. Farb.

770
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:03,224
You may have been a crummy dentist
but you were a nice fellow.

771
00:39:03,855 --> 00:39:06,120
I never meant to kill
anybody in my whole life.

772
00:39:06,175 --> 00:39:08,570
Now I killed two in the last two days.

773
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:12,448
Well, he asked for it coming
at me with that knife and all.

774
00:39:13,808 --> 00:39:15,425
Bon voyage, Dr Farb.

775
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,237
Want anything else?

776
00:39:17,511 --> 00:39:19,244
[BURP]

777
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:20,541
[BURP]

778
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:22,596
See you in the morning.

779
00:39:42,419 --> 00:39:43,419
Come in.

780
00:39:44,857 --> 00:39:45,857
It's me, Joe.

781
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,342
Good morning, Frank.

782
00:39:48,287 --> 00:39:49,369
How's the wife, Frank?

783
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:51,193
- Not bad, Joe.
- Glad to hear it.

784
00:39:51,443 --> 00:39:53,014
- The kids?
- Lost one yesterday.

785
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,842
Awful, eh?
How did that happen?

786
00:39:55,015 --> 00:39:56,335
Playing with matches.

787
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,538
Well, those are the breaks.

788
00:39:57,749 --> 00:39:58,749
Yeah, I guess so.

789
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:00,165
Got a strange one here.

790
00:40:00,352 --> 00:40:02,938
Railroad people say the last one of their
best detectives the other night.

791
00:40:02,963 --> 00:40:03,883
Where?

792
00:40:03,908 --> 00:40:04,907
Down by the yards.

793
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:06,562
He was watching refrigerator cars.

794
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,109
Refrigerator cars?

795
00:40:08,648 --> 00:40:10,874
- Ice thieves.
- Oh yeah? What happened?

796
00:40:10,899 --> 00:40:11,899
Don't know.

797
00:40:11,898 --> 00:40:13,796
- Vanished, right on the tracks.
- Clues?

798
00:40:14,608 --> 00:40:15,608
None.

799
00:40:15,633 --> 00:40:16,633
Anything else?

800
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,211
Dentist. Farb.

801
00:40:18,351 --> 00:40:19,796
- Dead?
- Missing.

802
00:40:20,023 --> 00:40:21,132
Clues?

803
00:40:21,234 --> 00:40:22,632
- Blood in the office.
- Where?

804
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:24,444
- Skid Row.
- Ideas?

805
00:40:25,171 --> 00:40:26,296
- None.
- Check it out?

806
00:40:27,288 --> 00:40:28,288
Yeah.

807
00:40:36,421 --> 00:40:37,882
<i>Now we were on the case,</i>

808
00:40:38,273 --> 00:40:39,851
<i>... officer Frank Stoolie and me.</i>

809
00:40:40,609 --> 00:40:41,726
<i>My name is Fink.</i>

810
00:40:42,617 --> 00:40:43,726
<i>Sergeant Joe Fink.</i>

811
00:40:44,773 --> 00:40:45,773
<i>I'm a fink.</i>

812
00:41:05,035 --> 00:41:06,339
Morning, Mr Mushnick.

813
00:41:07,207 --> 00:41:09,152
Oh, boy, look at that!

814
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:10,730
Hi, everybody.

815
00:41:11,777 --> 00:41:13,566
Oh, my god!

816
00:41:13,652 --> 00:41:15,511
- Ain't it something?
- It's...

817
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,824
It's monstrositous!

818
00:41:18,034 --> 00:41:19,034
Yeah.

819
00:41:19,542 --> 00:41:21,886
And to think that you did it.

820
00:41:23,589 --> 00:41:25,565
Gee, Audrey. You don't have to kiss me.

821
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:27,699
Don't you like me to kiss you?

822
00:41:28,284 --> 00:41:30,596
Yeah, but...
you don't like to kiss me.

823
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,128
Why shouldn't I?

824
00:41:32,518 --> 00:41:34,167
Nobody else ever did.

825
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:35,831
Well, I do like to.

826
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:38,274
You do? You really do?
You like to kiss me?

827
00:41:38,299 --> 00:41:39,206
Sure, I do.

828
00:41:39,231 --> 00:41:40,847
Would... would you like to kiss me again?

829
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,190
Ok.

830
00:41:42,215 --> 00:41:43,627
That plant...

831
00:41:46,569 --> 00:41:49,374
Oh, boy! You kiss good, Audrey.

832
00:41:49,428 --> 00:41:51,795
Oh, I guess I just have a good kisser.

833
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,662
H-h-h-how d-d-did...

834
00:41:53,687 --> 00:41:55,912
Would you like to go out on
a date with me some night?

835
00:41:56,053 --> 00:41:58,186
- When...?
- Oh, sure I would, Seymour.

836
00:41:58,211 --> 00:41:59,906
- Any time.
- Tonight?

837
00:42:00,224 --> 00:42:01,255
Ok.

838
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:04,076
- Oh, boy!
- A-a-a-about that plant...

839
00:42:05,037 --> 00:42:06,475
- We got the list.
- Of flowers.

840
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,514
- For the float.
- For the rose parade.

841
00:42:08,561 --> 00:42:10,514
I can't talk to you now, girls.

842
00:42:10,764 --> 00:42:11,879
Talk on Audrey.

843
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,662
- We got the list.
- With the float.

844
00:42:13,687 --> 00:42:15,452
- It's ok. Let's take a look at it.
- Ok.

845
00:42:15,569 --> 00:42:16,593
Hi, what's cookin'?

846
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:17,679
Look at my plant.

847
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:20,240
- My, what a large one.
- Yeah.

848
00:42:25,817 --> 00:42:27,864
Hello, Mrs. Shiva. What's new?

849
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:30,075
Oy, I got terrible news.

850
00:42:30,739 --> 00:42:33,379
My nephew Frankie just lost his little boy.

851
00:42:33,481 --> 00:42:34,887
Oh, that's too bad.

852
00:42:34,912 --> 00:42:35,927
How did it happen?

853
00:42:35,952 --> 00:42:37,606
He was playing with matches.

854
00:42:37,757 --> 00:42:39,553
Would you like to buy, maybe, some flowers?

855
00:42:39,811 --> 00:42:41,967
Nah... about 50 cents worth.

856
00:42:42,085 --> 00:42:44,100
So I'll get the for you.
Look at my plant!

857
00:42:44,202 --> 00:42:45,608
I'm looking.

858
00:42:51,584 --> 00:42:54,568
- Your name Gravis Mushnick?
- M-M-Mushnick, Gravis. That's my name.

859
00:42:54,732 --> 00:42:55,865
Just want to ask you a few questions.

860
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:58,059
- Questions ask me why?
- Just want to ask a few questions.

861
00:42:58,084 --> 00:42:59,326
I-I didn't do it.

862
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,686
- Do what?
- Whatever.

863
00:43:00,779 --> 00:43:01,621
Ever see this man?

864
00:43:01,646 --> 00:43:03,021
Man... see... picture...

865
00:43:03,209 --> 00:43:04,208
Why are you so nervous?

866
00:43:04,233 --> 00:43:05,233
You got a guilty conscience?

867
00:43:05,278 --> 00:43:06,575
No! Why should I?

868
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,379
Ever see this man?

869
00:43:07,404 --> 00:43:09,223
Man... see... this-this picture...

870
00:43:09,248 --> 00:43:10,497
Dr. Farb.

871
00:43:11,363 --> 00:43:12,933
- So you know him?
- He's my dentist.

872
00:43:12,995 --> 00:43:15,105
He... eh... maybe did something?

873
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:16,824
- He disappeared.
- Blood in his office.

874
00:43:16,849 --> 00:43:17,746
Another man, too.

875
00:43:17,771 --> 00:43:19,511
Blood on the railroad tracks.

876
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:22,989
- Dr. Farb is murdered?
- Is he?

877
00:43:23,091 --> 00:43:25,130
Who knows? Not me!

878
00:43:26,075 --> 00:43:27,075
What do you think?

879
00:43:27,786 --> 00:43:28,904
He doesn't know anything.

880
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:30,318
Ok, Mushnick.

881
00:43:30,505 --> 00:43:32,068
If you hear anything about these men...

882
00:43:32,093 --> 00:43:33,012
...call our office.

883
00:43:33,067 --> 00:43:34,683
Sure, I'll be glad to...

884
00:43:34,731 --> 00:43:36,637
...cooperate with the police.

885
00:43:36,895 --> 00:43:37,895
Hello, aunt Siddie.

886
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,949
Oh, isn't it terrible what
happened to your boy, Frankie?

887
00:43:40,974 --> 00:43:42,489
Those are the breaks.

888
00:43:46,966 --> 00:43:48,005
Alright, Seymour.

889
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:51,645
Now you tell me if this plant
is finished all grown up.

890
00:43:52,138 --> 00:43:54,529
- It's finished all growning up.
- You wouldn't kid your father?

891
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:56,364
- My father came home?
- Me, idiot!

892
00:43:56,389 --> 00:43:57,864
It's a finger of speech.

893
00:43:57,989 --> 00:43:58,989
Now look...

894
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:01,250
I can't stand anymore that plant.

895
00:44:01,275 --> 00:44:03,715
It's growing me out of house and home.

896
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:06,020
It ain't gonna grow anymore. I promise.

897
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:07,637
How can you be so sure?

898
00:44:08,028 --> 00:44:09,629
It ate three times already.

899
00:44:09,925 --> 00:44:11,206
Who...
I mean...

900
00:44:11,386 --> 00:44:13,425
...what did it eat this time?

901
00:44:13,589 --> 00:44:15,995
Well, abou...
about a million Japanese beetles.

902
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,948
So don't eat no more?

903
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:20,159
It's full.

904
00:44:20,253 --> 00:44:21,253
Gravis?

905
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:25,353
There's a lady from some kind
of a committance outside.

906
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,908
I think it's important.

907
00:44:28,134 --> 00:44:29,134
Excellent.

908
00:44:29,205 --> 00:44:30,213
By the by...

909
00:44:30,791 --> 00:44:33,384
...I understand you want to take
Audrey out on a date tonight.

910
00:44:33,807 --> 00:44:35,072
That's very good with me.

911
00:44:35,384 --> 00:44:38,556
Because I am staying to keep an
eye on that meshugana plant.

912
00:44:43,158 --> 00:44:45,002
So, where are we gonna go tonight, Seymour.

913
00:44:45,494 --> 00:44:47,781
I-I-I just remembered:
I don't have any money.

914
00:44:48,463 --> 00:44:49,619
Well, that's ok.

915
00:44:50,009 --> 00:44:52,728
We could take a walk along
the ocean or something.

916
00:44:53,681 --> 00:44:55,978
I got a great idea.
We could eat dinner at my house.

917
00:44:56,063 --> 00:44:58,493
- My mom's a great cook.
- Oh, that's swell!

918
00:44:58,532 --> 00:45:00,423
Oh, boy, I'll call later and tell her.

919
00:45:00,517 --> 00:45:01,306
Ok.

920
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:08,195
Oh, that's remarkable.

921
00:45:08,702 --> 00:45:09,702
You like?

922
00:45:10,829 --> 00:45:13,690
I neither like nor dislike
anything, my goodness.

923
00:45:15,676 --> 00:45:18,028
I happen to represent the society of...

924
00:45:18,314 --> 00:45:21,340
... Silent Flower Observers of Southern California.

925
00:45:21,403 --> 00:45:22,793
How about that?

926
00:45:23,145 --> 00:45:24,145
Tell me...

927
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:27,480
... who created this magnificent bloom?

928
00:45:28,858 --> 00:45:30,233
I did. Me.

929
00:45:30,258 --> 00:45:31,083
Oh.

930
00:45:31,108 --> 00:45:33,303
A-a-and what might your name be?

931
00:45:33,421 --> 00:45:35,272
Seymour Krelborn, with a K.

932
00:45:35,685 --> 00:45:37,490
- Krelboind?
- Krelborn.

933
00:45:38,013 --> 00:45:39,646
Raised in the coffee can.

934
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:41,450
This...

935
00:45:41,685 --> 00:45:42,566
Well...

936
00:45:42,591 --> 00:45:44,349
Tell me, Mr. Krelboind...

937
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,911
Is this a freak or can more
be raised from the seeds?

938
00:45:47,998 --> 00:45:49,153
We should live so long.

939
00:45:49,192 --> 00:45:51,612
Well, I don't think there gonna
be will be any more, Miss, uh,...

940
00:45:51,637 --> 00:45:52,637
Feuchtwanger.

941
00:45:52,661 --> 00:45:54,427
Mrs Hortense Feuchtwanger.

942
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:57,746
I think this is gonna be the only one,
Mrs. Fishswinger.

943
00:45:58,316 --> 00:45:59,316
Feuchtwanger.

944
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:00,981
Feuchtwanger?

945
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,855
Well, it's probably indigestible anyway.

946
00:46:06,014 --> 00:46:07,014
At any rate...

947
00:46:07,686 --> 00:46:10,881
... I have the honour to tell you,
Seymour Krelboind,...

948
00:46:11,381 --> 00:46:14,881
... that you have been selected
to receive the annual trophy...

949
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:18,638
of the Society of Silent Flower
Observers of Southern California.

950
00:46:18,686 --> 00:46:20,084
A trophy? Me?

951
00:46:20,131 --> 00:46:22,217
Such is justice...

952
00:46:22,443 --> 00:46:26,175
But tell me: When do you suppose
those large buds will open?

953
00:46:26,528 --> 00:46:29,520
Well according to what the book says
about the plants that I crossed...

954
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,219
... they should open the day after tomorrow at sunset.

955
00:46:32,346 --> 00:46:33,567
Ah, very well.

956
00:46:33,598 --> 00:46:35,903
Then I shall return at that
time to present the trophy

957
00:46:36,115 --> 00:46:37,115
Good day.

958
00:46:43,895 --> 00:46:45,051
Remarkable.

959
00:46:49,613 --> 00:46:51,668
Oh boy!
I'm gonna get a trophy!

960
00:46:51,699 --> 00:46:53,698
Oh, Seymour. I'm so proud of you.

961
00:46:53,723 --> 00:46:56,526
Oh, a real trophy for Audrey Jr.!

962
00:46:56,551 --> 00:46:58,764
- We'll put it on the float.
- In the rose parade.

963
00:46:58,801 --> 00:47:00,028
Oh, boy!

964
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,847
Don't look at me.
I-I'm a terrible sight.

965
00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:07,777
I-I'm a complete sea hag.

966
00:47:07,948 --> 00:47:09,886
- She always says that.
- O, well, it's true.

967
00:47:09,957 --> 00:47:12,050
I haven't been feelin' very well lately.

968
00:47:12,245 --> 00:47:14,683
Audrey, this is my ma, Winifred Krelborn.

969
00:47:14,729 --> 00:47:16,370
Ma, this is Audrey Fulquard.

970
00:47:16,395 --> 00:47:17,292
She's my girl.

971
00:47:17,317 --> 00:47:19,113
Hi Audrey. Are you hungry?

972
00:47:19,138 --> 00:47:21,145
I sure am. I could eat a horse.

973
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:24,473
Oh. Well, sit right down,
and I'll go get the first course.

974
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:29,348
Sit here, Audrey.

975
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:31,785
You want me to take your sweater?

976
00:47:32,043 --> 00:47:33,317
Well... yeah.

977
00:47:41,732 --> 00:47:42,803
Never mind that.

978
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:44,569
Well, now try this.

979
00:47:51,382 --> 00:47:53,163
It tastes like cough syrup.

980
00:47:53,265 --> 00:47:55,273
Dr. Phlegm's cough syrup

981
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,500
A toast?

982
00:47:57,794 --> 00:48:00,420
- To Audrey Jr.!
- No, to Audrey Sr.!

983
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,277
You! You glutton, you!

984
00:48:26,596 --> 00:48:28,112
Tonight I keep an eye on you.

985
00:48:28,137 --> 00:48:30,761
I don't let nobody get near you.

986
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,618
Coming soup.

987
00:48:44,173 --> 00:48:46,642
No, don't touch it till I
get a little flavouring.

988
00:48:47,806 --> 00:48:48,806
Gee, Audrey.

989
00:48:48,844 --> 00:48:50,620
You sure look good by candlelight.

990
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:52,665
Do I really, Seymour?

991
00:48:52,704 --> 00:48:54,493
- Yes.
- Here you are.

992
00:48:57,375 --> 00:48:58,375
Now try.

993
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:00,578
Sure smells different.

994
00:49:00,664 --> 00:49:01,836
It's different.

995
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:04,711
Some kind of oil, isn't it?

996
00:49:05,045 --> 00:49:06,248
Cod liver oil.

997
00:49:06,802 --> 00:49:08,208
Wonderful for the colon.

998
00:49:08,326 --> 00:49:10,349
And that's sulphur powder on top.

999
00:49:15,669 --> 00:49:18,888
Feed me.

1000
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:25,052
Feed me!

1001
00:49:26,974 --> 00:49:29,178
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

1002
00:49:37,647 --> 00:49:38,647
Open it is.

1003
00:49:38,818 --> 00:49:40,116
<i>Feed me!</i>

1004
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:44,678
I didn't hear it.

1005
00:49:45,069 --> 00:49:46,318
<i>Feed me!</i>

1006
00:49:46,343 --> 00:49:47,343
I heard it.

1007
00:49:48,256 --> 00:49:50,647
I want food.

1008
00:49:51,733 --> 00:49:53,451
A talking plant we got.

1009
00:49:53,592 --> 00:49:55,608
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

1010
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:56,959
No.

1011
00:49:57,358 --> 00:49:58,358
Hungry?

1012
00:49:58,865 --> 00:50:01,108
And other fine kettle von fish!

1013
00:50:01,974 --> 00:50:03,974
Who would you like to have tonight?

1014
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:06,427
You look fat enough.

1015
00:50:08,622 --> 00:50:12,192
We not only got a talking plant,
we got one that makes with smart cracks.

1016
00:50:12,849 --> 00:50:15,903
Will you listen to me, you botanical bum?

1017
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:17,567
Food you wouldn't get.

1018
00:50:17,958 --> 00:50:19,450
Not from Gravis Mushnick.

1019
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,184
I'm starved.

1020
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,411
Excellent.

1021
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:25,146
You would unpopulate all Skid Row.

1022
00:50:25,341 --> 00:50:26,341
Well...

1023
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:28,829
You can forget about it.

1024
00:50:29,223 --> 00:50:31,830
You wouldn't get fed from
Gravis mushnick tonight.

1025
00:50:33,473 --> 00:50:34,473
Good night

1026
00:50:35,051 --> 00:50:36,762
You'll get yours.

1027
00:50:43,949 --> 00:50:45,644
I kinda like this chow mein.

1028
00:50:45,831 --> 00:50:47,308
Uh, if it tastes a little bitter...

1029
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:50,316
... it's because it's made
of Chinese herbs and it's...

1030
00:50:50,527 --> 00:50:52,069
... flavored with accra myosin.

1031
00:50:52,238 --> 00:50:53,238
Epsom salt.

1032
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:56,059
There ain't another cook in
the whole world like my ma.

1033
00:50:56,105 --> 00:50:58,738
That's what your old man said
before the last ran out on me.

1034
00:50:58,808 --> 00:51:01,738
You know, if you're gonna be
married, you gotta be a good cook.

1035
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:03,942
Maybe you could teach me.

1036
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:05,458
You thinkin' to get married?

1037
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:08,638
- He hasn't asked me yet.
- Who hasn't?

1038
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:09,865
Seymour.

1039
00:51:10,091 --> 00:51:11,849
Seymour's too young to get married.

1040
00:51:11,997 --> 00:51:15,235
Look here. A boy's got to go
and play around a little bit.

1041
00:51:15,356 --> 00:51:16,528
Go out on the makin'.

1042
00:51:16,553 --> 00:51:17,623
Have a ball.

1043
00:51:17,856 --> 00:51:20,630
Gee, ma. I don't wanna have a ball.
I wanna be with Audrey.

1044
00:51:20,778 --> 00:51:22,602
- Now look, Seymour.
- Oh, Seymour.

1045
00:51:22,689 --> 00:51:26,252
You promised you wouldn't get married
until you bought me an iron lung.

1046
00:51:26,588 --> 00:51:28,494
You've been breathing for years, ma.

1047
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:29,830
Well, it ain't easy.

1048
00:51:30,041 --> 00:51:31,682
It ain't easy, son.

1049
00:51:53,687 --> 00:51:54,851
Nobody's here.

1050
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,398
Black cats, 13th job...

1051
00:51:57,423 --> 00:51:59,900
Friday 13th. Stupid superstition.

1052
00:52:04,235 --> 00:52:05,235
Alright, you.

1053
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,329
Come out of there.

1054
00:52:06,831 --> 00:52:08,034
Don't shoot, Mister.

1055
00:52:08,455 --> 00:52:11,252
I'm old and sick.
I wouldn't hurt even a fly.

1056
00:52:12,502 --> 00:52:14,219
Come out in the light where I can see you.

1057
00:52:15,798 --> 00:52:16,798
Come on.

1058
00:52:16,823 --> 00:52:17,979
Please don't shoot.

1059
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:19,081
Please.

1060
00:52:19,197 --> 00:52:21,612
Please. I'm only Gravis Mushnick.
You wouldn't want to kill me.

1061
00:52:21,643 --> 00:52:22,843
Where would you hide the body?

1062
00:52:23,245 --> 00:52:25,175
Don't worry. I'm not gonna shoot you.

1063
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:27,244
- Not unless you try something.
- Try something?

1064
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,854
I never tried anything in my life.

1065
00:52:29,167 --> 00:52:31,526
I wouldn't try anything now.
You want my money? Take it.

1066
00:52:31,551 --> 00:52:34,853
You want I should go out and steal you
some more? That's alright, too. I'll do it.

1067
00:52:35,228 --> 00:52:36,603
Thank you very much.

1068
00:52:37,572 --> 00:52:39,642
I like your brand of hospitality.

1069
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:43,110
You'll excuse it isn't more.
I'm only a poor florist

1070
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,135
Yeah, yeah.

1071
00:52:45,336 --> 00:52:46,821
You got about 30 bucks here.

1072
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,039
Come on now. Where's the rest of it?

1073
00:52:49,179 --> 00:52:52,406
I was in here this afternoon.
I saw about 30,000 people in here...

1074
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:53,921
They must have spent some money. Where is it?

1075
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,156
There ain't no more money.
They came in to look on the plant.

1076
00:52:56,181 --> 00:52:58,265
It's a big attraction.
Audrey Jr.

1077
00:52:58,681 --> 00:52:59,720
The plant. Don't try to snow me, Jim.

1078
00:52:59,745 --> 00:53:01,845
30,000 square didn't come
in just to look for a plant.

1079
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:02,869
I want it!

1080
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,289
I don't got no more money.
Honest. Believe me.

1081
00:53:06,336 --> 00:53:07,414
Ok, let's try this.

1082
00:53:07,656 --> 00:53:08,656
One...

1083
00:53:08,867 --> 00:53:09,867
Two...

1084
00:53:09,938 --> 00:53:10,938
Three...

1085
00:53:11,084 --> 00:53:13,423
- Four...
- I ain't got no more money, honest!

1086
00:53:13,654 --> 00:53:15,997
Alright. Try it the other way around.
Five...

1087
00:53:16,053 --> 00:53:17,053
Four...

1088
00:53:17,091 --> 00:53:18,091
Three...

1089
00:53:18,139 --> 00:53:19,217
- Two...
- Alright.

1090
00:53:19,242 --> 00:53:20,310
Alright.

1091
00:53:20,429 --> 00:53:21,757
Alright, big bad. Where?

1092
00:53:23,515 --> 00:53:24,718
In the plant.

1093
00:53:25,495 --> 00:53:26,754
In the plant?

1094
00:53:27,443 --> 00:53:29,402
The big plant, Audrey Jr.

1095
00:53:32,791 --> 00:53:34,299
I-inside the big leaf?

1096
00:53:34,487 --> 00:53:36,183
That's right. Inside.

1097
00:53:37,267 --> 00:53:39,120
H-h-how do you get it open?

1098
00:53:40,815 --> 00:53:41,815
Just knock.

1099
00:53:58,274 --> 00:53:59,274
In there?

1100
00:53:59,299 --> 00:54:00,299
In there.

1101
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,071
Inside.

1102
00:54:02,328 --> 00:54:03,468
In the bottom.

1103
00:54:03,493 --> 00:54:04,696
I don't see anything.

1104
00:54:06,249 --> 00:54:07,609
Way inside.

1105
00:54:08,141 --> 00:54:09,477
Right at the bottom.

1106
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:24,230
Argh!

1107
00:54:28,927 --> 00:54:30,502
Oi, what I did?

1108
00:54:34,425 --> 00:54:37,198
I don't care about you got
a date with Audrey tonight.

1109
00:54:37,223 --> 00:54:40,175
I am no more sitting up
with that no-goodnik plant.

1110
00:54:42,503 --> 00:54:45,159
But, see, Mr. Mushnick,
you don't have to sit up with it any more.

1111
00:54:45,184 --> 00:54:46,847
- It's all grown up now.
- Excellent.

1112
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:50,050
Smart guy. How do you know
it don't be hungry no more?

1113
00:54:50,075 --> 00:54:52,398
- Well because...
- Tonight you are staying!

1114
00:54:52,563 --> 00:54:55,024
Then tomorrow they are coming and
they are going to give you a trophy...

1115
00:54:55,049 --> 00:54:59,117
... and then after that we are getting
rid once and for all for that plant!

1116
00:54:59,281 --> 00:55:02,328
- Getting rid of it? Why?
- Don't ask. Why? Why?

1117
00:55:02,405 --> 00:55:04,280
The end. Into the garbage can.

1118
00:55:04,305 --> 00:55:05,757
Aloha.

1119
00:55:05,843 --> 00:55:08,078
Oi.
Yes, Mrs. Shiva?

1120
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,320
Oh, Seymour.

1121
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:11,029
Your wonderful plant!

1122
00:55:11,054 --> 00:55:12,468
Oh, that's alright, Audrey.

1123
00:55:12,546 --> 00:55:14,898
I'll grow other plants,
even more wonderful ones.

1124
00:55:15,171 --> 00:55:16,499
I know you will.

1125
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,124
Did you figure out what
we're doing tonight?

1126
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,467
Yeah we're going to place
full of beautiful flowers.

1127
00:55:22,932 --> 00:55:24,885
- We have to stay here.
- Yeah.

1128
00:55:25,205 --> 00:55:27,598
Well, never mind. We'll have a picnic.

1129
00:55:27,682 --> 00:55:29,510
It'll be just like going to the country.

1130
00:55:29,611 --> 00:55:30,925
- Oh, boy!
<i>- ...flowers and...</i>

1131
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:32,502
<i>... and pink azaleas, for the arbour,...</i>

1132
00:55:32,527 --> 00:55:35,392
- ... and the 9000 yellow mons for the...
- For the border.

1133
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:38,578
- And the... the roses
- I got them around the back.

1134
00:55:39,996 --> 00:55:43,580
What do you mean you're going to a
picnic at night with that Fulquard girl?

1135
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,261
Don't you like Audrey, ma?

1136
00:55:45,339 --> 00:55:46,788
She's out after your money.

1137
00:55:47,034 --> 00:55:48,308
I don't have any money.

1138
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:50,295
Oh, she's a smart one.

1139
00:55:50,495 --> 00:55:54,542
She'll latch onto ya till ya get
some and then goodbye, fortune!

1140
00:55:54,761 --> 00:55:56,636
But Audrey's honest girl, ma.

1141
00:55:56,698 --> 00:55:59,597
Yeah, never trust a woman who's too healthy

1142
00:55:59,971 --> 00:56:02,283
But Audrey had a bad cold a few weeks ago.

1143
00:56:02,354 --> 00:56:04,698
Oh, cold, a puny cold.

1144
00:56:04,955 --> 00:56:07,065
Why don't you get yourself
a real female with...

1145
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:08,487
... something decent like...

1146
00:56:08,512 --> 00:56:11,133
... pneumonoconiosis, or-or gall stones?

1147
00:56:11,188 --> 00:56:13,088
Well, maybe she could
catch something like that.

1148
00:56:13,113 --> 00:56:15,598
The only thing she'll catch is you.

1149
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:18,980
And she'll take you off to
some shady sanatorium...

1150
00:56:19,005 --> 00:56:22,334
... and leave me to
chiropractors and faith healers.

1151
00:56:22,919 --> 00:56:24,840
I know when I'm not wanted.

1152
00:56:25,919 --> 00:56:27,512
Oh, gee, ma.

1153
00:56:27,537 --> 00:56:29,341
Don't feel sorry for me.

1154
00:56:30,068 --> 00:56:32,825
I'll just find a nice,
wet alley somewhere...

1155
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:34,896
... and curl up and wait for the end.

1156
00:56:35,154 --> 00:56:37,763
Oh, please don't die till I get
back, will you ma?

1157
00:56:37,841 --> 00:56:40,333
I'll take care of you.
I'll always take care of you, I promise!

1158
00:56:40,358 --> 00:56:41,763
- Yeah.
- Bye.

1159
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:50,404
Gee, Audrey, I've never
tasted food like this before.

1160
00:56:50,795 --> 00:56:53,013
It's a peanut butter and jelly sandwich

1161
00:56:53,146 --> 00:56:55,058
Peanut butter and jelly -
what does that cure?

1162
00:56:55,575 --> 00:56:57,354
Nothing. It's just a food.

1163
00:56:57,441 --> 00:56:59,331
What good is it if it
doesn't clear up pimples...

1164
00:56:59,356 --> 00:57:01,348
... or shrink your sinus
tissues or something?

1165
00:57:01,449 --> 00:57:03,629
You're just being silly, Seymour.

1166
00:57:04,996 --> 00:57:07,130
Seymour, what do you wanna be?

1167
00:57:07,902 --> 00:57:09,582
Oh, I wanna grow things.

1168
00:57:09,963 --> 00:57:12,019
If I had a lot of money,
I'd go to the South Seas,..

1169
00:57:12,044 --> 00:57:14,417
... where they grow the most
fabulous plants in the world.

1170
00:57:14,511 --> 00:57:16,065
That sounds exciting.

1171
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:17,410
Yeah.

1172
00:57:17,435 --> 00:57:19,855
I'd like to go to the South Seas, too.

1173
00:57:19,956 --> 00:57:21,846
There's no reason why you couldn't go.

1174
00:57:22,494 --> 00:57:24,429
Would you take me with you, Seymour?

1175
00:57:24,494 --> 00:57:27,198
Oh, I couldn't very well
go without you, Audrey.

1176
00:57:27,456 --> 00:57:28,456
Why not?

1177
00:57:28,979 --> 00:57:29,979
Because...

1178
00:57:30,214 --> 00:57:31,768
Because I'm in love with you, Audrey.

1179
00:57:32,026 --> 00:57:34,135
Oh, I'm in love with you, too, Seymour.

1180
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,361
<i>Feed me.</i>

1181
00:57:37,345 --> 00:57:38,345
What'd you say?

1182
00:57:38,525 --> 00:57:39,900
I'm...
I'm just kidding.

1183
00:57:40,971 --> 00:57:42,752
<i>I'm hungry!</i>

1184
00:57:42,784 --> 00:57:43,784
Seymour!

1185
00:57:43,955 --> 00:57:46,369
- I didn't mean it.
- Why did you say it?

1186
00:57:46,525 --> 00:57:49,088
<i>Oh.
Food.</i>

1187
00:57:49,697 --> 00:57:50,994
You didn't even say that.

1188
00:57:51,019 --> 00:57:52,744
Oh yes I did.
I said it. I said it.

1189
00:57:52,783 --> 00:57:54,533
Oh, I'm looking right at you.

1190
00:57:54,876 --> 00:57:56,869
Well, I'm a ventriloquist.

1191
00:57:56,988 --> 00:57:57,805
You're what?

1192
00:57:57,830 --> 00:57:59,946
- A ventrilo...
<i>- Feed me!</i>

1193
00:58:00,774 --> 00:58:02,470
Seymour, do you feel all right?

1194
00:58:02,495 --> 00:58:04,547
Well, I don't know.
I'm not sure.

1195
00:58:04,735 --> 00:58:07,517
Well, then stop all this
nonsense and kiss me.

1196
00:58:08,423 --> 00:58:10,673
<i>I'm dying from hunger!</i>

1197
00:58:10,698 --> 00:58:13,344
Alright, if you're so
hungry, eat something but...

1198
00:58:13,547 --> 00:58:14,649
... forget about me.

1199
00:58:14,817 --> 00:58:15,817
Gee, I'm sorry, Audrey.

1200
00:58:15,842 --> 00:58:17,662
<i>Give me to eat!</i>

1201
00:58:17,701 --> 00:58:20,185
If you can't control
yourself, I'm going home.

1202
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:22,334
<i>I need some chow.</i>

1203
00:58:24,468 --> 00:58:26,827
Ooh, my empty stomach.

1204
00:58:28,109 --> 00:58:30,414
Audrey, please wait.
Listen to me.

1205
00:58:30,508 --> 00:58:33,430
I've listened to all the
nonsense I wanna hear, Seymour.

1206
00:58:33,664 --> 00:58:34,727
You're a nut.

1207
00:58:34,801 --> 00:58:38,279
You tell me that you love me and then
you you act like a complete idiot.

1208
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,820
Please listen, Audrey.

1209
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:42,000
I'll be able to explain everything soon.

1210
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:44,095
Why can't you explain now?

1211
00:58:44,697 --> 00:58:46,806
Because so many things are so important.

1212
00:58:47,283 --> 00:58:48,423
I wanna marry you.

1213
00:58:48,548 --> 00:58:50,368
But I gotta take care of mom.

1214
00:58:50,595 --> 00:58:53,204
Well, that plant in there is
gonna make it all come true.

1215
00:58:53,958 --> 00:58:56,458
Tomorrow they're gonna give me
a trophy and I'll be famous.

1216
00:58:56,591 --> 00:58:58,099
I'll be a big botanist.

1217
00:58:58,552 --> 00:59:01,231
And then we can go to the South
Seas just like we planned and all.

1218
00:59:01,256 --> 00:59:04,349
But that doesn't have anything
to do with what went on in there.

1219
00:59:05,052 --> 00:59:07,388
When you're ready to come to your
senses, Seymour,...

1220
00:59:07,716 --> 00:59:09,115
... then I'll talk to you.

1221
00:59:09,778 --> 00:59:10,949
Good night, Seymour.

1222
00:59:19,662 --> 00:59:21,271
<i>Feed.</i>

1223
00:59:22,122 --> 00:59:23,802
I'm getting pretty tired of you.

1224
00:59:24,006 --> 00:59:25,912
I need food.

1225
00:59:25,951 --> 00:59:27,224
I don't care what you need.

1226
00:59:27,287 --> 00:59:28,498
Look what you've done to me.

1227
00:59:28,568 --> 00:59:31,404
You not only made a butcher outta
me, you drove my girl away.

1228
00:59:31,450 --> 00:59:33,982
Shut up, and bring on the food!

1229
00:59:34,426 --> 00:59:36,278
Don't tell me to shut up - you shut up!

1230
00:59:37,044 --> 00:59:38,847
Who raised you from a
bunch of little seeds?

1231
00:59:39,004 --> 00:59:42,859
Who fed you all them high-class fertilizers
and sat up with you when you were sick?

1232
00:59:43,223 --> 00:59:45,012
Nodody else would have done that for you.

1233
00:59:45,073 --> 00:59:48,011
You think anybody else would have
brought you human beings to eat?

1234
00:59:48,362 --> 00:59:49,714
Darm right, they wouldn't.

1235
00:59:50,077 --> 00:59:52,756
Well, I've helped you and you've helped me.

1236
00:59:52,781 --> 00:59:55,031
Now shut your trap and go to sleep.
I'm tired.

1237
00:59:55,187 --> 00:59:56,187
<i>Krelborn!</i>

1238
00:59:56,905 --> 00:59:57,905
Turn around!

1239
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,764
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

1240
01:00:03,538 --> 01:00:05,210
<i>You are asleep.</i>

1241
01:00:06,444 --> 01:00:07,780
Open your eyes.

1242
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:11,322
Now you will do as I say.

1243
01:00:11,405 --> 01:00:12,756
Will you follow me?

1244
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:14,038
Yes, master.

1245
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:18,646
You will go out and
find me some food!

1246
01:00:18,959 --> 01:00:20,185
Yes, master.

1247
01:00:20,326 --> 01:00:21,771
<i>Now begone.</i>

1248
01:00:22,192 --> 01:00:23,864
<i>And waste no time.</i>

1249
01:00:44,551 --> 01:00:45,551
<i>Idiot!</i>

1250
01:01:25,995 --> 01:01:27,995
My name is Leonora Clyde.

1251
01:01:28,665 --> 01:01:30,581
How's the rain on the rhubarb?

1252
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,706
Master is hungry.

1253
01:01:43,392 --> 01:01:44,759
Well, hello there.

1254
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:17,460
I gotta find food for master.

1255
01:02:18,187 --> 01:02:20,210
Food I gotta find for master.

1256
01:02:21,147 --> 01:02:23,716
For master I gotta find food.

1257
01:02:24,897 --> 01:02:26,420
Maybe I can help.

1258
01:02:27,264 --> 01:02:29,935
- Who're you?
- My name is Leonora Clyde.

1259
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,365
I love you.

1260
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:34,366
Master wants food.

1261
01:02:34,765 --> 01:02:36,413
Let the old goat wait.

1262
01:02:36,491 --> 01:02:38,827
The night is young and so are we.

1263
01:02:39,069 --> 01:02:40,757
Master doesn't eat goat.

1264
01:02:45,308 --> 01:02:48,089
Well what kind of food does he like?

1265
01:02:50,855 --> 01:02:51,987
Oooh.

1266
01:02:52,777 --> 01:02:54,192
That's more like it.

1267
01:02:54,217 --> 01:02:55,217
Kiss me!

1268
01:02:59,122 --> 01:03:01,059
What's the matter, don't you like me?

1269
01:03:01,333 --> 01:03:02,575
Too bony.

1270
01:03:02,613 --> 01:03:03,719
Too bony?

1271
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,292
Nobody ever told me that before.

1272
01:03:05,317 --> 01:03:07,152
Beef is better than veal.

1273
01:03:07,848 --> 01:03:08,848
Ach.

1274
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,395
You're such a dodo.

1275
01:03:10,511 --> 01:03:12,863
What do you call this?
Chopped liver?

1276
01:03:13,754 --> 01:03:14,754
Mmm.

1277
01:03:15,339 --> 01:03:16,738
Haha.

1278
01:03:17,074 --> 01:03:19,121
Master would like more fat.

1279
01:03:19,394 --> 01:03:21,315
Speak for yourself, John.

1280
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:24,639
My name is Seymour.

1281
01:03:24,752 --> 01:03:26,393
"My name is Seymour."

1282
01:03:26,651 --> 01:03:28,003
That's my name, too.

1283
01:03:28,893 --> 01:03:32,221
Ach. Are you interested are
you just wasting my time?

1284
01:03:32,573 --> 01:03:34,745
I never thought anybody would volunteer.

1285
01:03:34,886 --> 01:03:36,050
Do you volunteer?

1286
01:03:36,144 --> 01:03:37,480
Sure I do.

1287
01:03:38,042 --> 01:03:40,674
Alright, if you're sure
you want to... volunteer.

1288
01:03:41,057 --> 01:03:43,159
Alright. My place or yours?

1289
01:03:43,321 --> 01:03:44,415
I don't care.

1290
01:03:44,721 --> 01:03:46,667
Well,...
flip a coin.

1291
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:48,448
I don't have a coin.

1292
01:03:48,995 --> 01:03:50,635
Flip anything, silly.

1293
01:03:51,285 --> 01:03:52,690
Well, there's a rock.

1294
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:56,822
Wet or dry?

1295
01:03:56,901 --> 01:03:57,901
Wet.

1296
01:04:15,869 --> 01:04:16,962
<i>The search was narrowing...</i>

1297
01:04:17,197 --> 01:04:19,228
<i>... and we knew that soon
we would have the killer.</i>

1298
01:04:19,751 --> 01:04:21,782
<i>Not that we had any more clues than before.</i>

1299
01:04:21,892 --> 01:04:23,517
<i>But we had to tell the chief something.</i>

1300
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:26,765
<i>I had that feeling in my bones that the
mystery was frawing to its climax.</i>

1301
01:04:26,852 --> 01:04:28,665
<i>And I was determined to be on hand.</i>

1302
01:04:29,719 --> 01:04:31,015
Alright.
Out, out, out.

1303
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,047
Nobody is in.

1304
01:04:32,072 --> 01:04:34,625
Today we have a special
occasion for Seymour Krelborn...

1305
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:36,515
... which has invented a big plant.

1306
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:39,001
So I want everybody just please
stay out of the way.

1307
01:04:39,026 --> 01:04:42,258
We want Seymour!
We want Seymour!

1308
01:04:42,282 --> 01:04:43,978
We want Seymour!

1309
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:54,047
I tell you, this business is worse than
being a conductor in a revoluting door.

1310
01:04:54,103 --> 01:04:56,204
I'll be glad when this day is finished.

1311
01:04:56,229 --> 01:04:57,385
But the celebration!

1312
01:04:57,410 --> 01:04:59,775
They're presenting my son with a trophy.

1313
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:01,557
Yeah? What'd he do -
run away from home?

1314
01:05:01,869 --> 01:05:03,713
Please don't look at me that way, Audrey.

1315
01:05:03,854 --> 01:05:05,088
I wanna talk to you.

1316
01:05:05,432 --> 01:05:06,736
I'm sorry Seymour.

1317
01:05:07,401 --> 01:05:09,057
I just don't understand you.

1318
01:05:09,082 --> 01:05:11,135
I'll explain everything after the ceremony.

1319
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,074
Yo! Police - what are you doing here?

1320
01:05:13,099 --> 01:05:14,777
Heard there was something
going on here this evening.

1321
01:05:14,802 --> 01:05:16,644
Just so, we'd keep come by,
keep an eye on things

1322
01:05:16,669 --> 01:05:19,240
Look we don't need no eyes kept on nothing.
Everything...

1323
01:05:19,265 --> 01:05:22,123
The Society Of Silent Flower
Observers has arrived...

1324
01:05:22,148 --> 01:05:24,308
and sunset is almost upon us.

1325
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:26,288
Welcome, lady and gentlemen.

1326
01:05:26,351 --> 01:05:28,586
We are honoured for to have you.

1327
01:05:29,476 --> 01:05:30,976
Still working on those disappearances.

1328
01:05:31,132 --> 01:05:32,187
We think they were murdered.

1329
01:05:32,212 --> 01:05:33,578
Hey, look here young man.

1330
01:05:33,603 --> 01:05:35,462
That's no way to talk at a time like this.

1331
01:05:35,525 --> 01:05:36,775
Let me see your tongue.

1332
01:05:37,329 --> 01:05:38,392
M-hm.

1333
01:05:38,422 --> 01:05:39,494
You know what you got?

1334
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:40,587
Just the facts, ma'am.

1335
01:05:40,652 --> 01:05:41,452
Trench mouth.

1336
01:05:41,597 --> 01:05:43,323
Oh, I know, I had it back in '09.

1337
01:05:43,348 --> 01:05:45,828
- Better have that looked into, Frank.
- Whatever you say, Joe.

1338
01:05:47,144 --> 01:05:48,402
Mr. Krelborn?

1339
01:05:48,529 --> 01:05:51,513
Uh, the sun is going down now
and, uh...

1340
01:05:52,208 --> 01:05:54,640
... you do think those
buds are going to open?

1341
01:05:55,021 --> 01:05:56,138
I hope so.

1342
01:05:56,184 --> 01:05:58,825
Because if they don't, Mr. Krelborn,...

1343
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:01,660
... we shall just have to present
the award at another time.

1344
01:06:01,832 --> 01:06:04,160
Oh! It's starting to open!

1345
01:06:05,707 --> 01:06:06,707
<i>Remarkable!</i>

1346
01:06:08,879 --> 01:06:11,676
Oh. Well, the first bud is open.

1347
01:06:16,917 --> 01:06:18,519
- Isn't that...
- The railroad cop.

1348
01:06:18,745 --> 01:06:19,761
Look at the rest.

1349
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,859
Aaaah!

1350
01:06:32,968 --> 01:06:33,968
What do you think, Frank?

1351
01:06:34,001 --> 01:06:35,323
They're all there, Joe.

1352
01:06:35,548 --> 01:06:36,548
Yes, you're right.

1353
01:06:36,672 --> 01:06:38,703
Mr. Krelborn,
how do you explain this?

1354
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:40,251
I didn't mean it.
I didn't mean it!

1355
01:06:40,276 --> 01:06:42,509
That's right, officer.
He didn't mean to kill them.

1356
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:43,533
Oh!

1357
01:06:43,626 --> 01:06:46,072
Seymour, you promised you'd explain.

1358
01:06:46,532 --> 01:06:47,821
He's getting away, Joe.

1359
01:06:47,846 --> 01:06:49,915
Yes, you're right.
Let's catch him.

1360
01:06:50,117 --> 01:06:51,117
Right.

1361
01:06:55,968 --> 01:06:59,210
- Oh, now the float will be perfect!
- Yeah.

1362
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,990
You wouldn't find him
here with the toilets.

1363
01:10:13,155 --> 01:10:14,561
Let's go back.

1364
01:10:37,005 --> 01:10:40,065
You dirty rat plant.
You messed up my whole life!

1365
01:10:40,397 --> 01:10:43,811
Feed meeeee!

1366
01:10:44,155 --> 01:10:45,561
I'll feed you.

1367
01:10:49,262 --> 01:10:51,895
I'll feed you like you've
never been fed before.

1368
01:11:14,693 --> 01:11:16,411
Better to give up, gentlemen.

1369
01:11:17,169 --> 01:11:18,895
You wouldn't find him tonight.

1370
01:11:18,926 --> 01:11:20,965
Fuck.
The door is open, Frank.

1371
01:11:27,659 --> 01:11:29,665
He was such a good boy.

1372
01:11:33,573 --> 01:11:35,081
Seymour!

1373
01:11:35,479 --> 01:11:37,042
I didn't mean it.
