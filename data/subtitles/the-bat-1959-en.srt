1
00:01:08,703 --> 00:01:13,029
This is the Oaks, a house in the
country which I rented for the summer.

2
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:17,325
As an author, I write
tales of mystery and murder.

3
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:21,411
But the things that happened in this
house were far more fantastic...

4
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:23,792
than any story I've ever had published.

5
00:01:24,456 --> 00:01:27,771
I brought a staff of
servants from my city apartment...

6
00:01:28,269 --> 00:01:32,007
and my maid Lizzy Allen who
had been with me nearly 20 years.

7
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:36,937
Lizzy?

8
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,881
- Yes, Miss Cornelia?
- Is the car ready?

9
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:43,254
It's at the door.

10
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:46,042
Look. Miss Cornelia...

11
00:01:46,238 --> 00:01:49,947
them servants you brought from the apartment
are talking about walking out on us.

12
00:01:50,294 --> 00:01:51,696
Really?

13
00:01:52,631 --> 00:01:56,837
Oh, I know they don't like it here
but I didn't think it was that bad.

14
00:01:56,867 --> 00:02:00,635
Well, they've been hearing things about
the killer that the police call the Bat,

15
00:02:00,665 --> 00:02:03,771
And the murders that he
committed here this past winter.

16
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:07,088
Now people are saying that he's back again.

17
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:11,234
Well, how can they be sure of that?
Has he committed another crime?

18
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:14,114
No, not yet, but that
ain't saying that he won't.

19
00:02:14,974 --> 00:02:15,984
Here's something else.

20
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,808
You've heard about the bats they have
here, animal bats, the kind that fly.

21
00:02:20,838 --> 00:02:23,838
- Yes, yes.
- Look what it says in this magazine.

22
00:02:23,868 --> 00:02:26,084
This is a report from the
state Health Department...

23
00:02:26,114 --> 00:02:28,873
and it says some of them bats is rabid.

24
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,100
- Well?
- And that ain't all.

25
00:02:32,522 --> 00:02:36,080
And now there's a rumor going
around that it was the Bat himself...

26
00:02:36,261 --> 00:02:39,849
the killer I mean, that released the
rabid bats in this neighborhood.

27
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:42,276
Oh, that's ridiculous.

28
00:02:42,775 --> 00:02:47,899
Well, the housekeeper, the cook, the
butler and the upstairs maid don't think so.

29
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:49,995
Well, I can't help what they think.

30
00:02:50,402 --> 00:02:54,457
If hysterical nonsense like that
can scare them out of their good jobs...

31
00:02:54,638 --> 00:02:56,748
it's their loss not mine.

32
00:02:56,778 --> 00:02:59,266
Come on Lizzy, I've got to get to the bank.

33
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:07,299
Drive directly to Zenith Bank Warner.

34
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:10,014
I'm afraid we'll have
to hurry, it's near closing time.

35
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:11,718
I'll get you there Miss Van Gorder.

36
00:03:24,457 --> 00:03:25,724
Thanks again.

37
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:29,275
- Miss Van Gorder!
- How are you doing Mr. Bailey?

38
00:03:29,305 --> 00:03:31,367
- How are you?
- I'm very well, thank you.

39
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:33,027
You remember Lizzy Allen?

40
00:03:33,057 --> 00:03:35,164
- Of course, hello Miss Allen.
- How do you do?

41
00:03:35,494 --> 00:03:39,047
- So you're spending the summer with us again?
- Yes, yes, I've leased the Oaks.,

42
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,571
The home of your bank president John Fleming.

43
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:43,851
I heard you had, I was surprised.

44
00:03:43,881 --> 00:03:45,782
Why? Is there something the matter with it?

45
00:03:45,812 --> 00:03:49,109
No, I was surprised because
Mr. Fleming said he would never rent it.

46
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:50,042
Oh?

47
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:54,914
Well I rented it from his nephew Mark
Fleming who has the real estate office here.

48
00:03:55,078 --> 00:03:57,856
He said his uncle would
be gone the entire summer.

49
00:03:57,991 --> 00:03:58,879
That's right.

50
00:03:59,256 --> 00:04:02,652
Mr. Fleming is in the north woods
now with his physician Dr. Wells.

51
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,633
Oh, pard me, Dale.

52
00:04:05,942 --> 00:04:08,383
I want you to meet my wife.
We were married at Christmas time.

53
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:10,506
- That must've been nice.
- Believe me, it was.

54
00:04:10,536 --> 00:04:13,970
Oh, here she is, my wife,
Miss Van Gorder, Miss Allen.

55
00:04:14,115 --> 00:04:16,710
- How do you do Miss Bailey?
- How do you do?

56
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,045
- Cornelia Van Gorder.
- Yes.

57
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:22,469
Oh, well I've read every murder
mystery you've ever written.

58
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:25,991
I just adored that weird one,
the private morgue of Dr. X.

59
00:04:26,445 --> 00:04:30,782
- Even though it gave me the shivers.
- Only the shivers? Scared hell out of me.

60
00:04:32,095 --> 00:04:36,418
Well, I, I, I really means that Miss
Corny killed them off in that one.

61
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,359
When you refer to my books,
please don't call me Miss Corny.

62
00:04:40,812 --> 00:04:43,157
Pard me, Mr. Bailey,
Mr. Hynes is here to see you.

63
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:45,511
Oh yes, excuse me please.

64
00:04:46,248 --> 00:04:48,977
- Don't be strangers now.
- No, no we won't.

65
00:04:49,007 --> 00:04:51,962
Oh, so you're a bride?

66
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:55,248
- No, not quite.
- Not since Christmas.

67
00:04:55,278 --> 00:04:57,343
You know, I'm sure I've seen you.

68
00:04:57,373 --> 00:05:00,418
Well I, I used to be my
husband's secretary here in the bank.

69
00:05:00,448 --> 00:05:02,951
Of course, I remember.

70
00:05:04,278 --> 00:05:07,429
May I welcome our most
distinguished visitor back to Zenith?

71
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:10,700
Oh, that's very charming, but...

72
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:16,535
- Lieutenant Anderson.
- Lieutenant Anderson, of course.

73
00:05:17,048 --> 00:05:20,636
Chief of detectives of the Zenith police
department, This is Miss Allen.

74
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,355
- Miss Allen.
- How do you do?

75
00:05:22,385 --> 00:05:26,786
Lt. Anderson is one of our favorite citizens,
he's on the Bank's board of directors.

76
00:05:27,481 --> 00:05:30,812
- Not bad for a policeman.
- You must've made a good thing of it.

77
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,362
Well, I saved my money,
if that's what you mean.

78
00:05:34,392 --> 00:05:38,517
It's near closing time and I've got some
business in the safe deposit vault.

79
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:41,366
- Please come and see me Miss Bailey.
- Oh, I'd love to.

80
00:05:41,396 --> 00:05:42,573
- And you Lieutenant.
- Thank you.

81
00:05:42,603 --> 00:05:44,940
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, nice to have met you.

82
00:05:46,704 --> 00:05:50,624
My, what a charming woman, she
moved into the Oaks just the other day.

83
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,835
That house is a proper
sitting for a writer of mysteries.

84
00:05:53,865 --> 00:05:56,006
Oh, it certainly is.

85
00:05:58,448 --> 00:06:02,503
- Dick, what's the matter?
- Come in here, both of you.

86
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:14,308
Andy, we're in trouble. Wendell Hynes came
in to pick up $350,000 worth of bonds that...

87
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:16,615
we were holding as collateral for a loan.

88
00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:18,906
They were kept in our special vault.

89
00:06:19,222 --> 00:06:23,021
Mr. Fleming and I are the only officers
of the bank who have access to that vault.

90
00:06:23,051 --> 00:06:26,323
- So?
- The Hynes bonds are gone.

91
00:06:27,122 --> 00:06:30,650
That's not all, other
negotiable securities are missing.

92
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,348
From what I can gather
short of a careful check...

93
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,238
the bank is been looted of over
a million dollars worth of securities.

94
00:06:37,615 --> 00:06:39,258
You'll have to notify Fleming.

95
00:06:40,313 --> 00:06:44,942
I wish I could talk to him. Unfortunately,
he and Dr. Wells are deep in the woods.

96
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,640
They can't be reached by phone.

97
00:07:00,091 --> 00:07:01,161
What is it?

98
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:12,437
I thought I heard someone
on the path coming from the lake.

99
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:16,269
- Had an idea it might be that guide of ours.
- Oh, Sam won't show up until morning.

100
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:18,979
It's a 20 mile canoe trip
from here to civilization.

101
00:07:19,696 --> 00:07:22,591
Five will get you 10,
Sam has a message for me.

102
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,346
I thought you told them at
the bank not to bother you.

103
00:07:25,508 --> 00:07:27,692
I did, but they'll bother me.

104
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:33,003
- Doctor?
- Yes, John.

105
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,484
What would you do for half a million?

106
00:07:37,503 --> 00:07:39,085
Anything short of murder.

107
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:41,069
Why not murder?

108
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:43,084
Too messy.

109
00:07:43,739 --> 00:07:44,766
Too great a risk?

110
00:07:44,974 --> 00:07:46,580
For half a million? Yes.

111
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,438
I pinched a million from the bank.

112
00:07:52,523 --> 00:07:53,581
I'm not kidding.

113
00:07:54,376 --> 00:07:55,287
I embezzled it.

114
00:07:56,337 --> 00:07:59,439
Not that I think you wouldn't do it
if you thought you could get away with it.

115
00:08:00,697 --> 00:08:01,886
I got away with it.

116
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:05,058
I'm not talking about currency.

117
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,303
I took negotiable securities that
could be converted into cash.

118
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:13,757
I have the cash, in tens,
twenties, and hundreds.

119
00:08:14,636 --> 00:08:17,284
And I'm your doctor,
not your lawyer, why tell me this?

120
00:08:18,273 --> 00:08:19,694
You'll find out why.

121
00:08:21,276 --> 00:08:22,998
Who's going to take the
blame for the robbery?

122
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:26,162
Bailey, the cashier,
they'll never suspect me.

123
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:30,168
- I like Bailey.
- Oh, so do I, I love the guy.

124
00:08:30,615 --> 00:08:33,648
- I gave him his first chance.
- He has a lovely little wife.

125
00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:37,168
Charming girl, was the best man.

126
00:08:37,547 --> 00:08:38,674
Where's the million?

127
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:44,031
In my family's tomb in Zenith,
in the crypt with my father's casket.

128
00:08:46,006 --> 00:08:49,664
- I don't buy that John.
- No?

129
00:08:50,106 --> 00:08:50,839
No.

130
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,346
You forget that I had you in
charge when you were a very sick man.

131
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,218
When you raved in delirium.

132
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,791
And I heard you talk about a hidden room.

133
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:05,612
Now, where else could you put a hidden
room except in that mansion you built.

134
00:09:06,191 --> 00:09:08,908
That white elephant you call the Oaks?

135
00:09:09,688 --> 00:09:13,528
Look, everyone knows I have a bad heart.

136
00:09:15,025 --> 00:09:19,317
Who would doubt it if you wired the
bank directors that my heart is failed.

137
00:09:19,857 --> 00:09:25,228
That I'd fallen from a great height here in
the woods and that I was badly smashed up?

138
00:09:26,036 --> 00:09:28,954
You could ship
the body back for burial and...

139
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:33,091
instruct them not to open the casket
due to the condition of its contents.

140
00:09:34,056 --> 00:09:38,507
Well you realize, of course, that we
had to have a body to put in that casket.

141
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:41,504
Which means that we'd have to
deal with an undertaker at this end.

142
00:09:41,534 --> 00:09:44,586
- Of course.
- But where do we get a body?

143
00:09:46,238 --> 00:09:50,109
Couldn't we provide
one of our own? How about Sam?

144
00:09:51,013 --> 00:09:52,629
Sam, our guide?

145
00:09:53,015 --> 00:09:56,706
Sam weighs about as much
as I do, he's practically a hermit.

146
00:09:57,116 --> 00:09:59,094
He wouldn't be missed for a long time.

147
00:10:00,806 --> 00:10:02,591
The local undertaker would know him.

148
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,414
Not if we made him look as
if he'd been in a serious accident.

149
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,201
But if Bailey is going to take the
blame, why do you have to do this?

150
00:10:10,707 --> 00:10:14,458
A jury might acquit him.
In that case, I'd be a logical suspect.

151
00:10:15,242 --> 00:10:19,583
I could disappear of course,
but it's safer if they think I'm dead.

152
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:26,362
What if I don't go for this deal?

153
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,788
In that case, it would be two bad.

154
00:10:35,117 --> 00:10:38,820
- You mean you'd kill me?
- What else could I do?

155
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:43,680
Now that I've told you about the million.
I'd say you were shot in a hunting accident.

156
00:10:44,404 --> 00:10:45,525
Now look doctor...

157
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,927
if you can find another body
instead of Sam's, it's all right with me.

158
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,171
There's half a million in it for you.

159
00:10:54,257 --> 00:10:55,608
I'll do my best.

160
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:01,276
- I smell smoke.
- So do I, what's that noise?

161
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:08,060
Look doctor, the woods are on fire.

162
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,124
It's coming this way,
we've got to get out of here.

163
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:12,658
Out the back way.

164
00:11:13,065 --> 00:11:17,914
We will, as soon as I provide
that body we were talking about.

165
00:11:41,836 --> 00:11:45,237
My goodness. Lizzie, is that you?

166
00:11:45,381 --> 00:11:50,905
Yes Miss Cordelia, there's a storm
coming up and it's going to be a snorter.

167
00:11:51,134 --> 00:11:53,245
The wind nearly blew the door off its hinges.

168
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:57,132
Well, that noise blew my game higher than
a kite, I think I've lost some of the cards.

169
00:11:57,162 --> 00:11:58,600
Oh, I'll get them for you.

170
00:11:58,723 --> 00:12:00,506
Oh, I see you found the paper.

171
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,282
To rat that paper boy.

172
00:12:02,312 --> 00:12:07,573
Scooting by on his bicycle, just chucked it
into a couple bushes and let it go at that.

173
00:12:09,111 --> 00:12:14,312
For land's sake, Mr. Vick
Bailey is been arrested.

174
00:12:14,342 --> 00:12:16,031
- Oh?
- Right there.

175
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,599
Victor Bailey, vice president
and cashier of the Zenith bank,

176
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,187
was arraigned before United
States commissioner Alvin Fielding...

177
00:12:26,217 --> 00:12:29,187
charged with the
embezzlement of over a million dollars.

178
00:12:30,537 --> 00:12:33,903
I can't believe Vick Bailey had
anything to do with that robbery.

179
00:12:35,369 --> 00:12:38,957
Oh well, I see our landlord is home again.

180
00:12:38,987 --> 00:12:41,775
- Landlord?
- Mr. Fleming.

181
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:47,007
Dr. Malcolm Wells is back in
town with the body of John Fleming...

182
00:12:47,037 --> 00:12:50,580
president of the Zenith bank,
who was killed in a forest fire.

183
00:12:50,746 --> 00:12:54,953
Mr. Fleming will be laid to rest
in his family's tomb on Friday.

184
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,782
- And I hope he stays there.
- Why shouldn't he?

185
00:12:58,974 --> 00:13:04,662
Well, this is his house. And ever since he
died, some funny things have happened here.

186
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:05,944
For instance?

187
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:11,581
The housekeeper, the cook and the butler
said that they heard strange noises at night.

188
00:13:11,942 --> 00:13:17,927
And the upstairs maid swore that she met a
man without a face coming up the back stairs.

189
00:13:18,818 --> 00:13:24,169
Oh, so that's why they quit and
left me to run this place without a staff.

190
00:13:24,878 --> 00:13:29,114
They didn't tell you Miss Corny,
but the truth is, they were scared to stay.

191
00:13:29,144 --> 00:13:32,325
But you're still here Lizzie.
Haven't you seen anything?

192
00:13:32,702 --> 00:13:37,376
No, no, and even
if I had I ain't afraid of ghosts.

193
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,788
They're afraid of me.

194
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:45,456
Honest Miss Corny, a spiritualist told
me once that ghosts was allergic to me.

195
00:13:48,923 --> 00:13:54,003
But, but this Bat feller they keep
talking about in the paper, I...

196
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,690
I guess he'd be different.

197
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,539
No, I don't think you'd
have the same effect on him.

198
00:14:00,498 --> 00:14:01,945
Oh dear.

199
00:14:03,891 --> 00:14:08,217
What are they trying to do? Drive
people away from this part of the country?

200
00:14:09,393 --> 00:14:11,458
Why? What did it say about the Bat?

201
00:14:13,222 --> 00:14:19,177
His specialty seems to be killing women,
my goodness, two of them in one night.

202
00:14:20,398 --> 00:14:23,112
All his victims died the same way...

203
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:27,001
like their throats had been
ripped open with steel claws.

204
00:14:27,543 --> 00:14:33,166
Well, that's a charming little caper.
I'll have to try it sometime.

205
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,453
In a book.

206
00:14:42,196 --> 00:14:45,513
That ain't' nothing, just something
bumping against the house.

207
00:14:50,217 --> 00:14:53,684
That's just the wind
banging a door, pay no attention to it.

208
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,609
Listen to this, one of his
victims who lived for a moment...

209
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,596
after she was found, described
the Bat as a man without a face.

210
00:15:05,003 --> 00:15:08,561
Honest Miss Corny, I think
that woman must've been exaggerating.

211
00:15:14,124 --> 00:15:17,350
That's just that heavy
tapestry at the top of the stairs.

212
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,636
I know, I know, I've
heard it before on a windy night.

213
00:15:23,848 --> 00:15:26,893
But that sound a little
was someone on the stairs.

214
00:15:27,662 --> 00:15:29,893
I know there isn't, least there shouldn't be.

215
00:15:30,632 --> 00:15:35,516
There ain't, them is just the noises you
here in any old house on windy night.

216
00:15:36,662 --> 00:15:40,265
It says here that the Bat
never leaves no fingerprints.

217
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:45,331
That's understandable, having no
face, he probably has no fingers either.

218
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,240
Lizzie.

219
00:15:54,557 --> 00:15:58,160
And that, I suppose, is the
cat dropping its dentures?

220
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:04,341
No, no, I don't think so, but I think
it's something should be looked into.

221
00:16:11,249 --> 00:16:13,536
Now, who chucked him down here?

222
00:16:13,732 --> 00:16:15,752
The wind, I hope.

223
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,752
There must be a window open up there.

224
00:16:19,536 --> 00:16:24,028
No Lizzie, let him lay. Let him sleep it off.

225
00:16:24,722 --> 00:16:28,190
I hope the power lines don't
go down, put the lights out.

226
00:16:29,048 --> 00:16:31,234
We'll check the windows in the living room...

227
00:16:31,264 --> 00:16:33,571
and drawn the curtains
and then we'll go to bed.

228
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:34,807
Yes, ma'am.

229
00:16:44,285 --> 00:16:45,717
I won't be a minute.

230
00:16:52,602 --> 00:16:54,004
Miss Corny...

231
00:16:55,512 --> 00:16:56,476
What was that?

232
00:16:57,034 --> 00:17:01,966
Oh, when I went to get the
paper, I turned the latch off.

233
00:17:01,996 --> 00:17:04,436
I forgot to turn it on again.

234
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,297
He's out there, he was coming in.

235
00:17:08,855 --> 00:17:10,152
He might've got you.

236
00:17:10,182 --> 00:17:13,861
Oh, but he didn't and
he's still out there, thanks to you.

237
00:17:13,891 --> 00:17:16,062
Now, you hurry now go we'll call the police.

238
00:17:16,092 --> 00:17:18,912
No, no, I won't leave you Miss Corny.

239
00:17:18,942 --> 00:17:24,641
- Are you Ok?
- Yes ma'am, I'm, I'm ok.

240
00:17:24,898 --> 00:17:25,968
Ok.

241
00:17:34,802 --> 00:17:37,486
- Operator.
- Give me the police department please.

242
00:17:38,368 --> 00:17:41,880
- Zenith police department.
- This is Cornelia Van Gorder.

243
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,378
- I'm living at the Oaks.
- We know about that Miss Van Gorder.

244
00:17:45,408 --> 00:17:50,036
Just a moment ago, a man
tried to force his way into this house.

245
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:52,658
You're not alone there, are you?
What about your servants?

246
00:17:52,688 --> 00:17:57,468
Well, I have none except my chauffeur and
he's away, won't be back until the morning.

247
00:17:57,498 --> 00:18:01,748
Now, there's only two of us here tonight
and we're going to lock ourselves in my room.

248
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:07,251
Now, if, if any of your men see
anything, will you have them call me?

249
00:18:07,281 --> 00:18:10,778
- I'll send officers over there right away.
- Well, thank you very much.

250
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,864
Come on Lizzie, we're
going to sleep in my room.

251
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:30,426
Well, nothing can get at us in
this room now, I don't think.

252
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:34,979
- This door seems good and solid.
- Like the door to a tomb.

253
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:49,317
I think that couch will be comfortable,
it's some extra bedding you know...

254
00:18:49,347 --> 00:18:50,734
- in the closet.
- Yes, ma'am.

255
00:18:51,745 --> 00:18:52,966
Let's see now.

256
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:09,593
No bolt, no that's not so good.

257
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,121
- Ma'am, what's that for?
- That my good woman, is a boobie trap.

258
00:19:23,086 --> 00:19:28,000
If anybody tries to open this transom this'll
be knocked off, and we'll hear it fall..

259
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:06,986
Oh, fiddlesticks, I forgot my night things,
my robe, my gown and my sleepers.

260
00:20:07,212 --> 00:20:10,408
- I'll go get them now.
- Now, wait a minute, Lizzie.

261
00:20:10,694 --> 00:20:13,966
- I'll go with you...
- Now don't you bother Miss Cornelia.

262
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:17,042
- My room is just down the hall.
- Lizzie, I told you to wait!

263
00:20:17,946 --> 00:20:20,147
It's all right, I'll only be a second.

264
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:23,208
Get in here!

265
00:20:23,418 --> 00:20:25,210
Get in here!

266
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:37,139
- Yes?
- Miss Van Gorder?

267
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,460
- Yes?
- Zenith police department.

268
00:20:39,928 --> 00:20:41,872
There's a police car just outside your house.

269
00:20:41,902 --> 00:20:43,891
And the officers in
it have reported that there's...

270
00:20:43,921 --> 00:20:46,349
no sign of a prowler anywhere on the grounds.

271
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:50,751
Oh, the man is inside now, he's
in the hall just outside my bedroom.

272
00:20:51,204 --> 00:20:55,168
Have your men break through the kitchen door
and search this place from top to bottom.

273
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:58,530
- Ok, Miss Van Gorder, sit tight.
- I will.

274
00:20:58,756 --> 00:21:01,681
I have a gun and I know how to use it.

275
00:21:10,591 --> 00:21:17,435
Oh, relax, relax Lizzie, the police did a
good job, they couldn't find anybody in here.

276
00:21:17,465 --> 00:21:24,084
- But we both saw him Miss Cornelia.
- All right, all right, so he got away.

277
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:28,406
But there are men on guard
outside, so just try and get some rest.

278
00:21:29,115 --> 00:21:32,628
There's nothing can get at us here.

279
00:22:03,503 --> 00:22:07,851
- Oh, Miss Cordelia, Miss Cordelia!
- What?

280
00:22:07,881 --> 00:22:09,491
- What's the matter?
- A bat!

281
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,157
- Oh nonsense, you've had a nightmare.
- Maybe I did.

282
00:22:13,445 --> 00:22:16,233
But there was a bat and it bit me.

283
00:22:16,263 --> 00:22:18,874
- What?
- It flew in that closet.

284
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:21,962
Good gracious Lizzie, you're right!

285
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:41,271
Operator, operator, will you get me
Dr. Malcolm Wells' office please.

286
00:22:42,163 --> 00:22:45,117
No, I don't know his number and I have no
phone book up here, but this is an emergency.

287
00:22:45,147 --> 00:22:46,649
Will you connect me with his office please?

288
00:22:46,938 --> 00:22:49,646
Oh dear, oh dear, I'm
going to get the rabies.

289
00:22:49,676 --> 00:22:52,376
- Hello?
- Hello, Dr. Well's office?

290
00:22:52,406 --> 00:22:56,923
This is a call service, Dr. Wells is out at
moment, but if you give me your name and...

291
00:22:56,953 --> 00:23:00,781
- number, I'll try to locate him.
- Well, this is Miss Van Gorder of the Oaks.

292
00:23:00,986 --> 00:23:03,577
My maid has just been bitten
by a bat that may be rabid...

293
00:23:03,607 --> 00:23:05,376
and she must have
treatment as soon as possible.

294
00:23:05,406 --> 00:23:07,559
And I was told that Dr. Wells
was the nearest physician.

295
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:11,418
I'll try to find him for you and if I
can't, I'll send you another doctor.

296
00:23:11,448 --> 00:23:14,433
Well, thank you very much.
Oh, he's out on a case.

297
00:23:15,241 --> 00:23:19,751
Oh, I hope it's not a delivery, a baby I
mean, they can be terribly complicated.

298
00:23:19,781 --> 00:23:23,110
- It never bothered me none.
- Oh Lizzie, you never had a baby.

299
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,142
Of course I didn't, that's
why they never bothered me.

300
00:23:25,172 --> 00:23:27,313
- Oh, does it hurt, eh?
- A little.

301
00:24:48,733 --> 00:24:51,193
Dr. Wells? Are you there Dr. Wells?

302
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,466
Are you there
Dr. Wells? This is the operator.

303
00:24:58,776 --> 00:25:01,723
Your call service is
on the wire, it's an emergency.

304
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:09,257
- This is Dr. Wells.
- This is your call service doctor.

305
00:25:09,695 --> 00:25:13,881
Oh hello, I, I was just doing
an experiment, I left the receiver off.

306
00:25:14,098 --> 00:25:16,028
That's what I thought, but I kept trying.

307
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:19,826
Miss Van Gorder at the Oaks called and
said that her maid had been bitten by a bat.

308
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:22,510
- And she's afraid it might be rabid.
- What?

309
00:25:22,841 --> 00:25:29,156
Oh, all right, tell
her I'll be right over there.

310
00:26:59,998 --> 00:27:02,062
- Who's there?
- Dr. Wells.

311
00:27:03,828 --> 00:27:05,256
- Come in.
- Good evening.

312
00:27:06,337 --> 00:27:08,730
Oh, I'm so glad they found you doctor.

313
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:12,347
Well, I reached my office shortly
after you called, how is your maid?

314
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,697
- Is she in any pain?
- No, no, she doesn't seem to be.

315
00:27:16,007 --> 00:27:20,299
- Did the bat get away?
- No, I believe it's still in my bedroom.

316
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,094
Good, I'll want to examine it.

317
00:27:22,373 --> 00:27:24,748
There you go
Miss Allen, now you'll feel better?

318
00:27:25,414 --> 00:27:27,770
Doctor, have I got the rabies?

319
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,607
Well, I can tell you better after I've
examined the bat's brain under a microscope.

320
00:27:31,637 --> 00:27:35,022
- That thing got a brain?
- Oh, you'd be surprised.

321
00:27:35,746 --> 00:27:36,769
Where is it?

322
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:39,667
I think the little darling is in that closet.

323
00:27:42,148 --> 00:27:45,073
You know, it's a pity you
leased this house Miss Van Gorder.

324
00:27:45,103 --> 00:27:46,020
Why a pity?

325
00:27:46,736 --> 00:27:48,917
Well, my dear lady, I don't
want to alarm you but...

326
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:51,968
Oh, after tonight nothing can alarm me.

327
00:27:52,113 --> 00:27:54,671
Yes, I understand,
it must've been terrifying.

328
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,736
So many unexplainable
things had happened here.

329
00:27:59,325 --> 00:28:00,948
It's something about the place.

330
00:28:01,836 --> 00:28:05,457
Your servants must've sensed it
when they walked out on you...

331
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,238
an apprehension of disaster.

332
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,971
Well, let's see.

333
00:28:13,395 --> 00:28:15,394
Yes, there he is.

334
00:28:15,424 --> 00:28:21,343
All right now, take it easy, nobody is
going to hurt you, quiet now, quiet.

335
00:28:27,277 --> 00:28:30,009
Looks quite normal,
doesn't seem to be sick at all.

336
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:34,269
Ain't that nice. I've been worried about him.

337
00:28:34,761 --> 00:28:36,122
Well, you should be.

338
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:40,834
From his appearance, I'd say
that he doesn't have any infection.

339
00:28:41,973 --> 00:28:44,773
In which case, you had a narrow escape.

340
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:50,711
Now, you take one of those tablets I left
for you and I'll guarantee you a good night.

341
00:28:50,967 --> 00:28:52,622
And I'll drop in on here you tomorrow.

342
00:28:52,825 --> 00:28:55,162
Oh, thanks for everything doctor.

343
00:28:56,609 --> 00:29:00,433
- Now, don't worry, I can find my way out.
- I know you can, but do let me help you.

344
00:29:00,596 --> 00:29:04,671
Oh, don't forget that once I'm gone
you'll have to climb those stairs alone.

345
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,867
Oh, I'm all right, I'm armed now.

346
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:11,739
Can you shoot one of those
things without shutting your eyes?

347
00:29:11,769 --> 00:29:14,703
Oh doctor, there are guns
in every book I've ever written.

348
00:29:14,992 --> 00:29:17,136
I don't write about
things I'm unfamiliar with.

349
00:29:18,497 --> 00:29:19,566
Lock the door Lizzie.

350
00:29:19,596 --> 00:29:21,931
- Good night.
- Yes ma'am, good night doctor.

351
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,779
- Accident?
- No, no, the wind blew him down.

352
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:28,090
- Oh?
- I think.

353
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:33,521
Did you know that young Mark Fleming leased
you this house without notifying his uncle?

354
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,945
No, no, I didn't.

355
00:29:36,111 --> 00:29:40,046
Well, it doesn't matter now, John
Fleming is dead and Mark is his heir.

356
00:29:40,076 --> 00:29:43,242
But if John were alive, he would warn
you to leave here Miss Van Gorder.

357
00:29:43,272 --> 00:29:44,976
- Really?
- Yes.

358
00:29:45,353 --> 00:29:48,157
It's been a tragic place
for anyone who ever lived in it.

359
00:29:48,338 --> 00:29:50,674
- Well, good night.
- Good night doctor.

360
00:29:51,277 --> 00:29:52,453
Who is out there?

361
00:29:52,831 --> 00:29:55,665
- Nobody you need to worry about doctor.
- Oh, it's Andy.

362
00:29:55,695 --> 00:29:58,981
- That's right, good evening Miss Van Gorder.
- Good evening Lieutenant.

363
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:03,202
- Somebody sick here?
- My maid was bitten by a bat.

364
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:06,172
Oh? A rabid bat?

365
00:30:06,334 --> 00:30:10,333
Well, I'll know for sure when
I get to my lab, I, I caught the bat.

366
00:30:11,192 --> 00:30:12,700
It happened indoors?

367
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,886
- In my bedroom.
- How it get in?

368
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:17,238
Well there are ways a
bat could get in a house.

369
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:19,137
You ought to know.

370
00:30:19,937 --> 00:30:23,163
I, I spotted this hole in
the window the minute I got here.

371
00:30:24,475 --> 00:30:27,445
That's where the two
legged bat got your door open.

372
00:30:30,249 --> 00:30:34,169
Miss Van Gorder told me that she
phoned headquarters at Zenith.

373
00:30:34,516 --> 00:30:38,722
Yes, I phoned twice, the second time
was after the prowler got in the house.

374
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:42,068
- Were in headquarters, Andy?
- No, but they contacted me.

375
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:46,079
An officer came and searched the house from
top to bottom but they couldn't find the bat.

376
00:30:46,259 --> 00:30:49,682
- You better have this window fixed tomorrow.
- Oh yes, I certainly shall.

377
00:30:49,712 --> 00:30:53,300
And I, I better be going, I'm due
in surgery at 8 o'clock in the morning.

378
00:30:53,313 --> 00:30:54,652
- Good night.
- Good night doctor.

379
00:30:54,664 --> 00:30:56,706
There'll be a man patrolling the
grounds all night Miss Van Gorder.

380
00:30:56,707 --> 00:30:59,387
- Oh, thank you.
- And nobody inside Andy?

381
00:30:59,997 --> 00:31:01,032
Why should there be?

382
00:31:01,434 --> 00:31:05,452
Well, how do you know but what
the bat is hiding somewhere in the house?

383
00:31:06,002 --> 00:31:10,484
I'm quite sure he isn't in
the house doctor, not now.

384
00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:15,946
- Good night.
- Good night.

385
00:31:33,147 --> 00:31:36,195
- Hi Andy.
- Hello Mark.

386
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:42,350
Well, congratulations, real
estate business must be picking up.

387
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,791
- New office, new furniture.
- New deal, how do you like it?

388
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,707
Ah, looks expensive.

389
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:51,721
- Are you squandering your inheritance?
- Oh, I haven't got it yet.

390
00:31:51,886 --> 00:31:54,843
Oh, the paper says John Fleming
left his entire fortune to you.

391
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:58,298
Funny thing about that
entire fortune is that we can't find it.

392
00:31:58,328 --> 00:31:59,340
No kidding?

393
00:31:59,611 --> 00:32:03,021
No, all uncle John has in his bank
account was a couple hundred dollars.

394
00:32:03,413 --> 00:32:05,525
And his safe deposit box was empty.

395
00:32:06,037 --> 00:32:08,845
If we don't find that missing
million mine will be empty too.

396
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:10,007
How come?

397
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,341
Well, all my savings were
invested in Zenith bank stock.

398
00:32:14,156 --> 00:32:17,098
The examiners won't certify
the bank as solvent until those...

399
00:32:17,264 --> 00:32:19,558
stolen securities are found, so the...

400
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:22,877
stockholders have voted an
assessment that'll wipe some of us out.

401
00:32:23,631 --> 00:32:26,799
It's as is those securities
have been converted into cash.

402
00:32:27,177 --> 00:32:29,757
And if I can't find that cash, I'm sunk.

403
00:32:30,227 --> 00:32:31,854
Oh, where are you going to look for it Andy?

404
00:32:32,699 --> 00:32:33,876
Here in Zenith.

405
00:32:34,087 --> 00:32:36,592
Your uncle wouldn't take a
million on a hunting trip, would he?

406
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,863
You suspect uncle John?

407
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:46,671
Why Andy, he founded the Zenith back.
That'd be like robbing the family tomb.

408
00:32:47,698 --> 00:32:48,844
You think he wouldn't?

409
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,700
Well, besides...

410
00:32:51,182 --> 00:32:53,506
Vick Bailey's fingerprints
are all over the vault.

411
00:32:53,687 --> 00:32:55,965
Now, they didn't find any
of uncle John's fingerprints.

412
00:32:55,995 --> 00:32:59,587
- Because he wiped them off.
- Can the defense prove that?

413
00:33:00,086 --> 00:33:01,414
They'll try to.

414
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,597
Judie Holland had Bailey's
secretary as a defense witness.

415
00:33:05,051 --> 00:33:08,551
And they believe her testimony
will have a powerful effect on the jury.

416
00:33:09,683 --> 00:33:14,587
Well, she has a powerful
effect on me, Judie is a doll.

417
00:33:15,731 --> 00:33:18,328
- Here's the book you mentioned Judie.
- Your newest one?

418
00:33:18,358 --> 00:33:21,285
Yes, it's just been published.
You can have that copy if you wish.

419
00:33:21,315 --> 00:33:23,745
Oh, it's a first edition
and you've signed it.

420
00:33:23,775 --> 00:33:26,702
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you so much.

421
00:33:28,634 --> 00:33:31,938
- May I serve tea now Miss Van Gorder?
- Yes, please do Warner.

422
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:32,979
Thank you.

423
00:33:34,911 --> 00:33:38,260
- I see you've engaged new servants.
- Yes, of course.

424
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,644
Oh, how did you persuade
them to live in this house?

425
00:33:41,112 --> 00:33:44,839
Jane Patterson, my new housekeeper,
knows this house better than you do doctor.

426
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:49,486
She worked for John Fleming
and Warner was my chauffeur.

427
00:33:50,949 --> 00:33:53,680
- Chauffeur turned butler?
- It's incredible.

428
00:33:53,967 --> 00:33:56,200
He can play any part at a moment's notice.

429
00:33:56,562 --> 00:33:59,007
Ah, did you, did you get a plumber Warner?

430
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,693
No, we can't get a
plumber for three days madame.

431
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,993
What about that leaking pipe? The
basement will be flooded in three days.

432
00:34:06,023 --> 00:34:07,985
The pipe is no longer leaking.

433
00:34:08,603 --> 00:34:11,123
You mean it's dried up of its own accord?

434
00:34:11,153 --> 00:34:14,306
No, not quite, I packed the elbow
where the water was coming up.

435
00:34:14,775 --> 00:34:16,495
Packed the elbow?

436
00:34:17,008 --> 00:34:21,534
- Where did you learn how to do that?
- Into each life, a little rain must fall.

437
00:34:21,564 --> 00:34:23,902
And a careful man learns to keep himself dry.

438
00:34:24,174 --> 00:34:26,634
Now, is there anything that
you require Miss Van Gorder?

439
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:29,651
- No, not at the moment Warner.
- Thank you madame.

440
00:34:31,476 --> 00:34:33,679
Now, there's a character.

441
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,194
How long did you say that he
worked for you as chauffeur?

442
00:34:37,587 --> 00:34:38,658
About three months.

443
00:34:38,688 --> 00:34:41,027
Well, I hope he doesn't have a police record.

444
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:44,015
My dear Dale...

445
00:34:44,045 --> 00:34:47,396
it may interest you to know that
the last night of his life, John Fleming...

446
00:34:47,426 --> 00:34:50,243
told me that he loved
your husband like a son.

447
00:34:51,073 --> 00:34:55,615
If Fleming were alive today, he would
be fighting to prove Vick's innocence.

448
00:34:56,988 --> 00:34:59,342
Could Mr. Fleming prove his own innocence?

449
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,430
Miss Van Gorder,
can there be any doubt about it?

450
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:07,896
There will be when
Miss Holland testifies at Vick's trial.

451
00:35:08,877 --> 00:35:09,873
Oh?

452
00:35:10,582 --> 00:35:13,298
You know something
that we haven't heard yet Judie?

453
00:35:13,871 --> 00:35:16,964
Something I saw with my own eyes.

454
00:35:17,809 --> 00:35:20,072
She's not permitted to say what it was.

455
00:35:20,299 --> 00:35:22,592
My dear girl, I wouldn't think of asking her.

456
00:35:23,362 --> 00:35:26,749
But let's assume for a moment
that Fleming did steal the million, now...

457
00:35:26,779 --> 00:35:28,718
what would he do about it? Where is it?

458
00:35:29,488 --> 00:35:32,928
Hidden some place where he could lay his hands
on it without getting caught in the act.

459
00:35:34,392 --> 00:35:38,270
Now, if I was writing this
instead of living in the middle of it...

460
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,740
I'd hide it right
here in this spooky old house.

461
00:35:42,102 --> 00:35:45,255
Under a loose floorboard or up a chimney?

462
00:35:46,704 --> 00:35:48,635
If Mr. Fleming...

463
00:35:48,861 --> 00:35:53,086
had the nerve to steal a million,
he'd make his plans well in advance.

464
00:35:54,157 --> 00:35:56,525
I'd say he'd prepare a place to hide it.

465
00:35:57,641 --> 00:36:00,387
Possibly when this house was being built.

466
00:36:01,565 --> 00:36:04,718
I rented this place from
Mark Fleming, his nephew.

467
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,139
I wonder, I wonder if he had the floor plans.

468
00:36:09,637 --> 00:36:12,263
- I'll ask him.
- Yes.

469
00:36:12,293 --> 00:36:15,491
Lizzie, will you bring Miss Bailey the phone?

470
00:36:15,763 --> 00:36:19,836
You ask him now, his number is Summit...

471
00:36:19,866 --> 00:36:23,986
- Summit 7537.
- Thank you Lizzie.

472
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:26,687
- Summit...?
- 7537.

473
00:36:30,323 --> 00:36:33,100
Not bad, eh Andy? That means new business.

474
00:36:35,097 --> 00:36:37,822
Now, you see? Somebody wants to buy a house.

475
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,197
- Mark Fleming speaking.
- Oh hello Dale.

476
00:36:45,004 --> 00:36:47,282
Well, hang on a minute
honey while I see if I have them.

477
00:36:48,067 --> 00:36:49,726
It's Dale Bailey all excited.

478
00:36:49,756 --> 00:36:53,453
Miss Van Gorder wants to know
if I have the floor plans of the Oaks.

479
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,852
Now, what would she want
with the floor plans?

480
00:36:56,712 --> 00:37:00,665
Well, she suggested to me that your
uncle might've hidden the bank loot there.

481
00:37:01,269 --> 00:37:02,540
Are the plans here?

482
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,777
Somewhere in the house itself.

483
00:37:08,904 --> 00:37:11,801
Wait a minute, there is a place where
uncle Johnny might've kept those blueprints.

484
00:37:12,963 --> 00:37:13,676
What place?

485
00:37:13,706 --> 00:37:16,041
Well, I heard him talk
about it a good many years ago.

486
00:37:16,071 --> 00:37:18,491
I can't be sure of the exact location.

487
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:22,501
Anyway, I don't think the old boy
had the guts to steal a million.

488
00:37:22,983 --> 00:37:25,892
But if I find those plans,
I'll let you know Andy.

489
00:37:26,962 --> 00:37:28,048
Hello Dale?

490
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:31,123
Look honey, I haven't seen
those plans since I was a kid.

491
00:37:31,153 --> 00:37:33,249
But I'll come over tonight,
and maybe we can find them.

492
00:37:34,214 --> 00:37:36,189
Thank you Mark, we'll expect you.

493
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,922
He seems to think they're
here in the house somewhere.

494
00:37:40,952 --> 00:37:43,470
- He's coming over tonight.
- Oh, that's good.

495
00:37:43,893 --> 00:37:46,350
Dale and Judie are my
house guests for the weekend.

496
00:37:46,576 --> 00:37:48,682
Would you like to have
dinner with us tonight?

497
00:37:48,712 --> 00:37:51,928
Oh no thank you, I couldn't,
I still have a few calls to make.

498
00:37:52,546 --> 00:37:56,407
You know, if Judy's testimony is
going to clear Vick Bailey and implicate...

499
00:37:56,437 --> 00:38:00,718
John Fleming, others may get the idea
that there's buried treasure in this house.

500
00:38:01,065 --> 00:38:04,758
Don't even mention your testimony
until you're actually on the stand.

501
00:38:04,788 --> 00:38:05,768
Oh, I won't.

502
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,856
That's a smart girl
Judie and a very lovely girl.

503
00:38:09,066 --> 00:38:10,397
- Well, good afternoon ladies.
- Doctor.

504
00:38:10,427 --> 00:38:11,919
- Doctor.
- Goodbye Dr. Wells.

505
00:38:11,949 --> 00:38:13,653
Come on girls, let's go.

506
00:38:57,641 --> 00:39:01,756
So many unusual things
have happened here this summer.

507
00:39:02,088 --> 00:39:04,108
The more I think about it...

508
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,737
the more I realize I should've
be putting them down on paper.

509
00:39:09,822 --> 00:39:12,822
Weren't you your husband's secretary Dale?

510
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:15,174
- Yes, I was.
- You take shorthand?

511
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:19,772
Well my dear, if you'd like
to have your mind occupied...

512
00:39:20,661 --> 00:39:25,499
I want you to work with me while I write
the story of this fantastic criminal...

513
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,911
the Bat.

514
00:40:16,137 --> 00:40:18,353
- Wonderful dinner.
- Thank you.

515
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,336
Was really nice.

516
00:40:21,693 --> 00:40:22,823
Was a good dinner Lizzie.

517
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:24,225
- As usual.
- Wonderful.

518
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:28,944
Oh, what a lovely piece of silver.

519
00:40:29,155 --> 00:40:34,160
- It's an original, isn't it?
- Yes, they still use them in England.

520
00:40:57,525 --> 00:41:00,058
That clock hasn't struck the
hour in the last 10 years...

521
00:41:00,088 --> 00:41:02,349
if I'm to believe what Mark Fleming told me.

522
00:41:02,515 --> 00:41:04,369
Why is it angled away
from the wall like that?

523
00:41:04,399 --> 00:41:06,826
I don't know. Somebody must've moved it.

524
00:41:07,278 --> 00:41:10,565
- Lizzie, very like when she was dusting.
- Wait a minute.

525
00:41:11,152 --> 00:41:13,081
Did you know there's a door in this paneling?

526
00:41:13,111 --> 00:41:17,371
No, I didn't. Oh, by gracious, so there is.

527
00:41:17,401 --> 00:41:21,138
- Maybe it opens to a secret passage.
- Certainly to a secret something!

528
00:41:21,741 --> 00:41:25,253
Who knows girls, we may be about
to stumble on that missing million.

529
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:30,610
Oh, there's a panel, there must
be some gimmick to it, there always is.

530
00:41:44,845 --> 00:41:48,242
Calling car 11, calling car 11.

531
00:41:49,261 --> 00:41:54,849
Proceed to the Oaks in Zenith township
immediately, a homicide is been reported.

532
00:41:56,274 --> 00:41:59,670
Ok, proceeding to the Oaks.

533
00:42:00,157 --> 00:42:04,487
Notify the county coroner, Dr. Wells.
Tell him to come to the Oaks at once.

534
00:42:14,646 --> 00:42:15,379
Horrible.

535
00:42:16,219 --> 00:42:20,850
It's as if his throat had been torn
by some creature with fans or claws.

536
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,517
That's his sign.

537
00:42:23,312 --> 00:42:24,972
We found it on the others he killed.

538
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:30,683
I'd hoped those reports that he was up to his
old tricks again were pure imagination but...

539
00:42:31,578 --> 00:42:33,322
apparently they're based on fact.

540
00:42:34,642 --> 00:42:35,591
He's come back...

541
00:42:36,756 --> 00:42:38,670
back to the scene of his kills.

542
00:42:40,738 --> 00:42:41,981
Yes, that's who I mean.

543
00:42:42,985 --> 00:42:44,119
That's who did this.

544
00:42:45,524 --> 00:42:46,388
The Bat.

545
00:42:47,894 --> 00:42:50,171
- Who found Mark?
- We all did.

546
00:42:51,043 --> 00:42:54,756
That is Dale and Judie and I,
Lizzie was in the dining room.

547
00:42:55,104 --> 00:42:59,195
This is my new housekeeper, Jane Patterson.
You know, she worked for John Fleming.

548
00:42:59,342 --> 00:43:00,044
I know her.

549
00:43:00,747 --> 00:43:02,113
Where were you Miss Patterson?

550
00:43:02,452 --> 00:43:04,351
In the kitchen, cleaning up.

551
00:43:05,176 --> 00:43:06,843
I cooked the dinner tonight.

552
00:43:07,365 --> 00:43:09,898
Did you know that this
secret closet was here?

553
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:15,808
- No, it was behind the grandfather's clock.
- Well, it was I who found it, really.

554
00:43:15,991 --> 00:43:19,881
Noticed the clock had been moved
and the door wasn't quite closed.

555
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:21,343
I'll get it.

556
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:36,373
Who is it?

557
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:46,473
Mark Fleming.

558
00:43:47,271 --> 00:43:50,030
As coroner, you saw the
same wounds on the others.

559
00:43:51,146 --> 00:43:54,070
- How long is he been dead?
- Oh, I'd say about a half an hour.

560
00:43:54,661 --> 00:43:58,262
- You believe it was the Bat?
- That's the Bat's trademark.

561
00:43:59,121 --> 00:44:03,236
- Perhaps he's still in the house.
- It's possible.

562
00:44:06,975 --> 00:44:08,106
Why should he be?

563
00:44:08,621 --> 00:44:11,965
Because he's looking for something
and like you, he believes it's here.

564
00:44:12,596 --> 00:44:14,558
And he's a persistent killer.

565
00:44:14,588 --> 00:44:17,648
I would advise you
get out of this house as quickly as possible.

566
00:44:17,859 --> 00:44:20,784
Not withstanding
our expert police protection.

567
00:44:21,703 --> 00:44:23,754
- Have you called the morgue?
- They're on their way here.

568
00:44:23,784 --> 00:44:26,437
Oh, good, I want to examine
the body before they get here.

569
00:44:26,693 --> 00:44:30,477
- Oh, may we take it into another room?
- Yes, to the sun room in the back.

570
00:44:30,507 --> 00:44:32,754
- Thank you, give me a hand.
- Excuse me.

571
00:44:42,689 --> 00:44:44,709
Oh, Warner, where have you been?

572
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:48,478
Well madame, it would have been an accident?

573
00:44:48,674 --> 00:44:50,649
There's been a murder.

574
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:56,060
Mark Fleming, the young man from whom I
leased this place is killed here tonight.,

575
00:44:56,973 --> 00:45:00,342
- They know who did it?
- Well they, they believe it was the Bat.

576
00:45:00,372 --> 00:45:03,229
I'm sorry I had to use the
front door Miss Van Gorder.

577
00:45:03,259 --> 00:45:07,231
Bu I forgot my keys and when I rang the bell
at the kitchen door, there was no response.

578
00:45:07,488 --> 00:45:11,664
Oh, this is Warner Lieutenant.
He's my butler, he was my chauffeur.

579
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:13,624
Why did you promote him?

580
00:45:13,654 --> 00:45:17,348
Well, it's very difficult to find a butler
they don't like service in the country.

581
00:45:18,388 --> 00:45:19,940
Have you been a butler before?

582
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:24,490
I've served in many capacities sir, but
this was my night off and I forgot my keys.

583
00:45:24,491 --> 00:45:25,384
I heard that part.

584
00:45:26,379 --> 00:45:27,711
What time you leave the house tonight?

585
00:45:27,989 --> 00:45:30,912
Oh, about 6:30, I had
dinner at Wiley's roadhouse.

586
00:45:31,716 --> 00:45:33,701
Can you prove where you
spent the rest of the evening?

587
00:45:34,451 --> 00:45:36,544
- I can try.
- Try hard.

588
00:45:37,517 --> 00:45:39,409
And don't leave the
house, I'll get to you later.

589
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,854
Very good sir.

590
00:45:41,195 --> 00:45:43,945
I shall be in my room Miss
Van Gorder, if you need me.

591
00:45:44,849 --> 00:45:45,729
Yes Warner.

592
00:45:48,418 --> 00:45:50,164
Surely, you don't think he's...

593
00:45:51,261 --> 00:45:52,883
Warner and I met before.

594
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:56,515
I can't recall where or when.

595
00:45:57,889 --> 00:45:58,824
But I will.

596
00:46:04,416 --> 00:46:06,255
There'll be a crew
here shortly from headquarters...

597
00:46:06,285 --> 00:46:08,155
dusting for fingerprints, taking photographs.

598
00:46:08,958 --> 00:46:10,210
But in the meantime...

599
00:46:11,082 --> 00:46:13,577
Miss Patterson, you aren't
leaving the house tonight are you?

600
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:14,968
No Lieutenant.

601
00:46:15,477 --> 00:46:16,852
Don't, I'll talk to you in the morning.

602
00:46:17,193 --> 00:46:17,633
Good night.

603
00:46:18,073 --> 00:46:20,375
- Good night sir.
- Good night Miss Patterson.

604
00:46:21,418 --> 00:46:22,384
Dale...

605
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,051
I was with Mark Fleming
this afternoon when you...

606
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:26,874
talked to him about
the floor plans of this house.

607
00:46:27,394 --> 00:46:29,132
I heard him tell you he
was coming here tonight.

608
00:46:29,422 --> 00:46:31,776
Dale called him at my request.

609
00:46:32,548 --> 00:46:34,262
She told me he was coming.

610
00:46:35,095 --> 00:46:36,351
Who else heard her tell you that?

611
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,855
- Judie, Lizzie...
- And that nice Dr. Wells..

612
00:46:42,072 --> 00:46:43,231
Dr. Wells?

613
00:46:46,961 --> 00:46:49,061
There are few killers
who kill for the fun of it.

614
00:46:49,942 --> 00:46:53,372
The Bat very likely is a mental case and I'm
convinced that his crimes are motivated...

615
00:46:53,402 --> 00:46:55,778
by his, mainly personal gain.

616
00:46:56,293 --> 00:46:57,922
There's a million dollars at large.

617
00:46:58,187 --> 00:47:01,217
And he's going to keep on hunting
for it until he lays his hands on it.

618
00:47:02,002 --> 00:47:03,921
Now, these young ladies
are staying here tonight?

619
00:47:03,951 --> 00:47:05,285
Yes, they're my house guests.

620
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,858
Well, when my crew
arrives we'll be busy for a while...

621
00:47:08,864 --> 00:47:10,790
- so I'd suggest that...
- That we go to our rooms?

622
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,412
- That's very good idea.
- Come on girls.

623
00:47:16,973 --> 00:47:20,081
What about a police guard for
this house tonight Lieutenant?

624
00:47:20,111 --> 00:47:21,318
You've got one.

625
00:47:21,937 --> 00:47:24,411
I'm going to cover this place tonight
from the attic to the basement.

626
00:47:24,638 --> 00:47:27,761
If the Bat makes another call,
I'll have a little surprise for him.

627
00:47:29,707 --> 00:47:34,943
Who, who is he? Have you any idea?

628
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:41,476
He could be anybody.

629
00:47:41,506 --> 00:47:45,595
So far, there are clues to his identity
but nothing we could take before a jury.

630
00:47:47,074 --> 00:47:49,910
I am afraid we must look
higher than the criminal world.

631
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,924
He may be a
merchant, lawyer, doctor, scientist.

632
00:47:54,573 --> 00:47:56,278
One of the pillars of his community.

633
00:47:58,014 --> 00:48:01,107
Ladies, lock your
doors tonight, stay behind them.

634
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:05,391
- I promise you you'll be safe, good night.
- Good night Lieutenant.

635
00:48:39,233 --> 00:48:41,904
- Poor Mark.
- Yeah, it's a pity.

636
00:48:42,236 --> 00:48:46,943
- So young.
- Well doctor, do you agree it was the Bat?

637
00:48:47,683 --> 00:48:49,436
In my report, I shall say the death was...

638
00:48:49,466 --> 00:48:52,210
caused by the same
technique used in the other killings.

639
00:48:52,828 --> 00:48:57,875
A paralyzing blow to the throat, followed
by severe lacerations of the jugular...

640
00:48:58,496 --> 00:49:00,684
resulting in excessive hemorrhage.

641
00:49:01,363 --> 00:49:03,886
In a layman's language,
he didn't know what hit him.

642
00:49:04,249 --> 00:49:09,020
Oh, he knew, but he didn't
have time to think about it.

643
00:49:17,714 --> 00:49:19,207
You staying here tonight Andy?

644
00:49:19,388 --> 00:49:24,348
Well, until I check the doors and windows but
I'll be back bright and early in the morning.

645
00:49:25,117 --> 00:49:28,177
Neither snow nor rain
nor heat nor gloom of night...

646
00:49:28,207 --> 00:49:31,886
stays these couriers from the swift
completion of their appointed rounds.

647
00:49:32,398 --> 00:49:35,217
A lot of people are due for a
shock when I close this case.

648
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:40,464
Yes, I'm sure they are.
Good night Andy, don't get hurt.

649
00:49:42,217 --> 00:49:43,133
Good night, doctor.

650
00:49:57,604 --> 00:49:59,657
You know, I think we'd
better let get some sleep.

651
00:49:59,658 --> 00:50:02,699
Oh well Lizzie and I share
this room for mutual protection.

652
00:50:02,956 --> 00:50:06,324
You know, one night, a storm blew
the wires down, put the lights out...

653
00:50:06,325 --> 00:50:08,946
and when I went out the next day and
bought a half a dozen of these things.

654
00:50:08,976 --> 00:50:11,401
- You better take one with you Dale.
- Oh, thank you.

655
00:50:13,361 --> 00:50:16,982
- We'll go across the hall.
- Are you sure there's nothing else you need?

656
00:50:17,012 --> 00:50:18,749
- No.
- Quite sure, we'll be all right.

657
00:50:18,779 --> 00:50:21,211
Well, if anything
bothers you, you just sing out.

658
00:50:21,346 --> 00:50:23,673
And two strong
women will come to your rescue.

659
00:50:24,474 --> 00:50:27,033
Oh, nothing will bother us,
not with Andy on the job.

660
00:50:27,545 --> 00:50:29,090
- Good night.
- Good night.

661
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:30,963
Don't worry, everything will be all right.

662
00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:32,479
- Good night.
- Good night.

663
00:50:33,849 --> 00:50:34,643
Come on Lizzie.

664
00:50:57,372 --> 00:51:01,389
- No, I don't think I'll sleep tonight.
- Me neither.

665
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:06,580
All I can see is poor
Mark Fleming staring at us.

666
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:11,932
I thought that when people died
their eyes closed, as in sleep.

667
00:51:12,733 --> 00:51:16,482
- Don't think about it.
- I bet you're thinking about it.

668
00:51:17,637 --> 00:51:21,291
No, I was thinking of my poor
husband sleeping in jail tonight.

669
00:51:22,281 --> 00:51:26,656
Oh Judie, I love him so much.

670
00:54:48,041 --> 00:54:50,868
- What's that noise?
- Oh, I don't know.

671
00:54:51,401 --> 00:54:52,706
I kind of fell half asleep.

672
00:54:53,077 --> 00:54:54,946
For a moment, I thought it
was something from a dream.

673
00:54:55,116 --> 00:54:56,542
It's somewhere in the house.

674
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:00,160
Yes, on the floor
above, not directly over us.

675
00:55:00,554 --> 00:55:02,693
Probably a room overlooking the driveway.

676
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:32,653
- Should we call Miss Van Gorder?
- She'll hear it.

677
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,282
How can she help but hear it?

678
00:55:35,418 --> 00:55:38,331
Besides, we don't want her to think
we're a couple of hysterical women.

679
00:55:38,361 --> 00:55:41,374
I'm about to become
one, I've had it for one night.

680
00:55:41,559 --> 00:55:45,134
- Dale, you're not going out in that hall.
- I want to know what's happening up there.

681
00:55:45,313 --> 00:55:48,797
But Lieutenant Anderson said if we stayed
behind our locked doors, we'd be safe.

682
00:55:49,044 --> 00:55:53,231
Vick isn't safe locked up in that jail.
Suppose that stolen money is in this house.

683
00:55:53,331 --> 00:55:54,976
Mark Fleming seemed to think it was.

684
00:55:55,424 --> 00:55:57,579
Maybe that's what somebody is looking for.

685
00:56:01,642 --> 00:56:05,921
Oh, for heaven's sake, don't you
hear that awful noise up there?

686
00:56:06,995 --> 00:56:09,645
Now Lizzie, you just got to stay awake!

687
00:56:10,208 --> 00:56:15,422
The house phone and the outside phone
wires have been cut and we can't get help!

688
00:56:15,452 --> 00:56:17,931
- Where's that policeman?
- Oh, I don't know.

689
00:56:17,961 --> 00:56:21,281
Something must've happened to him.
Now go on, get on your robe.

690
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:24,130
- Oh Dale please, don't go up there.
- I've got to.

691
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,080
Think what it could
mean to Vick, now you stay here.

692
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:28,313
Oh no, if you go, I go.

693
00:56:49,435 --> 00:56:50,968
- You stay here.
- No, no.

694
00:56:50,998 --> 00:56:53,648
- You won't go there alone.
- You wait here, I'm going to see what it is.

695
00:56:53,663 --> 00:56:57,258
- Oh please let me go with you.
- Judie, will you warn me if anyone comes?

696
00:56:57,288 --> 00:57:00,241
I'll only be a moment, now, wait.

697
00:58:04,984 --> 00:58:06,096
Oh no.

698
00:58:09,163 --> 00:58:10,682
What he do to her!

699
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:16,517
- Judie!
- No, not Judie!

700
00:58:18,711 --> 00:58:21,059
Give her to me, I'll look after her.

701
00:58:30,014 --> 00:58:31,613
Poor baby.

702
00:58:43,981 --> 00:58:44,846
Judie.

703
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,957
- The Bat.
- Yes, the Bat.

704
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:57,513
He caught her at the head of the stairs.

705
00:58:57,707 --> 00:59:00,643
We saw him rushing down the
stairs as we came out of the room.

706
00:59:01,153 --> 00:59:02,868
I hurled that after him.

707
00:59:03,725 --> 00:59:05,834
I hit him, I believe.

708
00:59:06,197 --> 00:59:09,302
I'm going to cover this place
from attic to basement, you said!

709
00:59:09,403 --> 00:59:12,732
Well, what were you covering when that
poor child was murdered? Where were you?

710
00:59:13,597 --> 00:59:15,513
I saw a man outside on the grounds.

711
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:17,498
I went out there and hunted him.

712
00:59:18,084 --> 00:59:20,179
I heard him in among the trees and so I...

713
00:59:20,209 --> 00:59:23,005
followed the sound of him as far as
the brook down near the back road.

714
00:59:23,669 --> 00:59:24,890
And then I lost him.

715
00:59:25,455 --> 00:59:28,436
I'd rather give my own life
than have this happen to Judy.

716
00:59:29,572 --> 00:59:32,870
But I told you to stay in your rooms
and lock your doors and stay there!

717
00:59:33,604 --> 00:59:35,535
What was she doing at
the head of those stairs?

718
00:59:36,701 --> 00:59:38,045
That was my fault.

719
00:59:38,246 --> 00:59:41,583
They heard a strange noise, heavy pounding
in one of the rooms on the third floor.

720
00:59:41,613 --> 00:59:43,753
- We all heard it.
- I wanted to see what it was.

721
00:59:43,783 --> 00:59:46,526
Judie, she wouldn't let me go out by myself.

722
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:49,137
I made her stay on the balcony.

723
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:52,900
- What about your new butler?
- Well, he's in his room I suppose.

724
00:59:53,579 --> 00:59:55,618
- Oh, Miss Patterson.
- Yes?

725
00:59:55,648 --> 00:59:57,017
Did you know what happened here?

726
00:59:57,489 --> 01:00:01,236
No sir, but I heard the
screams, I went to call Warner.

727
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,414
We have rooms on the same floor.

728
01:00:03,747 --> 01:00:07,293
He wasn't in his room,
his bed hasn't been slept in.

729
01:00:07,903 --> 01:00:10,505
If Miss Patterson heard the screams,
Warner could certainly hear them.

730
01:00:11,137 --> 01:00:13,944
- You're quite right sir, I heard them.
- Oh, you did?

731
01:00:14,422 --> 01:00:17,087
- And where were you?
- Outside on the grounds.

732
01:00:17,636 --> 01:00:20,401
- Miss Holland is been murdered.
- No?

733
01:00:21,174 --> 01:00:23,600
So you're surprised, shocked.

734
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:26,899
Well, I've seen better performances.

735
01:00:27,872 --> 01:00:31,472
I remember you now, your name is not Warner.

736
01:00:32,214 --> 01:00:34,354
I've got a circular in my
office with your picture on it.

737
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:38,363
The Chicago police not so long ago were
hunting for you in connection with a robbery.

738
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:42,079
You're right again sir, and they found me
and they tried me and I proved my innocence.

739
01:00:42,109 --> 01:00:44,991
- And I was acquitted.
- That could've been a lucky break.

740
01:00:46,112 --> 01:00:49,542
- Where were you when this child was killed?
- I told you before sir, outside.

741
01:00:50,029 --> 01:00:52,308
- What you doing there?
- I was following you.

742
01:00:52,532 --> 01:00:54,641
I saw you leaving the house
and seemed that you were hunting...

743
01:00:54,671 --> 01:00:56,387
someone, I thought you might need some help.

744
01:00:56,542 --> 01:00:59,400
Oh yes sir, I followed your
flashlight down through the trees.

745
01:00:59,702 --> 01:01:03,858
Then it disappeared and then suddenly
as I was staring out into the darkness...

746
01:01:03,888 --> 01:01:06,214
I was struck by something
on to the back of the head.

747
01:01:06,469 --> 01:01:10,803
Next thing I knew, I was lying on the
ground, I realized I'd been knocked out.

748
01:01:11,429 --> 01:01:13,013
I wish you had been knocked out.

749
01:01:13,445 --> 01:01:15,762
For then we'd found you
with your mask still on your face!

750
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:17,740
You were hit here in this house...

751
01:01:18,073 --> 01:01:20,514
with this poker as you were rushing
down those stairs after that child...

752
01:01:20,544 --> 01:01:23,519
Oh no sir, you can't
pin this on me, I'm not the Bat!

753
01:01:23,766 --> 01:01:27,551
I've never killed, I couldn't kill,
I won't take the rap for this!

754
01:01:58,428 --> 01:01:59,355
Well doctor...

755
01:02:00,352 --> 01:02:02,414
we have another case for the county coroner.

756
01:02:04,091 --> 01:02:05,683
You see, the Bat came back.

757
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,645
Why did you come back doctor?

758
01:02:12,094 --> 01:02:16,018
Well I, I had an accident
about a mile down the road.

759
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:20,158
The right rear wheel of my car
came off and I plunged into the ditch.

760
01:02:20,621 --> 01:02:24,121
This was the nearest house
so I came here to call for help.

761
01:02:25,696 --> 01:02:27,906
I thought I'd find you around Andy.

762
01:02:32,146 --> 01:02:33,668
Physician, heal thyself.

763
01:02:36,217 --> 01:02:39,091
You're must've been hit by
something on the back of your head.

764
01:02:39,593 --> 01:02:42,274
- I told you I had an accident.
- So you did doctor.

765
01:02:43,131 --> 01:02:44,097
So you did.

766
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,511
I could be wrong.

767
01:02:48,663 --> 01:02:49,798
But maybe I'm not.

768
01:02:51,421 --> 01:02:52,271
We shall see.

769
01:02:55,739 --> 01:02:57,956
Fine dear, let's start a new chapter.

770
01:02:58,682 --> 01:03:01,146
For days, the murders held the headlines.

771
01:03:02,235 --> 01:03:03,725
Lieutenant Anderson grilled us...

772
01:03:05,193 --> 01:03:08,252
and ransacked the house from top to bottom.

773
01:03:08,592 --> 01:03:13,436
Warner was not placed under arrest
but his every move was watched.

774
01:03:14,372 --> 01:03:15,353
At night...

775
01:03:15,707 --> 01:03:21,074
except for a detective on guard in the house,
the police and the reporters left us alone.

776
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,526
And on one of those nights...

777
01:03:24,054 --> 01:03:30,844
without telling Lizzie or anyone else,
I pursued a secret investigation of my own.

778
01:03:38,803 --> 01:03:43,687
It was in an empty room on the third floor
where we kept our trunks and other things.

779
01:05:46,406 --> 01:05:47,594
Put them up Bat.

780
01:05:52,121 --> 01:05:56,552
A bright idea to kill me in my own lab
and let people think that I'm the Bat.

781
01:05:57,156 --> 01:06:00,739
But you had to kill me first.
What would it to be? Ambush?

782
01:06:01,758 --> 01:06:04,814
As clever as you are, you're
not smart enough to do that.

783
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:08,604
Nor were you smart enough to find the
money, though you came quite close to it.

784
01:06:09,057 --> 01:06:10,829
But I know where it is.

785
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:14,884
And when you're dead with that
sign pinned on your chest...

786
01:06:15,073 --> 01:06:18,185
I'm going to collect it
and live happily ever after.

787
01:06:19,637 --> 01:06:23,446
He destroyed himself, how true that will be.

788
01:06:23,994 --> 01:06:29,482
Well, goodbye Bat, here's a serum that
will heal you whether you're rabid or not.

789
01:08:17,753 --> 01:08:23,165
Something is wrong, something is wrong.

790
01:08:32,218 --> 01:08:33,651
Miss Cornelia?

791
01:08:42,666 --> 01:08:44,062
Miss Cornelia?

792
01:08:51,081 --> 01:08:55,076
Now, wonder would she be
going at this time of night.

793
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:19,400
I never!

794
01:09:24,415 --> 01:09:26,993
Mr. Davenport, Mr. Davenport...

795
01:09:27,249 --> 01:09:33,324
Oh, a fine thing, the door unbolted, the
chain off and you asleep on the job.

796
01:09:33,354 --> 01:09:35,963
Wait till Lieutenant
Anderson hears about this.

797
01:09:36,415 --> 01:09:37,590
Come on, wake up.

798
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:40,410
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't know, I don't know.

799
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:45,067
- My head hurts, my whole body is numb.
- Here, here, take a sip of this.

800
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:47,389
Try to snap out
of it, I'll be back in a minute.

801
01:10:01,108 --> 01:10:03,113
Hurry, will you? It's Lizzie.

802
01:10:04,485 --> 01:10:08,088
I'm terribly worried, I can't
find Miss Cornelia anywhere...

803
01:10:08,118 --> 01:10:10,621
and something's happened to the
policeman, I don't know what.

804
01:10:10,651 --> 01:10:13,736
Get Warner, bring him to the
drawing room, tell him we need him.

805
01:10:18,922 --> 01:10:21,545
- Are you all right now?
- Yeah, I'll be all right in a minute.

806
01:10:22,103 --> 01:10:25,464
I remember now, I took a drink
of wine from that decanter there.

807
01:10:25,646 --> 01:10:28,992
- Miss Van Gorder told me to help myself.
- She wouldn't put nothing in it.

808
01:10:29,263 --> 01:10:32,444
Well, somebody did, somebody
who knew I was on duty here.

809
01:10:32,685 --> 01:10:34,931
Mean it was somebody
that got Miss Van Gorder.

810
01:10:34,961 --> 01:10:38,429
I can't find her anywhere, upstairs,
downstairs or in the basement.

811
01:10:38,459 --> 01:10:40,495
I told the housekeeper to get Warner.

812
01:10:40,661 --> 01:10:42,832
Lieutenant Anderson
will want to know about this.

813
01:10:43,164 --> 01:10:44,008
Hello?

814
01:10:44,279 --> 01:10:46,918
Yeah, this is Davenport
at the Oaks, we got trouble here.

815
01:10:48,003 --> 01:10:50,928
Well, for one thing I was drugged. Yeah.

816
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:55,059
But I must've been knocked out, because the
maid tells me Miss Van Gorder is missing.

817
01:10:55,993 --> 01:10:57,983
You better call Anderson and let him know.

818
01:10:58,979 --> 01:11:00,879
He's not at home? Well, where is he?

819
01:11:02,145 --> 01:11:03,954
Out on a case? What case?

820
01:11:05,024 --> 01:11:06,321
Dr. Wells?

821
01:11:07,165 --> 01:11:08,552
What else did they tell you about him?

822
01:11:08,778 --> 01:11:12,170
Oh hurry, will you?
We got to find Miss Cornelia!

823
01:11:14,235 --> 01:11:15,125
Ok.

824
01:11:15,924 --> 01:11:17,944
Lieutenant Anderson is out on a case.

825
01:11:18,291 --> 01:11:21,939
Dr. Wells was found dead in a
room next to his garage, murdered.

826
01:11:22,964 --> 01:11:24,471
Dr. Wells?

827
01:11:24,728 --> 01:11:28,316
There's something queer about the killing of
Wells but headquarters won't talk about it.

828
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:31,692
Lizzie, Warner isn't in his room,
there's no sign of him anywhere.

829
01:11:31,722 --> 01:11:33,758
And I was supposed to
keep an eye on that guy.

830
01:11:33,788 --> 01:11:36,819
Where is Miss Cornelia?
That's what I want to know!

831
01:11:36,999 --> 01:11:40,663
Wait a minute, didn't you say that the chain
and the bolt were off of the front door?

832
01:11:40,693 --> 01:11:43,843
- I certainly did.
- Well, maybe Miss Van Gorder went outside.

833
01:11:43,873 --> 01:11:46,737
Oh, she never would, we better look.

834
01:11:47,973 --> 01:11:52,707
I can't, I can't breathe, there's no air.

835
01:12:00,743 --> 01:12:02,281
Miss Cornelia?

836
01:12:02,537 --> 01:12:04,617
- Miss Van Gorder?
- Miss Cornelia?

837
01:12:04,647 --> 01:12:06,366
- Miss Cornelia?
- Miss Van Gorder?

838
01:12:06,396 --> 01:12:10,248
Look, there's a light in that
room on the third floor.

839
01:12:10,896 --> 01:12:12,064
Were you up there tonight?

840
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:15,268
Well, of course I was, but I turned the
lights out before I came downstairs.

841
01:12:15,298 --> 01:12:17,528
Miss Cornelia might've turned them on again.

842
01:12:17,558 --> 01:12:19,790
That's where we're
going to look first, come on.

843
01:12:40,911 --> 01:12:44,861
Cornelia? Cornelia?

844
01:12:46,281 --> 01:12:50,758
- Miss Cornelia?
- Yes I'm, I'm here.

845
01:12:54,617 --> 01:12:57,557
Right here!

846
01:13:01,072 --> 01:13:03,209
Here we are Miss Van
Gorder, what do we do now?

847
01:13:03,525 --> 01:13:07,083
Over the mantle, there are five panels.

848
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:10,625
Strike it, with your hands.

849
01:13:15,027 --> 01:13:19,067
- Which panel did you say Miss Van Gorder?
- Oh I, I just...

850
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:23,379
Miss Van Gorder, which panel?
We couldn't hear you!

851
01:13:23,409 --> 01:13:28,128
She said strike it, what difference does
it make which panel? Strike them all.

852
01:13:30,811 --> 01:13:31,881
Look!

853
01:13:45,033 --> 01:13:51,945
Oh, it's all right now,
it's all right dear, Lizzie's here.

854
01:13:57,779 --> 01:13:59,301
- Feeling better?
- Yes, much better.

855
01:13:59,331 --> 01:14:00,256
We'll take you to your room.

856
01:14:00,266 --> 01:14:03,293
Oh, no you wont, I'm going to
stay right here, I'm quite all right.

857
01:14:03,875 --> 01:14:07,119
Oh, how blessed it is to
breathe without an effort, you know...

858
01:14:07,435 --> 01:14:12,278
no one knows how sweet the air can taste
until someone shuts it off for a moment.

859
01:14:12,641 --> 01:14:14,829
That room is just like a box.

860
01:14:15,432 --> 01:14:19,138
When the mantle piece closed, it
seemed like all the air was drawn out of it.

861
01:14:19,716 --> 01:14:21,089
Look, there's goes again!

862
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:23,531
Let it close, I can open it from in here.

863
01:14:28,016 --> 01:14:30,358
There's a control
panel behind this blueprint.

864
01:14:30,998 --> 01:14:33,086
Electric motor under the trap door here.

865
01:14:33,508 --> 01:14:35,681
Once the door is open
you can keep it that way.

866
01:14:36,912 --> 01:14:40,328
I believe that the fireplace in
this other room opens the same way.

867
01:14:42,573 --> 01:14:43,756
And it does.

868
01:14:46,496 --> 01:14:48,463
I tried to find this but I couldn't find it.

869
01:14:48,493 --> 01:14:52,108
Yeah, it's back of this blueprint here.
Well, it's, it's quite a set up.

870
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:55,669
Too bad we can't open that safe the same way.

871
01:14:56,574 --> 01:15:00,206
Take an expert to crack
this box or a shot of nitro.

872
01:15:00,412 --> 01:15:02,359
Maybe, maybe that's what the Bat had in mind.

873
01:15:02,389 --> 01:15:04,830
Could be, seems he's on the prowl tonight.

874
01:15:05,035 --> 01:15:07,449
Miss Van Gorder, Warner has disappeared.

875
01:15:07,479 --> 01:15:09,586
- Really?
- And Dr. Wells is been murdered.

876
01:15:10,226 --> 01:15:11,373
Dr. Wells?

877
01:15:11,639 --> 01:15:13,703
Lieutenant Anderson is
on that case right now.

878
01:15:14,028 --> 01:15:15,887
Oh, does he know what happened here tonight?

879
01:15:15,917 --> 01:15:18,120
They got word to him,
he'll be here any minute.

880
01:15:29,467 --> 01:15:31,012
What's that noise?

881
01:15:31,893 --> 01:15:35,478
- Miss Van Gorder, the garage is on fire.
- Great scotch, look at that.

882
01:15:35,707 --> 01:15:37,868
Lizzie, put that light out in the other room.

883
01:15:38,097 --> 01:15:39,244
Now, where are you going?

884
01:15:39,678 --> 01:15:42,044
- To report the fire.
- Well, you just stay right here.

885
01:15:42,074 --> 01:15:45,352
- But Miss Van Gorder, the garage?
- Well, let it burn, go watch the stairs.

886
01:15:45,695 --> 01:15:47,922
Can't you see that fire was
set to get us out of the house.

887
01:15:47,952 --> 01:15:52,316
- Out of the, you're talking about the...
- Yes, yes, I'm talking about the Bat.

888
01:15:52,619 --> 01:15:56,046
Now that the lights are out, he'll think
his trick has worked and we've gone.

889
01:15:56,076 --> 01:15:56,867
He'll be here any minute.

890
01:15:56,897 --> 01:16:00,319
- Well, so will Lieutenant Anderson.
- I hope so, but the Bat will be here first.

891
01:16:00,349 --> 01:16:04,472
And he'll kill again if we're in his
way, we got to be as clever as he is.

892
01:17:16,714 --> 01:17:19,458
But you'll be safer
downstairs, I'll take care of him.

893
01:17:19,488 --> 01:17:21,523
Well, the others can go
but I'm going to stay right here.

894
01:17:21,839 --> 01:17:23,633
All right, but get out of sight.

895
01:17:50,226 --> 01:17:52,487
Let's face it ladies and get it over with.

896
01:17:53,211 --> 01:17:57,356
Others have seen my face before they died
but I'll have to deny you that pleasure.

897
01:17:57,974 --> 01:18:00,989
This would make a good scene
for your book Miss Van Gorder.

898
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,673
But I'm afraid you'll never write it.

899
01:18:08,149 --> 01:18:12,099
That is Warner, I could tell.

900
01:18:15,823 --> 01:18:18,928
- You misjudge me Miss Ellen.
- Warner!

901
01:18:21,684 --> 01:18:24,597
I don't like being a murder
suspect Miss Van Gorder.

902
01:18:25,351 --> 01:18:29,904
I was headed for a plane but halfway to the
airport I changed my mind and came back.

903
01:18:30,809 --> 01:18:32,226
I'm glad that I did.

904
01:18:45,959 --> 01:18:48,191
Why, it's Lieutenant Anderson!

905
01:18:54,041 --> 01:18:55,699
Yes, it was Anderson.

906
01:18:57,055 --> 01:19:00,507
He discovered the secret of the hidden
room and was waiting to get into it...

907
01:19:01,035 --> 01:19:03,447
and open up the safe.

908
01:19:03,869 --> 01:19:09,040
We found the money in it, little over a
million in tens and twenties and hundreds.

909
01:19:12,266 --> 01:19:18,990
Good old Andy, with all his ill
gotten gains invested in bank stock.

910
01:19:19,881 --> 01:19:22,639
It's rather a clever
way to hide stolen money...

911
01:19:23,061 --> 01:19:27,508
in the open, as it were and so respectable.

912
01:19:29,137 --> 01:19:30,674
But don't try it.

913
01:19:31,911 --> 01:19:38,680
No matter how clever you
are, you can't hide murder.

914
01:19:45,511 --> 01:19:48,827
Well, that's it Dale.

915
01:19:49,687 --> 01:19:51,398
That's the end.
