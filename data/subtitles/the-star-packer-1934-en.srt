-Oh, where is the
 foreman and your boys?

167
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:44,242
-They were in with the rustlers
 and left with the cattle.

168
00:22:44,242 --> 00:22:45,299
-And you live here alone.

169

-Yes, except for
 old Jake the cook.

170
00:22:56,231 --> 00:22:58,167
-I'm going over to Matlock's.

171

Now you stay here and keep
 an eye on whoever passes.

172
00:23:15,037 --> 00:23:17,081
-Under the circumstances, I
 think we should try and dispose

173
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:21,014
of this ranch, or at least
 let me buy your half.

174
00:23:21,014 --> 00:23:24,023
This is certainly no
 place for a woman.

-Oh, I quite agree with
 you there, Uncle Matt.

 find it like this.

-How many for
 supper, Mr. Matlock?

178
00:23:31,956 --> 00:23:33,907
-Just the three of us, Jake.

179
00:23:33,907 --> 00:23:34,930
-Thank you, sir.

 someone, Uncle Matt.

-Well, it's our new sheriff.

Come right in, Mr. Travers.

184
00:23:56,732 --> 00:23:57,710
Miss Matlock.

-How do you do?

186
00:23:58,716 --> 00:24:00,708
-Just wanted to tell
 you about my good luck.

187
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:03,669
I found the express money
 near the scene of the hold up.

188

-Well, that is good luck.

189
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,653
Did you see any
 sign of the robbers?

190
00:24:07,653 --> 00:24:10,665

 make any promises

192

But I hope to have the Shadow
 and his gang behind the bars,

193
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:16,634
in a very few days.

194

-Well my boy, I
 certainly wish you luck.

But I'm afraid that
 never can happen.

The Shadow is clever.

197
00:24:23,576 --> 00:24:27,479
His men are the most desperate
 criminals ever banded together.

198

-How do you know?

199
00:24:28,544 --> 00:24:32,530
-Why, uh, the cold-blooded
 manner in which they operate.

200
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:35,436
-Oh, I see.

201

But I still think I can do it.

Will you excuse me a moment?

204
00:24:45,366 --> 00:24:48,376
-I suppose you're glad to
 be home again, Miss Matlock.

-Well, this isn't
 exactly my home.

In fact, it's the first
 time I've seen the place.

You see my father and
 Uncle Matt own this ranch.

And two years ago
 dad was killed.

 offered to buy me out.

 happen here at night.

And there are only
 the three of us,

 Matt, and myself.
