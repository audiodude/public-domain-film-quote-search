1
00:02:22,647 --> 00:02:25,406
Yeah, D.B.? Cleaning out deadwood.

2
00:02:25,774 --> 00:02:27,005
Okay.

3
00:02:27,618 --> 00:02:30,584
Mr. Connell I can't afford
to be without work right now.

4
00:02:30,746 --> 00:02:31,976
Not even for a day.

5
00:02:32,149 --> 00:02:34,031
I've got a mother
and two kid sisters.

6
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,756
More 'good luck' telegrams.

7
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,994
You know how it is.

8
00:02:38,164 --> 00:02:40,205
I've got to keep on working, see?

9
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,524
Sorry, sister. I was sent
down here to clean house.

10
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:45,090
I told you I can't use
your column anymore.

11
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:46,298
It's lavender and old lace.

12
00:02:46,463 --> 00:02:47,616
Send those other people in.

13
00:02:47,787 --> 00:02:48,860
I'll tell you what I'll do.

14
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:52,873
I get 30 dollars a week.
I'll take 25, 20 if necessary.

15
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,480
- I'll do anything you say.
- It isn't the money.

16
00:02:55,646 --> 00:02:59,284
We're after circulation, fireworks.
People that hit with sledgehammers,

17
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,607
start arguments.

18
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:02,260
I can do that.
I know this town inside out.

19
00:03:02,422 --> 00:03:04,896
- Give me a chance, please.
- Alright, come in.

20
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,273
Cashier's got your check.

21
00:03:07,435 --> 00:03:08,836
Who are these people?

22
00:03:09,078 --> 00:03:11,314
Gibbs, Crawley,
Cunningham, Giles.

23
00:03:12,084 --> 00:03:13,076
Hey you, sister!

24
00:03:13,248 --> 00:03:16,053
Don't forget your last column
before you pick up your check.

25
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,980
You're a couple of sticks shy
on your column, ma'am.

26
00:03:37,146 --> 00:03:40,830
Big rich slob like D.B. Norton buys
a paper and chops 40 heads off.

27
00:03:40,996 --> 00:03:43,720
- Did you get it too?
- You too?

28
00:03:45,046 --> 00:03:48,169
Joe, I'm sorry darling.

29
00:03:48,492 --> 00:03:50,489
Let's we tear the building down.

30
00:03:50,658 --> 00:03:53,258
Before you do, you better
finish this column.

31
00:03:53,425 --> 00:03:55,546
Lavender and old lace.

32
00:03:57,193 --> 00:03:59,109
Wait, Joe. Wait.

33
00:04:03,007 --> 00:04:04,890
Wants fireworks, huh?

34
00:04:05,895 --> 00:04:07,217
Okay.

35
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:25,451
Here.

36
00:04:26,704 --> 00:04:29,271
"Below is a letter which
reached my desk this morning.

37
00:04:29,431 --> 00:04:32,636
It's a commentary on what we
laughingly call a 'civilized world'.

38
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:36,597
Dear Miss Mitchell, 4 years ago
I was fired out of my job.

39
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,764
Since then I haven't had another.

40
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:41,501
At first I was sore at
the State Administration because

41
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,583
it's on account of slimy politics
we have all this unemployment.

42
00:04:46,794 --> 00:04:49,678
But in looking around, it seems
the whole world's going to pot.

43
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,809
In protest, I'm committing suicide
by jumping of the City Hall roof.

44
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,969
Signed, a disgusted
American citizen: John Doe."

45
00:04:57,378 --> 00:05:00,057
Editor's note:
"If you ask this column,

46
00:05:00,224 --> 00:05:03,110
the wrong people
are jumping of the roofs."

47
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:06,240
Ann, this is the
old fake-a-roo, isn't it?

48
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,360
Never mind that, go ahead.

49
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:32,301
"...because of slimy politics

50
00:05:32,463 --> 00:05:34,743
that we have
all this unemployment."

51
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:38,348
There it is. D.B Norton's
opening attack on the Governor.

52
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:40,753
Why Jim, it's just a letter
sent into a column.

53
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,919
No, I can smell it. That's Norton.

54
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:46,208
Good morning, gentleman.
You're here rather early.

55
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:48,941
Governor, did you happen to see
the new Bulletin?

56
00:05:50,868 --> 00:05:52,543
Yes, I had it served with breakfast.

57
00:05:52,711 --> 00:05:55,277
- Jim thinks it's D.B. Norton.
- Of course it is.

58
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,840
Come, Jim. That little item?

59
00:05:57,002 --> 00:05:59,967
D.B. Norton does things
in a much bigger way.

60
00:06:00,128 --> 00:06:03,494
It's his opening attack on you,
Governor. Take my word for it.

61
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:05,539
What did he buy a paper for?

62
00:06:05,702 --> 00:06:08,017
Why did he engage a
high pressure editor like Connell?

63
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:11,553
He's in the oil business.
Governor, he's after your scalp.

64
00:06:11,717 --> 00:06:15,000
Alright, Jim.
Don't burst a blood vessel.

65
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:17,526
- I'll look into it.
- Yes, sir?

66
00:06:17,692 --> 00:06:20,370
Get me Spencer
of the Daily Chronicle, please.

67
00:06:20,538 --> 00:06:24,382
Yes, I saw it, Governor.
If you ask me, it's a phony letter.

68
00:06:24,548 --> 00:06:26,543
That gag's got whiskers on it.

69
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:30,759
I'll get the Mayor and Chamber
of Commerce to go after them.

70
00:06:31,203 --> 00:06:32,961
Get Mayor Lovett on the phone.

71
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,443
Sorry, the Mayor's busy
on the other phone.

72
00:06:35,615 --> 00:06:38,613
Yes, I know, Mrs. Brewster, it's
a terrible reflection on our city.

73
00:06:38,782 --> 00:06:41,906
- I've had a dozen calls already.
- Spencer at the Chronicle.

74
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,983
Just a minute.

75
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,828
Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.

76
00:06:44,997 --> 00:06:48,885
I insist that this John Doe
be found a job at once.

77
00:06:49,046 --> 00:06:51,728
If something isn't done,
I'll call out the whole Auxiliary.

78
00:06:51,894 --> 00:06:54,414
And the Junior Auxiliary.
We'll hold a meeting

79
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,062
and see that it is...

80
00:06:56,223 --> 00:06:58,106
Yes, Spency? Who?

81
00:06:58,269 --> 00:06:59,226
The Governor?

82
00:06:59,392 --> 00:07:03,190
It's my building he jumping off!
And I'm up for re-election.

83
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:05,516
What? Get Connell at the Bulletin.

84
00:07:05,687 --> 00:07:07,922
Why, he's liable to go
right past my win...

85
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:09,815
- What was that?
- What?

86
00:07:10,057 --> 00:07:12,452
- The window. Something flew by.
- I didn't see anything.

87
00:07:12,624 --> 00:07:15,588
Don't stand there, you idiot.
Go and look. Open the window.

88
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:18,427
Why did he have to
pick my building?

89
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:22,394
Is there a crowd in the street?
Maybe he's caught on a ledge.

90
00:07:23,851 --> 00:07:26,210
- It must have been a seagull.
- A seagull?

91
00:07:26,376 --> 00:07:28,943
What's a seagull doing
around the City Hall?

92
00:07:29,103 --> 00:07:32,787
- That's a bad omen, isn't it?
- No, the seagull's a lovely bird.

93
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:36,032
It's alright, Mrs. Brewster.
It's just a seagull.

94
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,922
Nothing's happened yet.
I'm watching.

95
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:40,764
Don't worry.
Leave it all to me.

96
00:07:40,931 --> 00:07:42,414
Spencer, I'll call you back.

97
00:07:42,937 --> 00:07:44,453
Hello, Connell?

98
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:47,462
This is... What are you doing?
This is the Mayor.

99
00:07:47,628 --> 00:07:49,988
Yes, Mayor Lovett.
How many times you gonna call me?

100
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:53,033
I've got everybody and his
brother and sister looking for him.

101
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:55,077
See the box I'm running?

102
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,610
"An appeal to John Doe.
Think it over, John.

103
00:07:59,776 --> 00:08:02,092
Life can be beautiful,
says Mayor.

104
00:08:02,262 --> 00:08:05,581
If you need a job, apply to
the editor and so forth..."

105
00:08:06,193 --> 00:08:08,997
Okay, Mayor, I'll let you know
as soon as I have something.

106
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:10,390
What?

107
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:12,479
Well, pull down the blinds.

108
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:15,527
Went up to Miss Mitchell's house.
Boy, she's in a bad way.

109
00:08:16,056 --> 00:08:18,975
- Where is she?
- Supports her mother and two kids.

110
00:08:19,143 --> 00:08:21,617
- Did you find her?
- No. Her mother's worried.

111
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,108
She said she was going on
a roaring drunk, the girl I mean.

112
00:08:25,278 --> 00:08:26,430
Go out and find her.

113
00:08:27,323 --> 00:08:29,968
The biggest thing I didn't tell ya.
Her old man's Doc Mitchell.

114
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:33,369
He saved my mother's life
and wouldn't take money for it.

115
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:35,579
Okay, Boss. I'll look for her.

116
00:08:39,232 --> 00:08:41,798
Holy smokes, Commissioner.
You've had 24 hours.

117
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:45,882
Okay, Hawkshaw, grab a pencil.
Here it is again.

118
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:50,168
About 5 foot five, brown eyes,

119
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:52,094
chestnut hair...

120
00:08:52,543 --> 00:08:54,426
and as fine a pair of legs as...

121
00:08:55,472 --> 00:08:57,591
ever walked into this office.

122
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:01,763
- Do you want to see me?
- No.

123
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:04,448
I've had the whole Army
and Navy searching for you

124
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:06,096
because it's a game we play.

125
00:09:06,256 --> 00:09:07,978
I remember distinctly being fired.

126
00:09:08,142 --> 00:09:11,984
That's right, but you have property
that belongs to this newspaper.

127
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,428
- What's that?
- The letter.

128
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:14,996
- What letter?
- The letter from John Doe.

129
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:19,758
The town's in an uproar, we got to
find it. It's the only clue.

130
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:22,655
- There is no letter.
- We'll get a handwriting expert to...

131
00:09:23,658 --> 00:09:25,221
- What?
- There is no letter.

132
00:09:29,072 --> 00:09:31,511
- Say that again.
- I made it up.

133
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,515
You made it up.

134
00:09:33,682 --> 00:09:35,484
You said you wanted fireworks.

135
00:09:35,647 --> 00:09:38,488
Don't you know there are
9 jobs waiting for this guy,

136
00:09:38,655 --> 00:09:40,490
22 families want to
board him free,

137
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:44,183
5 women want to marry him
and the Mayor's ready to adopt him?

138
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:47,268
- Just called the morgue. A girl...
- Shut up!

139
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:50,193
Ann! Why didn't you...?

140
00:09:50,363 --> 00:09:53,967
Only one thing to do, Hank.
Drop the whole business quickly.

141
00:09:54,132 --> 00:09:56,606
Run a story.
Say John Doe was in here,

142
00:09:56,777 --> 00:09:58,534
and is sorry he wrote the letter...

143
00:09:58,704 --> 00:10:01,428
Sure. He came in here and
I made him change his mind.

144
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,349
"Bulletin Editor saves
John Doe's life." It's perfect.

145
00:10:04,517 --> 00:10:05,669
I'll have Ned write it up.

146
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,681
- Ned, I got a story...
- Wait a minute.

147
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,926
Listen, you great big
genius of a newspaperman.

148
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:14,661
You came to shoot some life
into this dying newspaper.

149
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,262
Well, the whole town's
curious about John Doe and boom!

150
00:10:17,427 --> 00:10:18,911
You're going to bury him.

151
00:10:19,071 --> 00:10:22,115
There's enough circulation in
that man to start an ink shortage.

152
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,761
- In what man?
- John Doe.

153
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,763
- What John Doe?
- Ours. The one I made up.

154
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,812
Look genius. Now, look.

155
00:10:29,136 --> 00:10:32,853
Suppose a John Doe walked into
this office? What would you do?

156
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:35,625
Find him a job and
forget the whole business, huh?

157
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:37,832
Not me.
I'd make a deal with him.

158
00:10:37,997 --> 00:10:38,954
A deal?

159
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,005
You don't drop a stunt to
sell papers like a hot potato.

160
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:44,688
This is good for a couple of months.
Know what I'd do?

161
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:48,377
Between now and Christmas,
when he jumps, I'd run a daily yawn.

162
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:51,109
Starting with his boyhood,
his schooling, his first job.

163
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,743
A wide-eyed youngster
facing a chaotic world.

164
00:10:53,915 --> 00:10:56,481
The problem of the average man,
all the John Does.

165
00:10:56,642 --> 00:10:59,847
Then comes the drama.
He meets discouragement.

166
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:02,086
He finds the world has
feet of clay, his ideals crumble.

167
00:11:02,256 --> 00:11:04,822
What does he do? He decides to

168
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:06,817
commit suicide in protest
against the state of civilization.

169
00:11:06,987 --> 00:11:09,462
He thinks of the river, but no.
He has a better idea:

170
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:12,518
The City Hall. Why?
He wants to attract attention.

171
00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:16,204
He want to get things off his chest
and it's the only way to be heard.

172
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,202
- So?
- So?

173
00:11:17,373 --> 00:11:19,653
So he writes me a letter
and I dig him up.

174
00:11:19,818 --> 00:11:22,577
He pours out his soul to me.
From now on we quote:

175
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:24,661
"I Protest", by John Doe.

176
00:11:24,831 --> 00:11:27,304
He protests against
all the evils in the world.

177
00:11:27,476 --> 00:11:30,556
The greed, lust, hate, fear.
All of man's inhumanity to man.

178
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:33,962
Arguments will start.
Should he commit suicide or not?

179
00:11:34,131 --> 00:11:36,732
People will write in,
pleading with him. But no, sir!

180
00:11:36,898 --> 00:11:38,415
John Doe will remain adamant.

181
00:11:38,582 --> 00:11:42,221
On Christmas Eve,
hot or cold, he goes, see?

182
00:11:44,476 --> 00:11:47,395
Very pretty, very pretty indeed,
Miss Mitchell.

183
00:11:47,564 --> 00:11:50,484
But would you mind telling me
who goes on Christmas Eve?

184
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:52,088
- John Doe
- What John Doe?

185
00:11:52,255 --> 00:11:53,897
The one we hire
for the job, you lunkhead.

186
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,299
Wait a minute. Let me get this
through this lame brain of mine.

187
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:01,431
We hire someone who says they'll
commit suicide on Christmas Eve?

188
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:02,829
Now you're catching on.

189
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:05,921
- Who for instance?
- Anybody. Beany'll do.

190
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:09,213
Why sure.
Who me? Jump off a...

191
00:12:09,377 --> 00:12:11,772
Anytime but Christmas.
I'm superstitious.

192
00:12:17,116 --> 00:12:21,084
Do me a favor. Go on out and
get married, have babies but...

193
00:12:21,245 --> 00:12:22,567
stay out of the newspaper business.

194
00:12:22,729 --> 00:12:24,963
Better get that story in hand.
It's getting late.

195
00:12:25,134 --> 00:12:27,780
You're supposed to be a smart guy.
If it was raining 100 dollar bills,

196
00:12:27,942 --> 00:12:30,542
you'd be looking for
a dime you lost someplace.

197
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,181
Holy smokes. Wasting my time
listening to this mad woman.

198
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:36,273
Look what the Chronicle's running
on John Doe. They say it's a fake.

199
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,278
Why the no-good...

200
00:12:39,128 --> 00:12:41,602
"John Doe story,
amateur journalism.

201
00:12:41,775 --> 00:12:45,058
This is so phony, it's a wonder
anyone's taking it seriously."

202
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,343
- What do you think of those guys?
- That's fine. That's fine.

203
00:12:47,508 --> 00:12:50,075
Now fall into their laps. Go ahead.

204
00:12:50,235 --> 00:12:52,550
Say John Doe walked in
and called the whole thing off.

205
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,875
You know what that'll sound like.

206
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:57,121
- That's all, Ned. Thank you.
- All right.

207
00:12:58,454 --> 00:13:00,450
Amateur journalism, huh?

208
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,501
That bunch of sophomores.

209
00:13:02,664 --> 00:13:05,791
- I could teach them more...
- Boss! Get a load of this.

210
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,436
- What?
- Look.

211
00:13:11,126 --> 00:13:12,117
What do they want?

212
00:13:12,288 --> 00:13:15,207
- They say they wrote the letter.
- Yeah, I wrote it, Boss.

213
00:13:15,415 --> 00:13:16,933
They all wrote the letter.

214
00:13:17,099 --> 00:13:20,817
Tell them all to wait.
One is your John Doe.

215
00:13:20,989 --> 00:13:22,985
They're desperate and will
do anything for a cup of coffee.

216
00:13:23,155 --> 00:13:25,880
Pick one and you can make
the Chronicle eat their words.

217
00:13:26,483 --> 00:13:27,714
I'm beginning to like this.

218
00:13:27,886 --> 00:13:30,451
If you ask me, Hank,
you're playing with dynamite.

219
00:13:30,612 --> 00:13:32,128
No, the girl's right.

220
00:13:32,295 --> 00:13:34,097
We can't let the Chronicle
get the laugh on us.

221
00:13:34,261 --> 00:13:35,902
We've got to produce
a John Doe now.

222
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,870
Amateur journalism, huh?
I'll show those guys.

223
00:13:39,032 --> 00:13:41,952
Sure and there's no reason
for them to find out the truth

224
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,400
because naturally
I won't say anything.

225
00:13:45,968 --> 00:13:48,934
- Okay, you get your job back.
- Plus a bonus.

226
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:51,172
- What bonus?
- The bonus of 1,000 dollars...

227
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:53,816
the Chronicle was going to
pay me for this little document.

228
00:13:53,988 --> 00:13:57,991
"I, Ann Mitchell, certify that the
John Doe letter was created by me..."

229
00:13:58,158 --> 00:14:00,233
- I can read. I can read.
- Sorry.

230
00:14:02,087 --> 00:14:04,288
You think this is worth
1,000 dollars, do ya?

231
00:14:04,454 --> 00:14:06,449
The Chronicle would
consider it dirt cheap.

232
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,935
Packs everything including a gun.

233
00:14:09,465 --> 00:14:12,944
Okay, sister, you got a deal.
Let's look at the candidates.

234
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:15,150
The one we pick has got to be
the typical, average man.

235
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,675
Typical American
that can keep his mouth shut.

236
00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:20,844
Show me an American who can keep
his mouth shut and I'll eat him.

237
00:14:22,658 --> 00:14:24,492
Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.

238
00:15:28,816 --> 00:15:30,731
Did you write that letter?

239
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,982
- No, I didn't.
- What are you doing here then?

240
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,108
Paper says there were jobs.
Might be one left over.

241
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,915
Had any schooling?

242
00:15:40,444 --> 00:15:41,960
Yeah. A little.

243
00:15:42,248 --> 00:15:43,731
What do you do when you work?

244
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:45,929
- I used to pitch.
- Baseball?

245
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:49,020
Yeah, till my wing went bad.

246
00:15:49,186 --> 00:15:50,382
Where did you play?

247
00:15:51,349 --> 00:15:52,673
Bush leagues, mostly.

248
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:55,638
- Family? Got any family?
- No.

249
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,277
- Just traveling through?
- Yeah.

250
00:15:58,527 --> 00:16:00,922
Me and a friend of mine.
He's outside.

251
00:16:04,944 --> 00:16:07,462
- Looks alright.
- He's perfect. A baseball player.

252
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,385
What could be more American?

253
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:12,632
- Wish he had a family.
- Be less complicated without.

254
00:16:12,802 --> 00:16:13,954
Look at that face. It's wonderful.

255
00:16:14,326 --> 00:16:16,366
They'll believe him. Come on.

256
00:16:18,456 --> 00:16:21,260
- What's your name.
- John Willoughby.

257
00:16:21,422 --> 00:16:23,862
Long John Willoughby
they called me in baseball.

258
00:16:24,028 --> 00:16:26,548
Would you like to make some money?

259
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,761
Yeah... maybe.

260
00:16:31,326 --> 00:16:34,850
Would you be willing to say you
wrote that letter and stick by it?

261
00:16:40,027 --> 00:16:41,669
I get the idea.

262
00:16:42,313 --> 00:16:44,229
Yeah. Maybe.

263
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,130
That's our man.
He's made to order.

264
00:16:51,294 --> 00:16:53,416
He don't seem like the guy
that'd fall in line.

265
00:16:53,581 --> 00:16:56,020
When you're desperate for money,
you do a lot of things.

266
00:16:56,186 --> 00:16:58,946
He's our man I tell you.
He's fainted.

267
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:00,990
Get some water, quickly!

268
00:17:01,158 --> 00:17:02,036
Hurry up, Hop.

269
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,958
Right here, sit down.

270
00:17:04,126 --> 00:17:06,280
- You alright?
- Yeah, I'm alright.

271
00:17:07,533 --> 00:17:09,050
How many is that, six?

272
00:17:19,202 --> 00:17:20,717
Pretty hungry, weren't you?

273
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,729
All this John Doe business
is batty, if you ask me.

274
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:27,333
Well nobody asked you.

275
00:17:27,701 --> 00:17:30,268
Trying to improve the world
by jumping off buildings.

276
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:32,583
You couldn't improve the world
if the buildings jumped on you.

277
00:17:33,436 --> 00:17:35,191
Don't mind the Colonel.
He hates people.

278
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,361
Likes you enough to stick around.

279
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,966
'Cause we both play doohickeys.

280
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:43,776
I met him in a boxcar
a couple of years ago.

281
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:47,065
I was fooling around with
my harmonica and he joins in.

282
00:17:47,228 --> 00:17:49,191
Haven't shaken him since.

283
00:18:10,645 --> 00:18:13,564
- Alright boys, here he is.
- No, you can't take photos of him

284
00:18:13,732 --> 00:18:15,694
eating a sandwich
and with a beard.

285
00:18:15,857 --> 00:18:18,217
- He's going to jump off a building.
- Not because he's out of a job.

286
00:18:18,383 --> 00:18:20,984
That's not news.
He's jumping out of principle.

287
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,268
Maybe you're right.

288
00:18:22,473 --> 00:18:25,313
We clean him up, put him in a hotel
under bodyguard. Make a mystery.

289
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:28,285
- Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
- Thinks it's terrific.

290
00:18:28,448 --> 00:18:31,014
Wants us to build a bonfire under
every big shot in the state.

291
00:18:31,174 --> 00:18:32,930
- Swell. Is that the contract?
- Yeah.

292
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,305
- What's he doing here?
- Friend of his. They play duets.

293
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:38,427
Duets? Can we trust him?

294
00:18:38,591 --> 00:18:39,915
I trust him.

295
00:18:40,076 --> 00:18:42,801
You trust him, eh?
I'm suppose he trusts you too.

296
00:18:42,962 --> 00:18:44,845
Stop worrying. He's all right.

297
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,047
Okay, but we don't want more than
a hundred people in on this.

298
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,296
First, I want an exact copy
of the John Doe letter

299
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:52,183
in your own handwriting.

300
00:18:52,345 --> 00:18:53,747
I got it already. Here.

301
00:18:53,908 --> 00:18:55,140
That's fine.

302
00:18:55,553 --> 00:18:57,947
Now sign this agreement.

303
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:01,004
It gives us an exclusive story
under your name, day by day

304
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:03,082
from now until Christmas.

305
00:19:03,532 --> 00:19:06,099
On December 26th,
you get one railroad ticket

306
00:19:06,258 --> 00:19:07,854
out of town.

307
00:19:08,262 --> 00:19:10,943
The Bulletin pays to have
your arm fixed. It's what you want?

308
00:19:11,111 --> 00:19:13,026
Yeah, but it's got to be by
Bone-setter Brown.

309
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:16,000
Okay, Bone-setter Brown goes.
Here, sign it.

310
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:18,364
Meanwhile, here's
50 dollars spending money.

311
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:20,364
That's fine. Beany?

312
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:24,093
Take charge of him. A suite at
the Imperial and bodyguards.

313
00:19:24,261 --> 00:19:25,745
And some new clothes.

314
00:19:25,906 --> 00:19:28,061
- Think we better have him deloused?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

315
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:31,150
- Both of them?
- Yes, but don't lose them.

316
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:33,599
- Beany, gray suit, huh?
- Yeah.

317
00:19:33,765 --> 00:19:34,917
Okay, fellas.

318
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:41,742
Take it easy, John Doe.

319
00:19:45,153 --> 00:19:47,878
And you start pounding
that typewriter.

320
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:50,639
This is terrific.
No responsibilities on our part,

321
00:19:50,806 --> 00:19:53,200
just statements from John Doe
and we can blast our heads off.

322
00:19:53,371 --> 00:19:57,168
Before you pop your buttons,
don't forget that check for 1,000.

323
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:58,864
Yeah.

324
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,636
Okay, fellas, you sit outside
and nobody comes in.

325
00:20:03,797 --> 00:20:05,952
You two fellas sit in here.

326
00:20:06,323 --> 00:20:07,964
Pretty nifty, huh?

327
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,966
- You won't get me to stay here.
- Sure you are.

328
00:20:12,137 --> 00:20:15,616
No. Under the bridge, where we slept
last night is good enough for me.

329
00:20:16,227 --> 00:20:18,542
- What do I do with this baggage?
- Stick it in the bedroom.

330
00:20:18,713 --> 00:20:20,355
Give me mine. I ain't staying.

331
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,675
We were headed for
the Columbia River country

332
00:20:23,845 --> 00:20:26,889
before this John Doe business
came up. You remember don't ya?

333
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:28,170
Sure, I remember.

334
00:20:28,336 --> 00:20:30,537
Did your ears pop coming up
in the elevator? Mine did.

335
00:20:30,701 --> 00:20:32,618
Long John, I tell ya.
It's no good.

336
00:20:32,787 --> 00:20:34,827
You'll get used to a lot of stuff
that's gonna wreck you.

337
00:20:34,991 --> 00:20:37,991
That 50 bucks in your pocket
is beginning to show up on you.

338
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,802
Don't pull that on me neither.

339
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:42,483
Stop worrying. I'll get my arm
fixed out of this.

340
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,090
Here's some cigars
the boss sent us. Have one.

341
00:20:45,256 --> 00:20:47,058
- Colonel?
- No.

342
00:20:56,844 --> 00:20:59,570
I bet even the major leaguers
don't rate an outfit like this.

343
00:20:59,731 --> 00:21:01,327
Make yourself comfortable.
Paper?

344
00:21:02,498 --> 00:21:05,462
I don't read no papers and
I don't listen to radios neither.

345
00:21:05,746 --> 00:21:09,224
World's been shaved by a
drunken barber. Don't have to read.

346
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,917
I've seen guys like you go under.

347
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:18,085
Guys that never had a worry,
got some money and went goofy.

348
00:21:18,256 --> 00:21:19,818
First thing that happens to a guy...

349
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:21,816
- Get a load of the bedroom.
- No.

350
00:21:22,586 --> 00:21:25,951
First thing that happens is he
starts wanting to go to restaurants

351
00:21:26,396 --> 00:21:30,363
and eat salad
and cupcakes and tea.

352
00:21:30,926 --> 00:21:32,523
What that kind of food
does to your system.

353
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:40,901
Next, the dope wants a room.

354
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,146
A room with steam heat,

355
00:21:43,316 --> 00:21:44,752
and curtains and rugs.

356
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,965
He softens up till he
can't sleep unless he has a bed.

357
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,169
Stop worrying, Colonel.
50 bucks ain't gonna ruin me.

358
00:21:51,336 --> 00:21:53,331
I've seen plenty of fellas
start out with 50 bucks

359
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,336
and wind up with
a bank account.

360
00:21:55,505 --> 00:21:56,988
What's the matter
with a bank account, anyway?

361
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,911
Let me tell you, Long John,
when you got a bank account,

362
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:04,203
they got ya!
Yes sir, the got ya.

363
00:22:05,769 --> 00:22:07,651
- Who's got him?
- The Heelots.

364
00:22:07,815 --> 00:22:08,806
Who?

365
00:22:09,138 --> 00:22:11,658
There's the City Hall tower
I'm supposed to jump off of.

366
00:22:11,825 --> 00:22:13,307
It's even higher than this.

367
00:22:13,469 --> 00:22:15,988
- Who's got him?
- The Heelots.

368
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:19,074
Wait a minute.

369
00:22:19,522 --> 00:22:21,165
That's not till Christmas Eve.

370
00:22:21,327 --> 00:22:23,129
Want to get me in a jam?

371
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:26,416
If it gets you in a jam,
I'll do you a favor. I won't jump.

372
00:22:28,024 --> 00:22:31,741
When they got ya, you got
no more chance than a road rabbit.

373
00:22:31,913 --> 00:22:33,509
Who was going to get him?

374
00:22:33,677 --> 00:22:36,037
Is this one of those places where
you ring if you want something?

375
00:22:36,203 --> 00:22:39,248
- Yeah, just use the phone.
- I always wanted to do that.

376
00:22:39,612 --> 00:22:41,287
Hey, Doc, look.

377
00:22:42,298 --> 00:22:45,536
Give me that again, will ya?
Who's gonna get him?

378
00:22:45,706 --> 00:22:47,144
The Heelots.

379
00:22:47,391 --> 00:22:48,507
Who are they?

380
00:22:48,913 --> 00:22:52,119
- Listen, you ever been broke?
- Mostly often.

381
00:22:52,282 --> 00:22:53,274
All right.

382
00:22:53,444 --> 00:22:57,208
You're walking along, not a nickel,
free as the wind, nobody bothers you.

383
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,530
Hundreds pass you by
in every line of business:

384
00:22:59,699 --> 00:23:02,780
shoes, hats, automobiles,
radios, furniture, everything.

385
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,787
They're all nice, loveable people
and they let you alone.

386
00:23:05,955 --> 00:23:07,186
Now, is that right?

387
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,194
Then you get hold of some dough,
and what happens?

388
00:23:11,287 --> 00:23:14,890
All those nice, sweet,
loveable people

389
00:23:15,377 --> 00:23:16,938
become Heelots. A lot of heels!

390
00:23:17,984 --> 00:23:21,428
The begin creepin' up on you.
Trying to sell you stuff.

391
00:23:21,953 --> 00:23:25,477
They get long claws and they
get a stranglehold on you.

392
00:23:25,642 --> 00:23:27,317
You squirm and you duck

393
00:23:27,487 --> 00:23:29,800
and you holler,
but you haven't got a chance.

394
00:23:29,972 --> 00:23:31,124
They got ya.

395
00:23:31,295 --> 00:23:34,979
First thing you know,
you own things. A car, for instance.

396
00:23:35,144 --> 00:23:37,985
Now your whole life is
messed up with more stuff:

397
00:23:38,152 --> 00:23:41,869
You got license fees
and number plates,

398
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,877
gas and oil, taxes and insurance,

399
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,566
and identification cards
and letters

400
00:23:46,732 --> 00:23:48,774
and bills
and flat tires and dents

401
00:23:48,938 --> 00:23:50,820
and traffic tickets
and motorcycle cops

402
00:23:50,983 --> 00:23:54,906
and courtrooms, lawyers, fines
and a million other things.

403
00:23:55,474 --> 00:23:56,829
And what happens?

404
00:23:58,121 --> 00:24:00,799
You're not the free and
happy guy you used to be.

405
00:24:00,967 --> 00:24:03,692
You got to have money
to pay for all those things.

406
00:24:03,854 --> 00:24:06,169
So you go after
what the other fella's got.

407
00:24:06,581 --> 00:24:09,625
And there you are.
You're a Heelot yourself.

408
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:20,524
You win, Colonel.
Take the fifty.

409
00:24:21,697 --> 00:24:24,697
- Go out and get rid of it.
- You bet. Fast as I can.

410
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:28,788
I'll get can goods, a fishing rod,
the rest I'll give away.

411
00:24:29,155 --> 00:24:30,385
Give away?

412
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,482
Get me a pitcher's glove.
I got to get some practice.

413
00:24:34,528 --> 00:24:37,047
Say, he's giving it away,
I'm gonna get me some.

414
00:24:37,213 --> 00:24:39,175
Come back here, you Heelot.

415
00:24:41,985 --> 00:24:45,030
Send up 5 hamburgers
with all the trimmings,

416
00:24:45,474 --> 00:24:47,595
5 ice cream sodas

417
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:49,755
and 5 pieces of apple pie.

418
00:24:50,687 --> 00:24:53,206
No, apple. With cheese.

419
00:24:53,694 --> 00:24:54,766
Yeah, thanks.

420
00:25:08,449 --> 00:25:09,727
Hello there.

421
00:25:11,897 --> 00:25:13,414
Well, well.

422
00:25:14,143 --> 00:25:16,537
If it isn't the man about town.

423
00:25:16,709 --> 00:25:17,667
All set, Miss Ann.

424
00:25:19,356 --> 00:25:21,715
Oh, yes. Let's go.

425
00:25:22,883 --> 00:25:24,959
Let's see. We want some
action in these pictures.

426
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,041
Action?

427
00:25:28,698 --> 00:25:29,689
Action!

428
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,096
No, no. This man's
going to jump off a roof.

429
00:25:32,266 --> 00:25:35,151
Wait a minute.
Let me comb your hair.

430
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:41,086
There, that's better.

431
00:25:48,825 --> 00:25:50,823
He's got a nice face, hasn't he?

432
00:25:50,992 --> 00:25:52,508
Yeah, he's pretty.

433
00:25:54,841 --> 00:25:56,996
Here, sit down.
Quiet, egghead.

434
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,763
Now a serious expression.

435
00:26:00,173 --> 00:26:02,853
- I can't. I'm feeling too good.
- Come on, this is serious.

436
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,666
You're a man disgusted
with all of civilization.

437
00:26:05,827 --> 00:26:08,587
- With all of it?
- Yes, you're sore at the world.

438
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:10,836
- Crabby guy, huh?
- Yeah.

439
00:26:13,766 --> 00:26:14,918
No, no!

440
00:26:16,814 --> 00:26:17,725
No.

441
00:26:20,823 --> 00:26:21,894
Look...

442
00:26:22,066 --> 00:26:24,301
you don't have to smell the world.

443
00:26:26,476 --> 00:26:28,791
- With those guys in the bleachers.
- Never mind those guys.

444
00:26:28,961 --> 00:26:30,193
Stand up.

445
00:26:30,366 --> 00:26:32,805
See what you look like protesting.

446
00:26:33,172 --> 00:26:36,013
- Against what?
- Against anything, just protest.

447
00:26:37,543 --> 00:26:38,820
You got me.

448
00:26:39,107 --> 00:26:40,589
Look, I'm the umpire.

449
00:26:40,751 --> 00:26:43,908
You cut the plate with
a fast one and I call it a ball.

450
00:26:44,238 --> 00:26:46,680
- Now what would you do?
- You did, huh?

451
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:49,521
Why can't you call it right?
You bone-headed, big-eared...

452
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:51,414
Grab it, Eddy. Grab it.

453
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:19,639
Extra! Extra!

454
00:27:23,734 --> 00:27:26,619
Read all about it!
Extra!

455
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,909
I don't care who's picture
they're publishing,

456
00:27:47,071 --> 00:27:50,114
I still say this
John Doe person is a myth.

457
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:51,714
You can quote me on that.

458
00:27:51,882 --> 00:27:55,245
I'm going to insist on his being
produced for questioning.

459
00:27:55,611 --> 00:27:58,336
You know as well as I do
that this whole thing

460
00:27:58,498 --> 00:28:00,972
is being engineered
by a vicious man

461
00:28:01,145 --> 00:28:02,660
with a vicious purpose.

462
00:28:02,828 --> 00:28:04,264
Mr. D.B. Norton.

463
00:28:27,608 --> 00:28:29,807
Mr. Connell and Miss Mitchell
are at the house, sir.

464
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:31,855
Oh, they are?
Come on.

465
00:28:34,143 --> 00:28:36,504
Personally, I think it's
stupidity to drop it now.

466
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:40,307
His fan mail is in the thousands.
It's going like a house afire.

467
00:28:40,478 --> 00:28:43,239
What are you afraid of, Connell?
It's doubled our circulation.

468
00:28:43,405 --> 00:28:45,081
But it's got everybody sore.

469
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,816
Ads are being pulled.
Governor's starting a libel suit.

470
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,577
They all know he's a phony
and insist on seeing him.

471
00:28:50,744 --> 00:28:53,629
Let them see him?
We'll let them hear him.

472
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,106
You own a radio station.
Why not put him on the air?

473
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:58,512
Watch out for this dame, D.B.,
she'll drive you batty.

474
00:28:58,682 --> 00:29:01,328
We can't let them start pumping
this bush league pitcher.

475
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,056
No telling what
that screwball might do.

476
00:29:04,215 --> 00:29:07,580
I walk in yesterday, he's on
a table with a fishing pole,

477
00:29:07,745 --> 00:29:08,976
fly-casting.

478
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:11,828
Get him out of town before
this thing explodes in our faces.

479
00:29:11,995 --> 00:29:14,799
You do and you're as much of
a dumb cluck as he is. Excuse me.

480
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:18,086
- You got yourself a meal ticket.
- Sure it is, I admit...

481
00:29:18,249 --> 00:29:21,854
but it's also a windfall for
Mr. Norton who wants into politics.

482
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:24,777
That's why you bought the paper,
to reach a lot of people?

483
00:29:24,945 --> 00:29:27,705
Put John Doe on the air
and you'll reach 130 million.

484
00:29:27,873 --> 00:29:30,028
He can say anything he wants.

485
00:29:30,198 --> 00:29:33,083
Forget the Governor and the Mayor
and all the small fry.

486
00:29:33,245 --> 00:29:35,127
This can arouse national interest.

487
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:38,095
If he made a hit here,
he can do it around the country.

488
00:29:38,258 --> 00:29:41,142
And you'll be
pulling the strings, Mr. Norton.

489
00:29:43,711 --> 00:29:45,946
Arrange for some radio time.

490
00:29:46,116 --> 00:29:48,397
- D.B...
- As soon as possible.

491
00:29:51,569 --> 00:29:54,374
Okay. I just came in
to get warm myself.

492
00:29:54,777 --> 00:29:56,099
Come on, let's go.

493
00:29:57,304 --> 00:29:59,138
Don't you go.
I want to talk to you.

494
00:30:05,483 --> 00:30:06,520
Sit down.

495
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:25,721
This John Doe idea
was yours, wasn't it?

496
00:30:26,894 --> 00:30:27,807
Yes, sir.

497
00:30:34,513 --> 00:30:36,748
- How much money do you get?
- 30 dollars.

498
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,842
30 dollars.

499
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:42,491
Well, what are you after? I mean...

500
00:30:42,653 --> 00:30:45,777
- You want a journalistic career?
- Money.

501
00:30:46,502 --> 00:30:49,900
Money. Well, I'm glad
to hear somebody admit it.

502
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:57,120
Could you write a radio speech
to put that fellow over?

503
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,214
- I'm sure I can.
- Do and I'll give you 100 a week.

504
00:31:00,415 --> 00:31:02,570
- 100 dollars.
- That's only the beginning.

505
00:31:02,941 --> 00:31:06,258
Play your cards right and you'll
never worry about money again.

506
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,393
I knew it.

507
00:31:08,555 --> 00:31:10,869
Whenever there's
a pretty woman around...

508
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:13,162
This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon.
Miss Mitchell.

509
00:31:13,326 --> 00:31:14,603
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

510
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:18,054
I'll give you a break, Casanova.
See Miss Mitchell gets a car home.

511
00:31:18,258 --> 00:31:20,218
Always reading my mind.

512
00:31:20,703 --> 00:31:22,620
Thank you for everything.

513
00:31:23,391 --> 00:31:24,826
And Miss Mitchell,

514
00:31:25,355 --> 00:31:27,795
from now on,
you better work directly from me.

515
00:31:28,362 --> 00:31:29,514
Yes, sir.

516
00:32:05,411 --> 00:32:08,172
- I thought you were asleep.
- We want to say goodnight.

517
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,700
You little brats,
you're just stalling.

518
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:15,471
Come, children.
It's past your bedtime.

519
00:32:15,796 --> 00:32:17,198
Oh, all right.

520
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:19,800
Come on, come on.

521
00:32:20,447 --> 00:32:22,568
If Scootch will
stay for me, I'm done.

522
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,329
I'll never get this speech right.

523
00:32:24,497 --> 00:32:26,857
Yes you will, Ann dear.
You're very clever.

524
00:32:27,023 --> 00:32:28,380
Yeah, I know.
What are you looking for?

525
00:32:29,469 --> 00:32:31,464
Your purse.
I need ten dollars.

526
00:32:31,634 --> 00:32:33,516
What for?
I gave you fifty the other day.

527
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,158
I know, but Mrs. Burke had
her baby yesterday. Nine pounds.

528
00:32:37,569 --> 00:32:39,324
There wasn't a thing in the house.

529
00:32:39,493 --> 00:32:41,216
Then,
the Community Chest lady came.

530
00:32:41,699 --> 00:32:43,614
And the 50 dollars is gone.
Who's the 10 for?

531
00:32:43,784 --> 00:32:45,186
- The Websters.
- The Websters.

532
00:32:45,348 --> 00:32:47,867
You remember those lovely people
your father used to take care of?

533
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:50,154
I thought I'd buy them groceries.

534
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:51,881
Ann, it's a shame those poor...

535
00:32:52,044 --> 00:32:54,769
You're marvelous,
just like father used to be.

536
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:58,009
You realize a couple of weeks ago
we didn't have enough to eat?

537
00:32:58,178 --> 00:33:01,941
But these people are in such need
and we have plenty now.

538
00:33:02,107 --> 00:33:04,708
If you mean the 1,000 dollars,
forget it. It's practically gone.

539
00:33:04,874 --> 00:33:06,357
We owed everybody in town.

540
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:08,717
You got to stop
giving all your money away.

541
00:33:08,884 --> 00:33:10,115
Oh, Ann dear.

542
00:33:10,287 --> 00:33:13,571
I'm sorry, Ma.
Don't pay any attention to me.

543
00:33:13,735 --> 00:33:15,972
I guess I'm just
all upset about all this.

544
00:33:16,301 --> 00:33:18,981
Here I am with a great
opportunity to get somewhere,

545
00:33:19,149 --> 00:33:21,715
to give you security for once,
and I'm stuck.

546
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:25,034
If I could put this over,
Mrs. Burke can have six babies.

547
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:29,172
- The speech you're writing?
- Yeah. I can't get it to gel.

548
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:31,728
I created somebody who's
giving up his life for a principle.

549
00:33:31,898 --> 00:33:34,545
Thousands of people are going to
listen to him over the radio,

550
00:33:34,705 --> 00:33:37,226
and unless he says
something sensational,

551
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:38,953
it's just no good.

552
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:42,754
I don't know what kind of
speech you're going to write,

553
00:33:42,925 --> 00:33:46,722
but from the samples I've read,
I don't think anybody will listen.

554
00:33:46,895 --> 00:33:47,966
What?

555
00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:51,623
There are so many
complaining, political speeches.

556
00:33:51,827 --> 00:33:55,431
People are tired of hearing
doom and despair on the radio.

557
00:33:55,637 --> 00:33:58,680
If you're going to have him
say anything,

558
00:33:58,843 --> 00:34:01,489
why not something simple
and real, with hope in it?

559
00:34:02,733 --> 00:34:05,573
Your father were alive, he'd know.

560
00:34:06,102 --> 00:34:07,173
Yeah.

561
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,140
Father certainly would.

562
00:34:10,552 --> 00:34:11,954
Wait a minute.

563
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:31,192
That's your father's diary, Ann.

564
00:34:31,362 --> 00:34:34,486
Father's...?
I never knew he had a diary.

565
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,771
Enough for 100 speeches.

566
00:34:36,935 --> 00:34:38,975
Things people ought to hear now.

567
00:34:39,501 --> 00:34:41,498
Be careful of it, won't you.

568
00:34:41,827 --> 00:34:44,062
It's always helped to keep
your father alive for me.

569
00:34:44,232 --> 00:34:46,149
You bet I will, Ma.

570
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,915
We wanna see him!

571
00:34:49,085 --> 00:34:52,004
Wait a minute, John Doe
don't want to sign autographs.

572
00:34:52,172 --> 00:34:55,091
- Well, what does he do all day?
- What does he do all day?

573
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,859
- He's writing out his memories.
- Please!

574
00:34:58,026 --> 00:35:01,071
Sorry, lady. You can't see Mr. Doe.
He wants to be alone.

575
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:04,871
No, he sits around all day
and commutes with himself.

576
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,139
Ball!

577
00:35:22,284 --> 00:35:25,089
I don't know how you'll
stand it here till after Christmas.

578
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,415
You ain't heard a train whistle
in two weeks.

579
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,364
Strike!

580
00:35:54,762 --> 00:35:56,405
I know why you're hanging around.

581
00:36:03,584 --> 00:36:05,339
You're stuck on the girl.

582
00:36:08,435 --> 00:36:11,276
All I guy needs is to get
hooked up with a woman.

583
00:36:28,523 --> 00:36:29,800
Was that a single?

584
00:36:30,768 --> 00:36:32,251
First baseman dropped the ball.

585
00:36:33,095 --> 00:36:34,531
Butterfingers!

586
00:36:34,898 --> 00:36:36,051
Tough luck, pal.

587
00:36:42,196 --> 00:36:44,032
Guy has a woman on his hands,

588
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:47,360
first thing he knows his life
is balled up with more things.

589
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,412
Furniture.

590
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,553
Did you get him?

591
00:37:03,007 --> 00:37:04,077
You're out!

592
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:07,570
- This the end of the 8th?
- The 9th.

593
00:37:12,348 --> 00:37:15,587
Beany, a couple of mugs from
the Chronicle are snooping around.

594
00:37:19,285 --> 00:37:20,927
Come on, Angel Face.

595
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:26,131
- What's the score, Angel Face?
- 3 to 2, our favor.

596
00:37:26,302 --> 00:37:27,705
Gee, that's great!

597
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:37,003
You got swell form.
Must have been a good pitcher.

598
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:40,409
Pretty good? I was about ready
for the majors when I chipped

599
00:37:40,577 --> 00:37:43,621
a bone in my elbow.
Got it pitching a 19 inning game.

600
00:37:43,784 --> 00:37:45,459
- 19?
- Yeah.

601
00:37:45,628 --> 00:37:47,785
A major league scout was watching.

602
00:37:47,955 --> 00:37:49,950
He came down after
with a contract.

603
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,804
You know what? I couldn't
lift my arm to sign it.

604
00:37:54,771 --> 00:37:57,656
- I'll be okay when I'm fixed up.
- Yeah, it's too bad.

605
00:37:58,861 --> 00:38:00,012
What do you mean 'too bad'?

606
00:38:01,266 --> 00:38:03,183
That you'll never play again.

607
00:38:03,832 --> 00:38:06,592
What are you talking about?
I just told you...

608
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,519
You know how they are in baseball
if a guy's mixed up in a racket.

609
00:38:10,007 --> 00:38:11,490
Racket? What do you mean?

610
00:38:12,011 --> 00:38:14,931
I was thinking about
this John Doe business.

611
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:17,621
As soon as it comes out
it's all a fake,

612
00:38:17,786 --> 00:38:20,225
you'll be washed up
in baseball, won't you?

613
00:38:22,317 --> 00:38:23,548
Yeah.

614
00:38:26,045 --> 00:38:28,407
Doggone.
I never thought about that.

615
00:38:34,265 --> 00:38:36,661
- Gosh!
- And what about the kids?

616
00:38:37,835 --> 00:38:39,956
The kids that
idolize ball players?

617
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,761
What will they think about ya?

618
00:38:42,927 --> 00:38:43,918
Yeah.

619
00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:45,722
Hey, Colonel.

620
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,097
Did you hear that?

621
00:38:50,424 --> 00:38:53,025
I got to figure
some way out of this thing.

622
00:38:53,232 --> 00:38:55,147
Elevators are still running.

623
00:38:56,318 --> 00:38:58,920
- I know one way you can do it.
- How?

624
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:01,683
When you get on the radio,

625
00:39:01,852 --> 00:39:04,166
all you have to do is say
the whole thing's a frame-up

626
00:39:04,338 --> 00:39:06,459
Make you a hero,
sure as you're born.

627
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:10,020
Yeah, but how am I
going to get my arm fixed?

628
00:39:10,193 --> 00:39:11,674
That's a cinch.

629
00:39:12,156 --> 00:39:14,313
I know somebody who'll
give you 5,000 dollars

630
00:39:14,523 --> 00:39:17,602
- to tell the truth on the radio.
- 5,000 dollars.

631
00:39:18,092 --> 00:39:20,657
Yeah, 5,000 dollars
and he gets it right away.

632
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,659
Don't have to wait till Christmas.

633
00:39:23,424 --> 00:39:26,422
Look out, Long John,
they're closing in on you.

634
00:39:27,754 --> 00:39:29,714
Say, who's putting up this dough?

635
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,882
Fella runs the Chronicle.

636
00:39:33,969 --> 00:39:36,774
Here's the speech you make
all written for you.

637
00:39:38,381 --> 00:39:40,501
5,000 dollars.

638
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:43,585
Holy mackerel!
I can see the Heelots coming.

639
00:39:43,754 --> 00:39:44,904
The whole army of them.

640
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,511
It's on the level.

641
00:39:59,955 --> 00:40:02,715
No, I'm sorry, tickets for
the broadcast are all gone.

642
00:40:03,002 --> 00:40:04,280
Phone the Bulletin.

643
00:40:04,447 --> 00:40:06,249
Sorry, no more tickets left.

644
00:40:17,843 --> 00:40:20,489
All set for the big night?
Swell!

645
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,691
- Turn around. Now stand still.
- Hold it, Mr. Doe.

646
00:40:23,578 --> 00:40:25,221
Big smile, Mr. Doe.

647
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:28,666
- Okay, Beany, that's enough.
- Alright, scram now.

648
00:40:29,434 --> 00:40:31,908
John, here's the speech.
It's in caps and double spaced.

649
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,517
You'll have no trouble reading it.

650
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:36,205
Not nervous, are you?
Of course not, he wouldn't be.

651
00:40:36,372 --> 00:40:38,413
- Who?
- John Doe. The one in there.

652
00:40:38,578 --> 00:40:40,733
Don't let your knees rattle.
It picks up on the mike.

653
00:40:40,904 --> 00:40:44,429
You needn't be nervous.
Remember to be sincere.

654
00:40:44,594 --> 00:40:46,750
- It's for you, Miss Mitchell.
- Okay.

655
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,315
Hello? Yes, mother.
Thank you, darling.

656
00:40:49,808 --> 00:40:53,412
There he is, the poor dear man.

657
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:56,943
Good luck to you, Mr. Doe.
We are all for you.

658
00:40:57,108 --> 00:40:59,068
The girls all decided

659
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:02,392
that you're not to jump off
any roof at all.

660
00:41:03,885 --> 00:41:06,201
- Got the speech I gave ya?
- Yeah.

661
00:41:07,455 --> 00:41:09,576
I'll give the money to the Colonel

662
00:41:09,741 --> 00:41:11,702
as soon as you get started.

663
00:41:11,746 --> 00:41:13,982
We'll have a car waiting
at the side entrance for you.

664
00:41:14,153 --> 00:41:15,750
How'd you get in here?

665
00:41:15,917 --> 00:41:18,803
- Just came to wish him luck.
- Come on, out! Out!

666
00:41:19,326 --> 00:41:21,323
Mother says 'good luck', too.

667
00:41:21,493 --> 00:41:24,492
John, when you read the speech,
please believe every word.

668
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,657
He turned out to be wonderful.

669
00:41:26,827 --> 00:41:29,222
- Who?
- John Doe, the one in the speech.

670
00:41:29,513 --> 00:41:32,959
Know something? I've actually
fallen in love with him.

671
00:41:33,805 --> 00:41:35,767
All right, there he is, sister.
Plenty of bulk.

672
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:38,211
- What's the idea?
- No, that's too much.

673
00:41:38,377 --> 00:41:40,979
No, not so much. Now come on.

674
00:41:41,145 --> 00:41:43,665
This is no time for
cheap publicity, Mr. Connell.

675
00:41:43,832 --> 00:41:46,558
If that guy lays an egg,
I want something out of it.

676
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,043
I'm getting a Jane Doe ready.

677
00:41:48,324 --> 00:41:51,564
Come on, will you fellas?
Give me a chance.

678
00:41:51,734 --> 00:41:54,254
Just one more, please?

679
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,413
Fine honey, you go ahead.

680
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:56,575
How you doing?

681
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:58,183
Alright Beany, bring them in.

682
00:41:58,591 --> 00:42:00,987
Holy smoke! Half a Heelot.

683
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,526
There you are, boss.
Symbols of little people.

684
00:42:04,687 --> 00:42:06,330
- Okay, get 'em up.
- Alright little fella.

685
00:42:06,493 --> 00:42:10,383
This is ridiculous, Mr. Connell.
He's on the air in a few minutes.

686
00:42:10,785 --> 00:42:13,829
You'll get all your pictures after.

687
00:42:14,273 --> 00:42:15,551
Come on, Ed.

688
00:42:16,399 --> 00:42:17,916
Come on. That's right.

689
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:20,124
- Pictures afterwards.
- Thank you very much.

690
00:42:21,854 --> 00:42:23,530
Come on, Snooks.
You better bail out.

691
00:42:23,859 --> 00:42:25,502
Goodbye, Mr. Doe.

692
00:42:26,065 --> 00:42:28,187
- Beany!
- Alright, alright.

693
00:42:30,396 --> 00:42:32,198
Get ready. One minute to go.

694
00:42:32,362 --> 00:42:34,197
And the score's nothing to nothing.

695
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,492
Now please, John.
You won't let me down, will ya?

696
00:42:38,899 --> 00:42:39,936
Will ya?

697
00:42:41,066 --> 00:42:42,263
Of course you won't.

698
00:42:42,428 --> 00:42:45,348
If you just think of yourself
as the real John Doe...

699
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:49,682
Everything in that speech
are things a man believed in.

700
00:42:49,848 --> 00:42:51,605
It was my father, John.

701
00:42:52,095 --> 00:42:54,331
And when he talked,
people listened.

702
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,417
And they'll listen to you, too.

703
00:42:57,148 --> 00:42:58,139
Funny...

704
00:42:58,992 --> 00:43:01,069
you know what my mother said?

705
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,198
She said to look into your eyes,
that I'd see my father there.

706
00:43:08,017 --> 00:43:10,252
- What do you say?
- Okay, we're coming.

707
00:43:11,466 --> 00:43:15,104
Listen, John. You're a pitcher.
Get in there and pitch.

708
00:43:17,001 --> 00:43:18,232
Good luck.

709
00:43:18,926 --> 00:43:20,077
Let him through.

710
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:37,333
Let's get out of here.
The door's right there.

711
00:43:37,496 --> 00:43:39,936
- What are you doing here?
- That's what I'd like to know.

712
00:43:40,102 --> 00:43:41,506
- Come on, out!
- He's a friend of mine.

713
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:43,708
Never mind. Let him alone.

714
00:43:46,118 --> 00:43:48,116
I'll be over there pulling for you.

715
00:43:51,012 --> 00:43:52,734
No, John, over here.

716
00:43:57,991 --> 00:43:58,902
Stand by.

717
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:34,044
Phone the Chronicle.
Tell 'em to get the Extras out.

718
00:44:55,881 --> 00:44:59,485
Good evening, Kenneth Fry
speaking for the New Bulletin.

719
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:02,455
Tonight we give you something
entirely new and different.

720
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:05,502
Beside me is the young man
who has declared publicly that

721
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:08,505
on Christmas Eve he will suicide,

722
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:10,988
giving as his reason,
quote:

723
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:13,163
"I protest against
the state of civilization."

724
00:45:13,164 --> 00:45:14,315
End quote.

725
00:45:14,487 --> 00:45:17,327
Ladies and gentlemen,
the New Bulletin presents

726
00:45:17,494 --> 00:45:20,095
the man who is fast becoming
the most talked about person

727
00:45:20,262 --> 00:45:22,827
in the country, John Doe.

728
00:45:45,764 --> 00:45:47,121
Ladies and gentlemen...

729
00:45:50,255 --> 00:45:53,494
I am the man you all know
as John Doe.

730
00:45:54,466 --> 00:45:57,670
I took that name because
it seems to describe...

731
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,003
because it seems to describe

732
00:46:02,164 --> 00:46:05,209
the average man,
and that's me.

733
00:46:05,694 --> 00:46:07,016
And that's me.

734
00:46:11,107 --> 00:46:14,665
Well, it was me before I said
I was going to jump off

735
00:46:14,836 --> 00:46:17,151
the City Hall roof on Christmas Eve.

736
00:46:18,245 --> 00:46:20,559
I guess I'm not average anymore.

737
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:24,818
Now I'm getting all sorts
of attention, from big shots too.

738
00:46:24,981 --> 00:46:26,303
We've been double crossed.

739
00:46:26,465 --> 00:46:28,506
The Mayor and Governor,
for instance, they don't like

740
00:46:28,871 --> 00:46:32,634
- ...those articles I wrote.
- You're an impostor, young fella!

741
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,557
It's a pack of lies you're telling!

742
00:46:36,009 --> 00:46:37,240
Who wrote that speech for you?

743
00:46:39,938 --> 00:46:40,896
Beany, get that guy!

744
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:49,031
...publicity stunt for the Bulletin.

745
00:46:51,287 --> 00:46:52,243
Spencer.

746
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:54,530
Ladies and gentlemen,
the disturbance you just heard

747
00:46:54,694 --> 00:46:57,854
was caused by someone in
the audience heckling Mr. Doe.

748
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,824
The speech will continue.

749
00:47:04,479 --> 00:47:07,763
Well, people like the Governor...

750
00:47:08,368 --> 00:47:11,733
people like the Governor
and that fella can stop worrying.

751
00:47:12,379 --> 00:47:15,936
I'm not gonna talk about them.
I'm gonna talk about us,

752
00:47:16,669 --> 00:47:19,109
the average man, the John Does.

753
00:47:19,757 --> 00:47:22,915
If anybody ever asked you
what the average John Doe is like,

754
00:47:23,325 --> 00:47:26,609
you couldn't tell him because
he's a million and one things.

755
00:47:27,455 --> 00:47:29,771
He's Mr. Big
and Mr. Small.

756
00:47:29,942 --> 00:47:33,306
He's simple and he's wise.
He's inherently honest,

757
00:47:33,471 --> 00:47:35,431
but he's got a streak of
larceny in his heart.

758
00:47:35,636 --> 00:47:38,316
He seldom walks up to a public
telephone without shoving

759
00:47:38,603 --> 00:47:41,329
his finger in the slot to see
if somebody left a nickel.

760
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:55,839
He's the man the ads
are written for,

761
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:58,526
the fella everybody
sells things to.

762
00:47:58,974 --> 00:48:02,132
He's Joe Dokes,
the world's greatest stooge,

763
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:04,378
and the world's greatest strength.

764
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:14,852
Yes, sir...

765
00:48:15,895 --> 00:48:18,622
Yes, sir, we're a great family,
the John Does.

766
00:48:18,863 --> 00:48:22,581
We're the meek who are...
supposed to inherit the earth.

767
00:48:23,715 --> 00:48:27,159
You'll find us everywhere.
We raise the crops, dig the mines,

768
00:48:27,324 --> 00:48:30,403
work the factories,
keep the books, fly the planes,

769
00:48:30,572 --> 00:48:33,937
and drive the buses.
When a cop yells "Stand back, you",

770
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,381
he means us, the John Does.

771
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,942
What kind of a speech is that?
Didn't you read it?

772
00:48:39,193 --> 00:48:42,558
We've existed since time began.
We built the Pyramids,

773
00:48:42,882 --> 00:48:44,923
we saw Christ crucified,

774
00:48:45,128 --> 00:48:47,203
pulled the oars
for Roman emperors,

775
00:48:47,373 --> 00:48:49,096
sailed the boats for Columbus,

776
00:48:49,779 --> 00:48:52,219
retreated from Moscow with Napoleon,

777
00:48:52,386 --> 00:48:54,986
and froze with Washington
at Valley Forge.

778
00:48:57,759 --> 00:48:58,751
Yes, sir,

779
00:48:58,922 --> 00:49:01,316
we've been in there
dodging left hooks

780
00:49:01,488 --> 00:49:03,724
since before History
began to walk.

781
00:49:04,095 --> 00:49:07,061
In our struggle for freedom
we've hit the canvas many a time,

782
00:49:07,222 --> 00:49:10,940
but we always bounce back because
we're the people and we're tough.

783
00:49:16,044 --> 00:49:18,724
They've started a lot of talk
about free people going soft,

784
00:49:18,891 --> 00:49:21,857
that we can't take it.
That's a lot of hooey!

785
00:49:23,022 --> 00:49:26,226
Free people can beat the world
at anything from war

786
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:29,069
to tiddlywinks if we all
pull in the same direction.

787
00:49:36,856 --> 00:49:39,935
I know a lot of you are saying:
What can I do?

788
00:49:40,104 --> 00:49:42,749
I'm just a little punk.
I don't count.

789
00:49:43,111 --> 00:49:45,472
You're dead wrong.
Little punks have always counted

790
00:49:45,637 --> 00:49:48,204
because in the long run
the character of a country

791
00:49:48,364 --> 00:49:51,330
is the sum total of
the character of it's little punks.

792
00:49:58,469 --> 00:50:00,750
But we've all got to
get in there and pitch.

793
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:03,960
We can't win the old ball game
unless we have team work,

794
00:50:04,124 --> 00:50:06,928
and that's where
every John Doe comes in.

795
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:10,015
It's up to him to
get together with his team mate,

796
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:12,979
and your team mate, my friends,

797
00:50:13,146 --> 00:50:14,868
is the guy next door to you.

798
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:18,999
Your neighbor, he's a
terribly important guy.

799
00:50:19,521 --> 00:50:21,518
You and he need each other,

800
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:24,572
so call him up.
If he's sick, call on him.

801
00:50:24,734 --> 00:50:26,536
If he's hungry, feed him.

802
00:50:26,699 --> 00:50:29,014
If he's out of a job,
find him one.

803
00:50:29,866 --> 00:50:31,828
To most of you,
your neighbor is a stranger.

804
00:50:31,992 --> 00:50:34,798
A guy with a barking dog
and a high fence around him.

805
00:50:34,959 --> 00:50:38,484
You can't be a stranger to
a guy that's on your own team.

806
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,415
So tear down the fence
that separates you.

807
00:50:41,656 --> 00:50:45,659
Tear it down and you'll tear down
a lot of hates and prejudices.

808
00:50:45,947 --> 00:50:47,623
Tear down all the fences

809
00:50:47,791 --> 00:50:50,072
and you'll really have teamwork.

810
00:50:58,137 --> 00:51:00,577
I know a lot of you
are saying to yourselves:

811
00:51:00,743 --> 00:51:02,466
"He's asking for a miracle.

812
00:51:02,628 --> 00:51:05,354
He's expecting people
to change all of a sudden."

813
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:06,667
Well, you're wrong.

814
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:08,754
It's no miracle.
It's no miracle...

815
00:51:08,923 --> 00:51:12,687
because I see it happen
once a year and so do you,

816
00:51:13,094 --> 00:51:14,610
at Christmas time.

817
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,344
There's something swell
about the spirit of Christmas.

818
00:51:18,507 --> 00:51:21,392
To see what it does to people,
all kinds of people.

819
00:51:22,116 --> 00:51:25,001
Now why can't that spirit,

820
00:51:25,164 --> 00:51:28,049
that same warm Christmas spirit,
last the whole year round?

821
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:29,523
Gosh!

822
00:51:30,216 --> 00:51:33,980
If it ever did,
if each and every John Doe

823
00:51:34,146 --> 00:51:37,271
made that spirit last 365 days,

824
00:51:37,434 --> 00:51:39,110
we'd develop such a strength,

825
00:51:39,279 --> 00:51:42,358
we'd create such a tidal wave
of goodwill that no human force

826
00:51:42,527 --> 00:51:43,644
could stand against it.

827
00:51:45,494 --> 00:51:46,896
Yes sir, my friends,

828
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,860
the meek can only inherit the earth

829
00:51:51,027 --> 00:51:53,308
when the John Does
start loving their neighbors.

830
00:51:54,156 --> 00:51:55,991
You better start right now.

831
00:51:56,521 --> 00:51:59,521
Don't wait till the game
is called on account of darkness.

832
00:52:01,092 --> 00:52:03,773
Wake up, John Doe,
you're the hope of the world.

833
00:52:12,641 --> 00:52:14,078
John, you were wonderful.

834
00:52:15,608 --> 00:52:17,170
Bravo! Bravo!

835
00:52:22,225 --> 00:52:24,221
- Let's get out of here.
- Now you're talking.

836
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:33,845
Gangway, you Heelots!

837
00:52:43,438 --> 00:52:45,637
I knew you'd wake up
sooner or later.

838
00:52:46,365 --> 00:52:48,725
Boy, am I glad
we got out of that mess.

839
00:52:49,372 --> 00:52:53,135
I had the 5,000 all sewed up.
Could've gone to Doc Brown.

840
00:52:55,748 --> 00:52:58,473
"You're a pitcher.", she says.
"Go in and pitch."

841
00:52:58,635 --> 00:53:00,311
What a sucker!

842
00:53:00,479 --> 00:53:03,559
She's a Heelot just like the rest.
Lucky you got away from her.

843
00:53:03,728 --> 00:53:06,647
What was I doing making
a speech, anyway? Me?

844
00:53:07,056 --> 00:53:10,419
- The more I think about it...!
- Tear town all the fences.

845
00:53:10,584 --> 00:53:13,629
If you tore one picket off your
neighbor's fence, he'd sue you.

846
00:53:13,993 --> 00:53:16,228
5,000 bucks,
had it right in my hand.

847
00:53:16,759 --> 00:53:18,436
What do you mean
"he ran away"?

848
00:53:18,604 --> 00:53:20,965
Find him.
That man is terrific.

849
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:31,265
Columbia River, here we come!

850
00:54:18,712 --> 00:54:20,548
- Jitterbugs.
- Yeah.

851
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:25,158
- How much money we got left?
- Four bits.

852
00:54:25,329 --> 00:54:27,245
- Better make it doughnuts, huh?
- Yeah.

853
00:54:39,765 --> 00:54:41,167
What'll it be, gents?

854
00:54:41,369 --> 00:54:44,014
Have you got a couple of steaks
about that big and that thick?

855
00:54:44,216 --> 00:54:48,219
Yeah, with hash brown potatoes
and tomatoes and apple pie...

856
00:54:48,386 --> 00:54:51,306
- and ice cream and coffee?
- And doughnuts, I know.

857
00:54:51,474 --> 00:54:54,040
Hey, Ma! Sinkers, a pair.

858
00:54:54,441 --> 00:54:56,083
Sinkers, a pair. Comin' up.

859
00:54:56,246 --> 00:54:58,047
Glad he took the 't' out of that.

860
00:55:03,183 --> 00:55:04,539
Look at that.

861
00:55:05,629 --> 00:55:07,910
Join the John Doe Club.

862
00:55:09,197 --> 00:55:10,839
John Doe Club?

863
00:55:20,185 --> 00:55:21,176
Are you John Doe?

864
00:55:21,348 --> 00:55:22,990
- Who?
- John Doe.

865
00:55:23,152 --> 00:55:24,714
You need glasses, buddy.

866
00:55:24,877 --> 00:55:26,918
It's the spitting image
of John Doe.

867
00:55:27,082 --> 00:55:28,404
Yeah, but his name's Willoughby.

868
00:55:28,566 --> 00:55:30,846
I'm John Willoughby.
I'm a baseball player.

869
00:55:31,012 --> 00:55:34,296
No, I'd know that voice anywhere.
You can't kid me.

870
00:55:34,701 --> 00:55:36,137
You're John Doe.

871
00:55:36,345 --> 00:55:37,336
Ma!

872
00:55:37,588 --> 00:55:39,709
Ma!
That's John Doe!

873
00:55:39,873 --> 00:55:42,474
- John Doe!
- Sitting right there, big as life.

874
00:55:42,641 --> 00:55:45,481
- Who'd you say it was?
- John Doe. The big guy there.

875
00:55:47,773 --> 00:55:49,256
That's John Doe.

876
00:55:49,658 --> 00:55:51,175
It's John Doe!

877
00:55:51,783 --> 00:55:53,505
John Doe!

878
00:55:55,993 --> 00:55:57,750
John Doe!

879
00:55:58,279 --> 00:56:02,077
Operator, Dan Beaver.
Call everybody in town.

880
00:56:02,249 --> 00:56:05,773
John Doe was just in my place.
Yeah, he ordered doughnuts.

881
00:56:19,692 --> 00:56:21,813
You're all here to see John Doe
and you're all neighbors,

882
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:23,974
but my office is packed
like a sardine box.

883
00:56:24,143 --> 00:56:25,945
What does John Doe
look like, Mr. Mayor?

884
00:56:26,108 --> 00:56:28,423
He's one of those
great, big, outdoor type men.

885
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:31,674
You can't see him, you didn't
vote for me. What are you doing?

886
00:56:31,842 --> 00:56:34,282
Get off my front porch.
Mr. Norton come yet?

887
00:56:34,729 --> 00:56:37,728
What's keeping him?
Should've been here 15 minutes ago.

888
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,095
There he comes now.

889
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:44,181
Everybody on your dignity.

890
00:56:44,353 --> 00:56:46,508
Don't disgrace our little town.
We gotta show off.

891
00:56:49,766 --> 00:56:50,997
Better let me talk to him.

892
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:53,771
Present it to him as
a great cause for the common man.

893
00:56:53,936 --> 00:56:56,376
Here he comes.
Give him room, folks.

894
00:56:57,786 --> 00:57:00,786
Here they come.
Here's Mr. Norton.

895
00:57:01,235 --> 00:57:03,709
How do you do, Mr. Norton?
I'm the Mayor.

896
00:57:04,082 --> 00:57:05,279
The crowd back there!

897
00:57:05,445 --> 00:57:08,171
Let me to, you darn fool.
I'm the Mayor.

898
00:57:08,974 --> 00:57:12,419
I'm Mayor Hawkins!
Your office phoned me to hold him.

899
00:57:12,583 --> 00:57:15,229
- That's fine. How is he?
- He's fine. He's in my office.

900
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:17,671
It's a big honor having
John Doe here, and you too.

901
00:57:17,836 --> 00:57:20,071
Haven't had so much excitement
since the old City Hall burnt down.

902
00:57:20,242 --> 00:57:23,161
People so excited,
they nearly tore his clothes off.

903
00:57:23,329 --> 00:57:25,803
Matilda, phone the newspapers.
Tell them Mr. Norton's here.

904
00:57:25,976 --> 00:57:27,778
Step inside my office, Mr. Norton.

905
00:57:27,941 --> 00:57:30,222
It should be comfortable.
I just had it air-conditioned.

906
00:57:30,387 --> 00:57:33,033
Make room for Mr. Norton.

907
00:57:33,594 --> 00:57:34,917
Gangway, gangway.

908
00:57:35,079 --> 00:57:37,553
The neighbors are
serving him a light lunch.

909
00:57:37,925 --> 00:57:38,917
Hello, John.

910
00:57:41,254 --> 00:57:42,291
Hello.

911
00:57:43,178 --> 00:57:45,494
Mr. Mayor, if you don't mind,
we'd like to talk to him alone.

912
00:57:45,664 --> 00:57:47,547
Certainly.
Everybody clear out!

913
00:57:47,709 --> 00:57:50,105
Everybody, quickly now.
Come on.

914
00:57:52,963 --> 00:57:54,479
Come on.

915
00:57:54,647 --> 00:57:56,882
That's right. Come on.

916
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:00,860
Don't argue with me here.
Wait till we get home.

917
00:58:01,022 --> 00:58:04,261
You can't push me around,
even though I am your wife!

918
00:58:04,431 --> 00:58:07,316
Mr. Norton, you got a nerve
having these people hold us here.

919
00:58:09,243 --> 00:58:11,604
Nobody's holding you here.

920
00:58:12,291 --> 00:58:14,730
- It's only natural you...
- In that case, let's get going.

921
00:58:15,178 --> 00:58:17,458
Incidentally, my name isn't Doe.
It's Willoughby.

922
00:58:17,624 --> 00:58:19,984
Look, John.
Something important's happened.

923
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:23,309
They're forming John Doe Clubs.
We know of 8 and they say...

924
00:58:23,478 --> 00:58:25,120
John Doe Clubs? What for?

925
00:58:25,283 --> 00:58:27,324
To carry out the principles
in your radio speech.

926
00:58:27,649 --> 00:58:31,172
I don't care, I'm on my way
and I don't like being stopped.

927
00:58:31,338 --> 00:58:33,173
You don't how big this is.

928
00:58:33,342 --> 00:58:37,106
You should see the thousands
of telegrams about you.

929
00:58:37,273 --> 00:58:40,032
Look, it started as
a circulation stunt, didn't it?

930
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,766
You got your circulation.
Why don't you let me alone?

931
00:58:42,926 --> 00:58:45,366
It started as a circulation stunt
but it isn't anymore.

932
00:58:45,533 --> 00:58:48,772
Mr. Norton wants to back it,
sponsor clubs all over the country.

933
00:58:48,941 --> 00:58:51,507
He wants to send you
on a lecture tour.

934
00:58:51,748 --> 00:58:52,786
Me?

935
00:58:52,951 --> 00:58:55,551
Certainly. With you ability
to influence people,

936
00:58:55,718 --> 00:58:57,954
it might grow into
a glorious movement.

937
00:58:58,124 --> 00:59:00,040
Let's get something straight.

938
00:59:01,131 --> 00:59:02,168
I don't want any part of this.

939
00:59:02,334 --> 00:59:06,018
If you think I'm
lecturing people, you're crazy.

940
00:59:06,304 --> 00:59:08,665
Baseball's my racket
and I'm sticking to it.

941
00:59:09,352 --> 00:59:11,234
Colonel, let's get out of here.

942
00:59:11,397 --> 00:59:12,309
John.

943
00:59:12,479 --> 00:59:14,840
Please, I just
got rid of one crowd.

944
00:59:15,005 --> 00:59:17,890
Please, Mr. Mayor,
tell him the John Doe Club

945
00:59:18,053 --> 00:59:19,535
wants to talk to him.

946
00:59:19,697 --> 00:59:21,259
Let them in, Mr. Mayor.

947
00:59:21,622 --> 00:59:24,427
Okay, but remember your manners.
No stampeding.

948
00:59:24,589 --> 00:59:27,589
Walk slow, like you do when
you come to pay your taxes.

949
00:59:35,216 --> 00:59:36,572
All right.
Give me a chance.

950
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:37,811
Come right in.

951
00:59:40,348 --> 00:59:42,549
My name's Bert Hansen, Mr. Doe.

952
00:59:42,714 --> 00:59:45,234
I'm head soda-jerker
at Schwabacher's drugstore.

953
00:59:45,963 --> 00:59:47,159
Well, sir...

954
00:59:47,325 --> 00:59:49,892
me and my wife,
we heard your broadcast

955
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:53,018
and we got quite a bang out of it.
Especially my wife.

956
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:55,985
Kept me up half the night saying:
"That man's right, honey.

957
00:59:56,147 --> 00:59:59,306
Trouble is, nobody gives a hoot
about his neighbor.

958
00:59:59,476 --> 01:00:02,235
That's why everybody in town is
sore and cranky with each other."

959
01:00:02,443 --> 01:00:05,283
I said: "That's fine,
but how's a guy

960
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:07,811
gonna go around lovin'
the kind of neighbors we got?"

961
01:00:07,976 --> 01:00:09,618
Old Sourpuss, for instance.

962
01:00:10,422 --> 01:00:14,220
Sourpuss Smithers is a guy,
lives alone next door to us.

963
01:00:14,393 --> 01:00:17,312
He's a cranky old man who runs
the second hand furniture store.

964
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,761
We haven't
spoken to him for years.

965
01:00:20,167 --> 01:00:23,690
I figured he was an ornery
old gent who hated the world

966
01:00:23,856 --> 01:00:26,696
'cause was always slamming
his garage door

967
01:00:26,864 --> 01:00:30,148
and played his radio so loud
it kept half the neighbors up.

968
01:00:31,635 --> 01:00:35,034
Anyway, the next morning
I'm out watering the lawn

969
01:00:35,204 --> 01:00:36,481
and there's old Sourpuss,

970
01:00:36,647 --> 01:00:39,374
straightening out
a dent in his fender.

971
01:00:40,177 --> 01:00:43,096
My wife yells to me
out the window:

972
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:45,419
"Go on, speak to him, Bert."

973
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:49,473
I figured I can't lose anything,
so I yelled over to him:

974
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:53,562
"Good morning, Mr. Smithers."
He went on pounding his fender.

975
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:57,287
Was I burned! I turned round
to my wife and she said:

976
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:00,707
"Louder, he didn't hear you."

977
01:01:01,229 --> 01:01:03,794
So in a voice you could've
heard in the next county I said:

978
01:01:03,955 --> 01:01:05,712
"Good morning, Mr. Smithers!"

979
01:01:07,925 --> 01:01:10,730
Well, you could have
knocked me over with a feather.

980
01:01:10,892 --> 01:01:13,972
Old Sourpuss turned around,
surprised like,

981
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:15,496
put on a big smile,

982
01:01:15,824 --> 01:01:19,382
came over, took my hand
like an old lodge brother and said:

983
01:01:19,553 --> 01:01:21,195
"Good morning, Hansen,

984
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:25,042
I've been wanting to talk for years
only I thought you didn't like me."

985
01:01:25,208 --> 01:01:27,887
Then he started chatting away
like a happy little kid.

986
01:01:28,055 --> 01:01:29,970
Got so excited his eyes...

987
01:01:30,541 --> 01:01:34,179
Well, before we got through
I found out that Smithers

988
01:01:34,351 --> 01:01:37,988
is a swell egg only he's pretty
deaf which accounts for the noises.

989
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:41,478
He says it's a shame how little
we know about our neighbors.

990
01:01:41,648 --> 01:01:43,770
Then he got an idea.
He say: "How's about...

991
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:45,895
inviting everybody some place
where we can all

992
01:01:46,059 --> 01:01:48,865
get together and
know each other a little better.

993
01:01:49,548 --> 01:01:51,224
I feel so good, I'm up for it.

994
01:01:51,392 --> 01:01:54,198
So Smithers goes
around the neighborhood

995
01:01:54,359 --> 01:01:56,675
inviting everybody
to a meeting at the schoolhouse.

996
01:01:56,846 --> 01:01:58,807
And I tell everybody
that comes into the store,

997
01:01:58,971 --> 01:02:01,172
including my boss.

998
01:02:01,537 --> 01:02:03,898
- I'm talking too much.
- No, you're not.

999
01:02:04,505 --> 01:02:05,736
Come on.

1000
01:02:06,429 --> 01:02:09,269
Well I'll be doggone if
forty people don't show up.

1001
01:02:09,437 --> 01:02:11,798
Course, none of us
knew what to do,

1002
01:02:11,963 --> 01:02:14,608
but we got a kick out of
how glad everybody was

1003
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:16,606
just to say hello to one another.

1004
01:02:17,176 --> 01:02:19,012
Tell him about making
Sourpuss chairman, honey.

1005
01:02:19,181 --> 01:02:21,462
Oh yeah, we made
Sourpuss chairman

1006
01:02:21,627 --> 01:02:23,668
and decided to call ourselves
the John Doe Club.

1007
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:26,592
Incidentally, this is my wife.
Come here, honey.

1008
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,963
This is my wife, Mr. Doe.

1009
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:30,562
How do you do, Mr. Doe?

1010
01:02:30,729 --> 01:02:33,570
- Sourpuss is here, too.
- Oh, is he?

1011
01:02:35,862 --> 01:02:39,261
This is Sourpuss. Excuse me.
Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.

1012
01:02:39,431 --> 01:02:42,157
If you didn't call me Sourpuss,
it wouldn't feel natural.

1013
01:02:44,284 --> 01:02:45,274
Well, I guess...

1014
01:02:45,446 --> 01:02:48,891
everybody in the neighborhood
came except the Delaneys.

1015
01:02:49,055 --> 01:02:52,579
They live in a big house
with an iron fence around it

1016
01:02:52,744 --> 01:02:54,865
and they always keep
their blinds drawn.

1017
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:58,873
We figured he was
an old miser that sat back

1018
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,926
counting his money,
so why bother inviting him?

1019
01:03:02,088 --> 01:03:04,368
Until Grimes the milkman said:

1020
01:03:04,534 --> 01:03:06,368
"You got the Delaneys all wrong."

1021
01:03:08,704 --> 01:03:12,022
Then he tells us they
cancelled their milk last week,

1022
01:03:12,192 --> 01:03:14,393
and he found
a note on the bottle,

1023
01:03:14,558 --> 01:03:17,523
got curious
and peeked under the blinds

1024
01:03:17,686 --> 01:03:19,362
and found the house was empty.

1025
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:22,004
"If you ask me", he says,
" they're starving."

1026
01:03:22,177 --> 01:03:25,734
Old man Delaney's been bringing
his furniture to me at night,

1027
01:03:25,906 --> 01:03:27,867
one piece at a time and selling it.

1028
01:03:29,194 --> 01:03:31,714
A half a dozen of us
went over there to fetch him

1029
01:03:31,881 --> 01:03:33,443
and we brought him to the meeting.

1030
01:03:33,765 --> 01:03:37,084
Everybody shook hands
and made a fuss over them.

1031
01:03:37,255 --> 01:03:38,771
Well, finally...

1032
01:03:39,179 --> 01:03:41,984
Mr. and Mrs. Delaney
sat right down and cried.

1033
01:03:42,427 --> 01:03:44,582
Then we started to find out
about a lot of other people.

1034
01:03:44,753 --> 01:03:47,992
- Sure, Grubbel, for instance.
- Grubbel's here.

1035
01:03:48,201 --> 01:03:49,877
- See?
- Yeah, that's him.

1036
01:03:50,848 --> 01:03:53,209
Of course,
you don't know Grubbel, but...

1037
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:55,849
he's the man everybody figured

1038
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:58,621
was the worst no-account
in the neighborhood

1039
01:03:58,827 --> 01:04:00,584
because he lived like a hermit.

1040
01:04:00,752 --> 01:04:02,668
Nobody had anything to do with him

1041
01:04:02,838 --> 01:04:05,882
until Murphy the postman
told us the truth.

1042
01:04:06,045 --> 01:04:09,284
Grubbel, he says,
lives out of garbage cans

1043
01:04:09,454 --> 01:04:13,457
because he won't take charity.
It'd ruin his self respect.

1044
01:04:13,824 --> 01:04:16,186
Just like you said
on the radio, Mr. Doe.

1045
01:04:16,711 --> 01:04:19,357
A dozen families got together
and gave Grubbel a job

1046
01:04:19,518 --> 01:04:21,480
watering their lawns.

1047
01:04:21,885 --> 01:04:23,800
Then we found jobs
for six other people

1048
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:26,045
and they've all gone off relief.

1049
01:04:26,215 --> 01:04:27,492
And my boss, Mr. Schwabacher,

1050
01:04:27,659 --> 01:04:29,655
made a job in his warehouse
for old man Delaney.

1051
01:04:29,825 --> 01:04:32,550
- And he gave you a 5 dollar raise.
- Yeah. Isn't that swell?

1052
01:04:34,957 --> 01:04:36,154
Why, Bert...

1053
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:40,289
I feel slighted.
Nobody asked me to join.

1054
01:04:40,771 --> 01:04:44,615
Sorry, Mayor, we voted
no politician could join.

1055
01:04:44,781 --> 01:04:46,902
Just John Does of the neighborhood.

1056
01:04:47,067 --> 01:04:49,027
You know how politicians are.

1057
01:04:52,841 --> 01:04:56,685
The reason we wanted to
tell you this, Mr. Doe,

1058
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:59,976
was to give you an idea
of what you started.

1059
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:01,856
From where I'm sitting,

1060
01:05:02,425 --> 01:05:04,992
I don't see any sense in
you jumping off any building.

1061
01:05:05,352 --> 01:05:06,788
No!

1062
01:05:07,879 --> 01:05:09,395
Thank you for listening.

1063
01:05:10,565 --> 01:05:11,921
Goodbye, Mr. Doe.

1064
01:05:13,051 --> 01:05:14,727
You're a wonderful man.

1065
01:05:14,896 --> 01:05:18,374
It strikes me you'd be useful
walking around for a while.

1066
01:05:19,266 --> 01:05:20,862
Goodbye, Mr. Doe.

1067
01:05:28,931 --> 01:05:31,245
I'm Mrs. Delaney, Mr. Doe.

1068
01:05:31,417 --> 01:05:33,777
God bless you, my boy.

1069
01:06:07,827 --> 01:06:09,628
I'm all mixed up.

1070
01:06:13,601 --> 01:06:14,832
I don't get it.

1071
01:06:16,849 --> 01:06:19,849
All those swell people think
I'm gonna jump off a building.

1072
01:06:20,016 --> 01:06:21,852
I never had any such idea.

1073
01:06:23,866 --> 01:06:24,984
Gosh!

1074
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:29,234
A fella would have to be
a fine example to tell others...

1075
01:06:30,242 --> 01:06:32,762
What happened the other night
was on account of Miss Mitchell.

1076
01:06:32,929 --> 01:06:34,251
She wrote the stuff.

1077
01:06:34,412 --> 01:06:36,807
Don't you see what a
wonderful thing this can be?

1078
01:06:36,978 --> 01:06:38,895
- But we need you, John.
- You're hooked.

1079
01:06:39,064 --> 01:06:42,302
I can see that. They got you.
Well, I'm through.

1080
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:48,243
3 years I been trying to get you
up to the Columbia River country.

1081
01:06:48,407 --> 01:06:52,250
First it was your glass arm,
then the radio, now the Clubs.

1082
01:06:52,417 --> 01:06:53,978
I ain't waiting another minute.

1083
01:06:56,547 --> 01:06:58,383
Gangway, you Heelots!

1084
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:01,752
Colonel, wait a minute.

1085
01:07:03,003 --> 01:07:03,960
Hey, Colonel!

1086
01:07:04,126 --> 01:07:06,566
I want you to go with
John Doe and Miss Mitchell

1087
01:07:06,732 --> 01:07:08,374
and handle press and radio.

1088
01:07:08,537 --> 01:07:10,213
- Me?
- Yes, I won't take any chances.

1089
01:07:10,382 --> 01:07:11,499
- And Johnson.
- Yes, D.B.?

1090
01:07:11,664 --> 01:07:13,979
Your crew will mop up,
follow John Doe into every town,

1091
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:17,629
see the clubs are organized
and charters issued.

1092
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,442
There are 8 flags there now.

1093
01:07:19,604 --> 01:07:22,364
I want to see that map covered
before we get through.

1094
01:08:28,615 --> 01:08:32,093
This has grown like wildfire.
I'd understand demands,

1095
01:08:32,264 --> 01:08:33,541
but the John Does ask for nothing.

1096
01:08:35,232 --> 01:08:37,876
People are going off relief.
It keeps up, I'm out of a job.

1097
01:08:38,038 --> 01:08:40,512
When John Doe gets strong enough,
we'll find out what he wants.

1098
01:08:40,684 --> 01:08:43,046
Thirty every Thursday,
sixty at sixty!

1099
01:08:43,211 --> 01:08:44,887
Who knows what?

1100
01:08:45,056 --> 01:08:48,180
Sorry, boss, they won't let anybody
talk politics with him. It's crazy.

1101
01:08:48,945 --> 01:08:50,267
We've got to get to them.

1102
01:08:50,429 --> 01:08:52,824
They represent millions of voters.

1103
01:09:01,256 --> 01:09:04,734
Ladies and gentlemen,
this has been a prairie fire.

1104
01:09:04,905 --> 01:09:07,299
We've got so many applications
for John Doe charters

1105
01:09:07,471 --> 01:09:08,953
we can't take care of them.

1106
01:09:09,155 --> 01:09:11,310
I'd hate to have
that many pins stuck in me.

1107
01:09:11,761 --> 01:09:15,285
This John Doe convention is
going to put our city on the map.

1108
01:09:15,891 --> 01:09:19,735
2,400 John Doe Clubs
are sending delegates. Imagine!

1109
01:09:19,902 --> 01:09:23,220
Mr. Mayor, you will be the host.
Decorate the city, parades...

1110
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:25,705
and a reception for John Doe
when he gets home.

1111
01:09:25,876 --> 01:09:27,279
And don't wear your high hat.

1112
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,437
- No high hat?
- No high hat.

1113
01:09:29,605 --> 01:09:32,045
And Connell, I want a
John Doe edition every day

1114
01:09:32,212 --> 01:09:34,173
until the convention is over.

1115
01:09:34,338 --> 01:09:36,379
And now please step into
the outer office

1116
01:09:36,542 --> 01:09:39,987
and look your prettiest
for the photographers.

1117
01:09:40,152 --> 01:09:42,307
Don't worry, D.B.,
everything'll be taken care of.

1118
01:09:42,477 --> 01:09:43,994
Isn't it all too wonderful?

1119
01:09:46,768 --> 01:09:48,684
Mr. Mayor,
step down in front, please.

1120
01:09:48,854 --> 01:09:50,085
You ladies get close to him.

1121
01:09:50,617 --> 01:09:52,739
- I don't get it.
- Get what?

1122
01:09:52,984 --> 01:09:55,378
I'm meant to know my way around.

1123
01:09:55,549 --> 01:09:57,911
This John Doe movement's
cost you a fortune.

1124
01:09:58,076 --> 01:09:59,958
The convention will cost plenty.

1125
01:10:00,121 --> 01:10:01,112
Well?

1126
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:04,888
I'm stuck with 2 and 2
and I can't make 4 out of it.

1127
01:10:05,254 --> 01:10:06,451
Where do you come in?

1128
01:10:10,025 --> 01:10:11,827
I have the satisfaction of knowing

1129
01:10:11,991 --> 01:10:14,465
my money has been spent
for a worthy cause.

1130
01:10:15,319 --> 01:10:17,679
I see. I better stick to
running the paper, huh?

1131
01:10:18,366 --> 01:10:19,883
I think you better had.

1132
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:24,897
Connell,

1133
01:10:25,464 --> 01:10:27,619
I'd like to have
the John Doe contract,

1134
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:30,708
receipts for money we advanced
for Miss Mitchell's letter

1135
01:10:30,877 --> 01:10:32,758
for which I gave her 1,000.

1136
01:10:33,444 --> 01:10:34,960
Yes, sure.

1137
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:38,651
We leave for the airport
in half an hour.

1138
01:10:38,817 --> 01:10:40,858
Is that Johnny boy's room?
Better hustle him up.

1139
01:10:41,023 --> 01:10:42,823
He'll be ready. He's packing.

1140
01:10:42,987 --> 01:10:45,907
- See his photo on the cover of Time?
- Yeah.

1141
01:10:46,074 --> 01:10:47,558
I gotta give you credit, Annie.

1142
01:10:47,718 --> 01:10:50,034
I've handled many
big promotions in my time,

1143
01:10:50,205 --> 01:10:52,679
from the World's Fair
to a Channel swimmer,

1144
01:10:52,851 --> 01:10:55,052
but this has got me spinning.

1145
01:10:55,819 --> 01:10:58,054
And now,
a John Doe convention.

1146
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:03,909
If you could get him to jump
off City Hall on Christmas Eve,

1147
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,802
I'd guarantee you
half a million people there.

1148
01:11:06,966 --> 01:11:08,449
- Charlie?
- Hmm?

1149
01:11:08,611 --> 01:11:09,842
What do you make of him?

1150
01:11:10,495 --> 01:11:11,647
Johnny boy?

1151
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:16,263
I don't know what angle you want
but I'll give it to you quick.

1152
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:19,948
One, he's got great yokel appeal,
but he's a nice guy.

1153
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:23,318
Two, he's beginning to believe
he wrote that suicide letter

1154
01:11:23,487 --> 01:11:24,605
that you made up.

1155
01:11:24,851 --> 01:11:27,895
Three, he thinks you're
Joan of Arc or something.

1156
01:11:28,059 --> 01:11:29,096
I know.

1157
01:11:29,262 --> 01:11:31,257
Four, well...

1158
01:11:31,427 --> 01:11:33,822
you know what number four is.
He's nuts about you.

1159
01:11:33,994 --> 01:11:35,794
It's runnin' out of his ears.

1160
01:11:36,078 --> 01:11:39,237
You left out five.
We're all heels, me especially.

1161
01:11:39,567 --> 01:11:40,719
Holy smoke.

1162
01:11:41,973 --> 01:11:42,965
Come in.

1163
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:49,907
I'm all packed.

1164
01:11:50,073 --> 01:11:51,908
Good, I'll get Beany boy.

1165
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,402
Okay, Charlie boy.

1166
01:12:06,634 --> 01:12:08,036
Can I help you pack?

1167
01:12:08,839 --> 01:12:10,116
No, thank you.

1168
01:12:19,545 --> 01:12:22,306
- Care if I sit down, out here?
- No.

1169
01:12:32,858 --> 01:12:34,055
You know,

1170
01:12:34,343 --> 01:12:36,703
I had a crazy dream last night.

1171
01:12:39,034 --> 01:12:40,311
It was about you.

1172
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,751
About me?

1173
01:12:43,004 --> 01:12:44,839
Sure was crazy.

1174
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:47,172
I dreamt I was your father.

1175
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:55,829
There was something I was
trying to stop you from doing.

1176
01:12:56,437 --> 01:12:59,277
So, I got out of bed,

1177
01:13:00,086 --> 01:13:03,724
I walked right through the wall,
straight into your room.

1178
01:13:04,296 --> 01:13:05,972
You know how dreams are.

1179
01:13:06,502 --> 01:13:08,463
You were there in bed,

1180
01:13:08,668 --> 01:13:11,188
but you were a girl, about 10...

1181
01:13:11,915 --> 01:13:13,557
and very pretty, too.

1182
01:13:14,803 --> 01:13:16,718
I shook you and...

1183
01:13:17,690 --> 01:13:19,731
the moment you opened
your eyes, you hopped out of bed

1184
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:22,176
and started running like
the devil. In your nightgown!

1185
01:13:22,341 --> 01:13:25,580
You ran out the window,
over the tops of buildings

1186
01:13:25,749 --> 01:13:28,269
and roofs for miles
and I was chasing you.

1187
01:13:30,361 --> 01:13:32,927
All the time you were running,
you kept growing bigger

1188
01:13:33,088 --> 01:13:34,730
and bigger and bigger.

1189
01:13:35,293 --> 01:13:38,691
Soon you were as big as you
are now, you know? Grown up?

1190
01:13:39,785 --> 01:13:41,540
And all the time

1191
01:13:41,949 --> 01:13:44,755
I'm asking myself:
"What am I chasing her for?"

1192
01:13:45,318 --> 01:13:46,755
And I didn't know.

1193
01:13:48,165 --> 01:13:49,682
Isn't that a hot one?

1194
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:55,130
Anyway, you ran into some place
and I ran in after you.

1195
01:13:55,704 --> 01:13:59,627
When I got there,
you were getting married.

1196
01:14:02,199 --> 01:14:04,435
The nightgown had changed into

1197
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:06,681
a beautiful wedding gown.

1198
01:14:08,616 --> 01:14:10,372
You sure looked pretty, too.

1199
01:14:11,623 --> 01:14:14,702
Then I knew what I was
trying to stop you from doing.

1200
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:17,836
Dreams are crazy, aren't they?

1201
01:14:18,641 --> 01:14:19,473
Well,

1202
01:14:21,167 --> 01:14:22,888
like to know who you were marrying?

1203
01:14:25,698 --> 01:14:28,424
A tall handsome Ubangi,
I suppose.

1204
01:14:29,106 --> 01:14:32,390
Not that bad. It was the fella
that sends you flowers every day.

1205
01:14:32,675 --> 01:14:35,275
What's his name?
Mr. Norton's nephew?

1206
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:38,320
- Ted Sheldon.
- Yeah, that's the one.

1207
01:14:39,852 --> 01:14:41,688
But here's the funniest part.

1208
01:14:42,339 --> 01:14:45,099
I was the fella there,
doing the marrying.

1209
01:14:45,266 --> 01:14:47,387
- Justice of the Peace or something.
- You were?

1210
01:14:47,632 --> 01:14:49,069
I thought you were chasing me.

1211
01:14:49,236 --> 01:14:51,881
Yes, I was your father then,

1212
01:14:52,845 --> 01:14:55,159
but the real me,
John Doe, that is...

1213
01:14:55,331 --> 01:14:59,253
Long John Willoughby,
was the fella with a book.

1214
01:15:00,263 --> 01:15:02,224
- You know what I mean?
- I guess so.

1215
01:15:02,389 --> 01:15:03,620
Then what happened?

1216
01:15:04,393 --> 01:15:08,362
Well, I took you across my knee
and started spankin' ya.

1217
01:15:08,925 --> 01:15:10,441
That is, I didn't do it...

1218
01:15:10,609 --> 01:15:14,133
I mean I did do it.
See, I was your father then.

1219
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:17,220
I had you across my knee
and I said:

1220
01:15:17,787 --> 01:15:18,504
"Annie,

1221
01:15:19,952 --> 01:15:22,073
I won't allow you
to marry a man

1222
01:15:22,398 --> 01:15:23,800
that's just rich

1223
01:15:23,962 --> 01:15:26,847
or that has his secretary
send you flowers.

1224
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:30,928
The man you marry
has got to swim rivers for you,

1225
01:15:31,421 --> 01:15:34,146
climb mountains for you,
slay dragons for you.

1226
01:15:34,308 --> 01:15:38,026
He's got to perform
wonderful deeds for you!

1227
01:15:38,478 --> 01:15:41,876
All the time, the guy
up there with the book, me,

1228
01:15:42,087 --> 01:15:43,603
stood there noddin' his head

1229
01:15:44,092 --> 01:15:47,057
and he said:
"Go to it, whack her for me.

1230
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:49,500
That's the way I feel too."

1231
01:15:49,986 --> 01:15:52,906
He says: "Come down
and whack her yourself."

1232
01:15:53,274 --> 01:15:56,160
So I came down
and whacked you a good one.

1233
01:15:56,563 --> 01:15:59,002
See? He whacked and I whacked.

1234
01:15:59,169 --> 01:16:01,324
We both started whacking you...

1235
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:04,852
If you're through whacking her,
let's get going.

1236
01:16:05,063 --> 01:16:05,976
Okay, right in here.

1237
01:16:07,029 --> 01:16:09,833
You go out the side entrance.
Autograph seekers out front.

1238
01:16:10,436 --> 01:16:13,003
We'll be down
with the bags in a minute.

1239
01:16:14,246 --> 01:16:16,892
Come on, don't make
a Government project out of this.

1240
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:20,893
Hi, Beany.

1241
01:16:21,424 --> 01:16:24,149
- When's our plane take off?
- Couple of minutes.

1242
01:16:25,434 --> 01:16:27,908
How many people
have we talked to already,

1243
01:16:28,081 --> 01:16:29,723
outside the radio, I mean?

1244
01:16:29,884 --> 01:16:32,120
I don't know. About 300,000.

1245
01:16:32,932 --> 01:16:34,163
300,000.

1246
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:37,296
What makes them do it, Ann?

1247
01:16:37,864 --> 01:16:39,986
What makes them come and listen

1248
01:16:40,592 --> 01:16:43,556
and get up John Doe Clubs?

1249
01:16:44,922 --> 01:16:46,279
I've been trying to figure it out.

1250
01:16:46,445 --> 01:16:47,403
Look, John...

1251
01:16:47,569 --> 01:16:50,967
we're handing them platitudes
they've heard a million times.

1252
01:16:51,137 --> 01:16:53,053
Love thy neighbor,
clouds have silver linings,

1253
01:16:53,223 --> 01:16:56,702
- turn the other cheek. It's just...
- I heard 'em a million times,

1254
01:16:58,396 --> 01:16:59,593
but maybe they're like me,

1255
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:02,847
just beginning to get an idea

1256
01:17:03,006 --> 01:17:04,603
what those things mean.

1257
01:17:05,894 --> 01:17:07,855
I never really thought
about the people before.

1258
01:17:08,019 --> 01:17:10,334
They were just somebody
to fill up the bleachers.

1259
01:17:10,946 --> 01:17:13,147
Only time I worried about them

1260
01:17:13,473 --> 01:17:15,788
was when they didn't see me pitch.

1261
01:17:17,443 --> 01:17:18,434
You know,

1262
01:17:18,806 --> 01:17:21,486
lately I've been watching them
when I talk to them.

1263
01:17:22,575 --> 01:17:24,856
I see something in their faces.

1264
01:17:25,863 --> 01:17:27,459
I could feel that...

1265
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:30,996
they were hungry for something.

1266
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:33,517
You know what I mean?

1267
01:17:33,843 --> 01:17:35,678
Maybe that's why they came.

1268
01:17:36,209 --> 01:17:38,364
Maybe they're lonely and...

1269
01:17:38,535 --> 01:17:40,576
wanted somebody to say hello to.

1270
01:17:42,104 --> 01:17:43,665
I know how they feel.

1271
01:17:44,389 --> 01:17:48,392
I've been lonely and hungry
for something all my life.

1272
01:17:54,655 --> 01:17:56,331
All aboard, folks.

1273
01:17:57,141 --> 01:17:59,901
- We'll have the city behind us.
- Yeah, that's true.

1274
01:18:00,228 --> 01:18:03,194
- Somebody else sitting here?
- No, that's your seat.

1275
01:18:03,557 --> 01:18:05,199
And this is your coat.

1276
01:18:05,642 --> 01:18:08,607
- Mine?
- A little token of appreciation.

1277
01:18:12,739 --> 01:18:15,054
It's beautiful, D.B.

1278
01:18:16,227 --> 01:18:19,513
- I don't quite know what to say.
- Say nothing, just sit down.

1279
01:18:24,449 --> 01:18:26,044
Go ahead, open it.

1280
01:18:34,112 --> 01:18:35,264
It's lovely.

1281
01:18:35,676 --> 01:18:36,953
And a new contract goes with it.

1282
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:42,243
Well, spring it.

1283
01:18:43,255 --> 01:18:45,935
Something's on your mind.

1284
01:18:46,583 --> 01:18:48,020
Must be stupendous.

1285
01:18:48,829 --> 01:18:52,193
That's what I like about her.
Right to the point.

1286
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:57,364
Practical Annie, here it is.

1287
01:18:57,530 --> 01:19:00,416
Tomorrow night,
before a crowd of 15,000,

1288
01:19:00,577 --> 01:19:04,375
and over a nationwide
radio hook-up, John Doe

1289
01:19:04,989 --> 01:19:06,870
will announce the formation
of a third party.

1290
01:19:07,153 --> 01:19:08,750
A third party?

1291
01:19:09,039 --> 01:19:11,114
Yes, the John Doe Party,

1292
01:19:11,284 --> 01:19:13,040
devoted entirely to
the interests of

1293
01:19:13,209 --> 01:19:15,888
John Does all over the country.

1294
01:19:16,056 --> 01:19:17,971
Which practically means...

1295
01:19:19,183 --> 01:19:20,940
90o/o of the voters.

1296
01:19:21,309 --> 01:19:24,068
He'll also announce this party's

1297
01:19:24,236 --> 01:19:26,676
candidate for the presidency.

1298
01:19:27,244 --> 01:19:30,209
A man who
he personally recommends.

1299
01:19:30,371 --> 01:19:31,568
A great humanitarian.

1300
01:19:31,735 --> 01:19:33,650
The best friend
the John Does have.

1301
01:19:35,143 --> 01:19:36,785
Mr. D.B. Norton.

1302
01:19:37,148 --> 01:19:38,106
Yes.

1303
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:45,643
Wow!

1304
01:20:11,634 --> 01:20:14,108
The opening of the convention
is only hours off.

1305
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,674
The delegates are pouring into
the ball park with lunch baskets,

1306
01:20:16,846 --> 01:20:19,651
banners and petitions
asking John Doe

1307
01:20:19,814 --> 01:20:21,136
not to jump off any roof.

1308
01:20:21,297 --> 01:20:24,377
No matter how you look at it,
it's still a phenomenal movement.

1309
01:20:24,665 --> 01:20:28,350
These John Does or 'hoy polloi',
as you've heard people call them,

1310
01:20:28,515 --> 01:20:31,320
have been laughed at
and ridiculed.

1311
01:20:31,483 --> 01:20:34,402
But here they are gay and happy,
having traveled 1,000s of miles,

1312
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:37,615
their expenses paid
by their neighbors to come

1313
01:20:37,778 --> 01:20:40,458
to pay homage to their hero.

1314
01:20:40,745 --> 01:20:43,984
In these days of wars
and bombings, it's a hopeful sign

1315
01:20:44,154 --> 01:20:46,754
that a simple idea like this
can sweep the country.

1316
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:50,399
An idea based on friendliness,
on giving and not taking,

1317
01:20:50,569 --> 01:20:53,375
on helping your neighbor
and asking nothing in return.

1318
01:20:53,537 --> 01:20:57,016
If this can happen,
don't let your grumbling friends

1319
01:20:57,186 --> 01:21:00,105
tell you that
humanity is falling apart.

1320
01:21:00,274 --> 01:21:03,831
This is John B. Hughes
returning you to our main studio

1321
01:21:04,003 --> 01:21:07,083
until 9 o'clock when
the convention officially opens.

1322
01:21:09,215 --> 01:21:10,938
John, come in.

1323
01:21:11,782 --> 01:21:13,139
Say, I'm kind of...

1324
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:15,423
It's raining out a little.

1325
01:21:15,591 --> 01:21:16,743
That's all right.

1326
01:21:16,915 --> 01:21:18,830
Good to see you. Sit down.

1327
01:21:19,361 --> 01:21:20,319
Thanks.

1328
01:21:35,642 --> 01:21:36,873
It's for Ann.

1329
01:21:37,205 --> 01:21:40,444
- How nice. Thank you very much.
- Flowers.

1330
01:21:42,137 --> 01:21:43,779
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.

1331
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,582
She isn't?

1332
01:21:45,746 --> 01:21:47,982
She just left. I'm surprised
you didn't run into her.

1333
01:21:48,152 --> 01:21:49,828
She went to Mr. Norton's house.

1334
01:21:53,204 --> 01:21:55,565
Is it important?

1335
01:21:56,172 --> 01:21:58,567
Yeah. Well, no.
It'll wait.

1336
01:22:00,101 --> 01:22:03,020
He's a nice man, isn't he?
Mr. Norton, I mean.

1337
01:22:03,189 --> 01:22:05,663
He's done a lot for the...

1338
01:22:12,853 --> 01:22:15,053
Say, my coat's pretty wet.

1339
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:17,582
I might have wet the couch.

1340
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:25,801
I'll see her at the convention.

1341
01:22:25,966 --> 01:22:28,121
Yes, I'll see she gets the flowers.

1342
01:22:29,133 --> 01:22:30,171
Thanks.

1343
01:22:30,376 --> 01:22:32,577
- Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
- Good night, John.

1344
01:22:39,038 --> 01:22:40,156
Mrs. Mitchell...

1345
01:22:41,483 --> 01:22:44,643
I'm kind of glad Ann isn't here.

1346
01:22:45,935 --> 01:22:49,904
You see, I came here
hoping to see her alone

1347
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:53,145
and kind of hoping I wouldn't.

1348
01:22:54,597 --> 01:22:57,037
I wanted to talk to her.

1349
01:22:59,970 --> 01:23:01,851
It can wait, I guess.

1350
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:05,578
- Good night.
- Good night, John.

1351
01:23:09,473 --> 01:23:12,118
Mrs. Mitchell,
have you ever been married?

1352
01:23:13,122 --> 01:23:14,879
Well, sure you have.

1353
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:16,605
That's pretty silly.

1354
01:23:17,854 --> 01:23:20,215
Guess you think I'm batty.

1355
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:23,784
I guess I better be going.

1356
01:23:26,355 --> 01:23:27,347
John...

1357
01:23:29,282 --> 01:23:32,361
my husband said:
"I love you. Will you marry me?"

1358
01:23:33,172 --> 01:23:34,290
He did?

1359
01:23:35,177 --> 01:23:37,377
- What happened?
- I married him.

1360
01:23:38,986 --> 01:23:40,982
Yeah, that's what I mean.

1361
01:23:41,512 --> 01:23:42,949
It was easy as all that?

1362
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:46,596
Yeah, but look Mr. Mitchell...

1363
01:23:47,727 --> 01:23:49,404
I love Ann,

1364
01:23:49,572 --> 01:23:52,617
and it's gonna be hard
for me to say it 'cause...

1365
01:23:53,101 --> 01:23:55,667
she's so wonderful

1366
01:23:56,068 --> 01:23:59,672
and the best I ever was
was a bush league pitcher.

1367
01:24:00,881 --> 01:24:03,526
And I think
she's in love with another man,

1368
01:24:03,687 --> 01:24:06,926
the one she made up.
The real John Doe.

1369
01:24:07,697 --> 01:24:10,457
That's pretty tough competition.

1370
01:24:10,985 --> 01:24:13,266
I bet he'd know how to say it.

1371
01:24:13,431 --> 01:24:16,749
But me, I get up to it
and around and in back of it,

1372
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:20,558
but I never get right to it.
You know what I mean?

1373
01:24:21,371 --> 01:24:23,412
So the only chance I've got,

1374
01:24:23,577 --> 01:24:26,735
well, if somebody could
give her a warning.

1375
01:24:26,905 --> 01:24:29,379
Prepare her for the shock?

1376
01:24:30,634 --> 01:24:31,865
You'd like me to do it?

1377
01:24:33,842 --> 01:24:37,639
Well, I was thinking,
sort of break the ice.

1378
01:24:39,737 --> 01:24:41,253
Of course I will, John.

1379
01:24:44,709 --> 01:24:45,986
Thank you, Mrs. Mitchell.

1380
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:48,832
Hey, you're okay.

1381
01:25:00,989 --> 01:25:03,954
The John Doe meeting will be
one of the biggest things ever.

1382
01:25:04,117 --> 01:25:06,922
They're coming from all over:
trains, boxcars, wagons.

1383
01:25:07,084 --> 01:25:08,361
Look out!

1384
01:25:08,768 --> 01:25:10,889
- Hello, bodyguards. Had dinner?
- Not yet.

1385
01:25:11,054 --> 01:25:12,935
- That's all right.
- No, go and have dinner.

1386
01:25:13,099 --> 01:25:14,421
Wait a minute, John.

1387
01:25:18,994 --> 01:25:21,069
- Hello, Mr. Connell.
- How are you, John?

1388
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:24,206
I want to have
a little talk with you.

1389
01:25:25,810 --> 01:25:28,695
What's the matter?
Are you falling?

1390
01:25:29,098 --> 01:25:31,060
- Hey, Boss.
- Oh, quiet, quiet.

1391
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:35,153
Did you read the speech
you're going to make tonight?

1392
01:25:35,313 --> 01:25:37,834
No, I never read the speeches
before I make them.

1393
01:25:38,001 --> 01:25:39,517
I get more of a kick out of it.

1394
01:25:39,685 --> 01:25:41,361
Exactly what I thought.

1395
01:25:41,609 --> 01:25:45,054
Beany, go to the office, tell Pop
to give you the speech.

1396
01:25:45,218 --> 01:25:48,697
Mr. Norton told me not to
leave him, even for a minute.

1397
01:25:48,868 --> 01:25:51,593
Go on, go on. We'll be at
Jim's Bar, up the street.

1398
01:25:52,998 --> 01:25:54,594
You're a nice guy, John.

1399
01:25:55,003 --> 01:25:58,239
I like you. You're gentle.

1400
01:25:59,173 --> 01:26:01,329
I always like gentle people.

1401
01:26:01,659 --> 01:26:04,264
Me... I'm hard.

1402
01:26:04,265 --> 01:26:06,807
Hard and tough.

1403
01:26:06,808 --> 01:26:09,014
I got no use for hard people.

1404
01:26:10,015 --> 01:26:12,021
Gotta be gentle to suit me.

1405
01:26:16,021 --> 01:26:18,528
Like you, for instance.

1406
01:26:25,028 --> 01:26:27,680
Yep, I'm hard.
But you want to know something?

1407
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,153
I've got a weakness.

1408
01:26:30,766 --> 01:26:33,448
You'd never guess. Well, I have.

1409
01:26:34,337 --> 01:26:35,615
Wanna know what it is?

1410
01:26:36,585 --> 01:26:38,708
"The Star Spangled Banner."

1411
01:26:39,354 --> 01:26:42,515
Screwy, huh? Maybe it is.

1412
01:26:42,684 --> 01:26:46,166
Play it and I'm a sucker for it.

1413
01:26:47,219 --> 01:26:50,586
Always gets me right here.
You know what I mean?

1414
01:26:51,192 --> 01:26:53,189
Yeah, it gets me right back here.

1415
01:26:53,841 --> 01:26:55,278
Back there, huh?

1416
01:26:55,766 --> 01:26:58,574
Well, every man
to his own taste.

1417
01:27:01,745 --> 01:27:03,903
You weren't old enough

1418
01:27:04,394 --> 01:27:07,156
for the world war.

1419
01:27:07,725 --> 01:27:08,956
No, of course not.

1420
01:27:09,731 --> 01:27:11,694
You must have been just a kid.

1421
01:27:12,902 --> 01:27:13,974
I was.

1422
01:27:15,189 --> 01:27:17,345
I was just ripe...

1423
01:27:18,319 --> 01:27:20,122
and raring to go.

1424
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:24,217
Know what my old man did
when I joined up?

1425
01:27:24,379 --> 01:27:25,816
He joined up too.

1426
01:27:26,304 --> 01:27:27,788
Got to be a sergeant.

1427
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:31,270
We were in the same outfit.

1428
01:27:32,525 --> 01:27:33,848
Funny, huh?

1429
01:27:39,307 --> 01:27:41,190
He was killed, John.

1430
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:44,752
I saw him get it.

1431
01:27:46,570 --> 01:27:50,177
I was right there and saw it
with my own eyes.

1432
01:27:55,611 --> 01:27:58,291
I came out without a scratch.

1433
01:28:00,143 --> 01:28:02,504
That is, excepting my ulcers.

1434
01:28:07,761 --> 01:28:10,761
I should be drinking milk.
This stuff is poison.

1435
01:28:11,811 --> 01:28:13,009
Hey, Jimmy!

1436
01:28:13,454 --> 01:28:15,576
- Yes, Mr. Connell?
- What do you say?

1437
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:16,779
All right.

1438
01:28:19,150 --> 01:28:21,270
I'm a sucker for this country.

1439
01:28:21,956 --> 01:28:25,845
For "The Star Spangled Banner"
and this country.

1440
01:28:26,005 --> 01:28:28,242
I like what we got here.

1441
01:28:28,532 --> 01:28:29,935
I like it!

1442
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:34,377
A guy can say what he wants

1443
01:28:34,547 --> 01:28:37,466
and do what he wants without
getting a bayonet in his belly.

1444
01:28:37,635 --> 01:28:38,787
And that's all right.

1445
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:41,041
- You betcha.
- Yeah.

1446
01:28:41,244 --> 01:28:44,642
And we don't anybody
changing that, do we?

1447
01:28:44,893 --> 01:28:46,649
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

1448
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:50,214
When they do, I get mad,

1449
01:28:50,466 --> 01:28:53,146
I get boiling mad.

1450
01:28:53,755 --> 01:28:56,799
Right now, I'm sizzling.

1451
01:28:57,926 --> 01:29:01,449
I get mad for a lot of
other guys besides myself.

1452
01:29:02,456 --> 01:29:05,455
I get mad for a guy
named Washington.

1453
01:29:06,226 --> 01:29:08,425
And a guy named Jefferson

1454
01:29:08,912 --> 01:29:10,144
and Lincoln.

1455
01:29:11,077 --> 01:29:13,119
Lighthouses, John.

1456
01:29:13,965 --> 01:29:17,044
Lighthouses in a foggy world.

1457
01:29:18,976 --> 01:29:20,300
You know what I mean?

1458
01:29:20,862 --> 01:29:22,217
Yeah, you bet.

1459
01:29:23,789 --> 01:29:25,020
Listen, pal.

1460
01:29:25,833 --> 01:29:29,039
This fifth column stuff
is pretty rotten, isn't it?

1461
01:29:29,643 --> 01:29:30,999
Yeah, it certainly is.

1462
01:29:31,528 --> 01:29:34,493
You'd feel like an awful sucker
marching in the middle of it,

1463
01:29:34,656 --> 01:29:35,887
wouldn't you?

1464
01:29:36,661 --> 01:29:38,862
You! You wouldn't know

1465
01:29:39,027 --> 01:29:41,067
because you're gentle.

1466
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:43,274
But that's what you're doing.

1467
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:47,119
You're mixed up
with a skunk, my boy.

1468
01:29:47,928 --> 01:29:51,293
A no-good, dangerous skunk.

1469
01:29:53,942 --> 01:29:56,178
You're not talking about Norton?

1470
01:29:56,670 --> 01:29:59,828
I'm not talking about
his grandfather's pet poodle.

1471
01:30:03,646 --> 01:30:05,323
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell.

1472
01:30:05,612 --> 01:30:07,811
He's been marvelous
about the John Doe Clubs.

1473
01:30:07,977 --> 01:30:09,015
Yeah.

1474
01:30:10,183 --> 01:30:13,502
You're sold on this John Doe idea?

1475
01:30:13,672 --> 01:30:16,671
- Sure.
- Yeah, I don't blame you.

1476
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,602
It's a beautiful miracle,

1477
01:30:18,965 --> 01:30:21,120
a miracle that can only happen

1478
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:23,857
right here in
the good old U.S.A,

1479
01:30:24,017 --> 01:30:26,697
and I think it's terrific.
What do you think of that?

1480
01:30:26,984 --> 01:30:29,060
Me, hard-boiled Connell,

1481
01:30:29,230 --> 01:30:31,750
and I think it's plenty terrific.

1482
01:30:31,917 --> 01:30:34,996
Alright. Now suppose
an unmentionable worm,

1483
01:30:35,164 --> 01:30:36,521
who's initials

1484
01:30:36,688 --> 01:30:39,003
are D.B.,

1485
01:30:39,455 --> 01:30:41,497
was trying to use that to

1486
01:30:41,661 --> 01:30:43,542
shove his way into the White House.

1487
01:30:43,987 --> 01:30:46,427
So he could put the screws on.

1488
01:30:46,954 --> 01:30:50,956
So he could turn out
the lights in the lighthouses.

1489
01:30:54,212 --> 01:30:55,774
What would you say about that?

1490
01:30:56,817 --> 01:30:58,939
Nobody's gonna do that.

1491
01:30:59,705 --> 01:31:02,466
They can't use
the John Doe Clubs for politics.

1492
01:31:02,633 --> 01:31:04,832
- That's the main idea.
- Is that so?

1493
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:08,885
Then what's a big political boss
like Hammett doing in town?

1494
01:31:09,048 --> 01:31:11,203
And a labor leader like Bennett.
And lots of other big shots

1495
01:31:11,374 --> 01:31:14,134
that are up at
D.B.'s house right now.

1496
01:31:14,382 --> 01:31:16,776
Wolves, John. Wolves.

1497
01:31:17,187 --> 01:31:19,914
Waiting to
cut up the John Does.

1498
01:31:21,119 --> 01:31:24,117
Wait till you get a gander
at your speech tonight.

1499
01:31:24,285 --> 01:31:27,172
You're all wet.
Miss Mitchell writes the speeches.

1500
01:31:27,332 --> 01:31:28,451
Nobody can make her write that.

1501
01:31:28,616 --> 01:31:29,847
They can't?

1502
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:32,300
Who writes 'em, my aunt Emma?

1503
01:31:32,547 --> 01:31:34,428
I know she writes them

1504
01:31:34,592 --> 01:31:37,158
and gets a big bonus
for doing them, too.

1505
01:31:37,398 --> 01:31:39,759
A mink coat and diamond bracelet.

1506
01:31:40,084 --> 01:31:41,408
Don't write 'em?

1507
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:44,935
Why that gold-grabbing dame
would double cross her own mother

1508
01:31:45,098 --> 01:31:47,902
- for a handful of Chinese Yams.
- Shut up!

1509
01:31:49,388 --> 01:31:50,824
If you weren't drunk, I'd...

1510
01:31:51,873 --> 01:31:53,026
Hey, Boss.

1511
01:31:53,878 --> 01:31:55,441
Here's the speech, Boss.

1512
01:31:57,207 --> 01:32:00,172
Read it, and then start sockin'.

1513
01:32:02,379 --> 01:32:04,102
Wait, Mr. Doe.

1514
01:32:06,108 --> 01:32:07,147
Jimmy.

1515
01:32:07,513 --> 01:32:10,033
- Yes, sir.
- Better bring me a glass of milk.

1516
01:32:11,844 --> 01:32:13,884
I'm smoking too much.

1517
01:32:17,858 --> 01:32:20,299
Yes, Charlie. Everything all set?

1518
01:32:20,624 --> 01:32:22,746
Fine.
John Doe been take care of?

1519
01:32:23,071 --> 01:32:23,984
Good.

1520
01:32:24,514 --> 01:32:27,480
How many people
will be there? 15,000?

1521
01:32:28,044 --> 01:32:29,365
Oh my, that's fine.

1522
01:32:29,848 --> 01:32:32,687
Listen, Charlie. As soon as
John Doe stops talking about me

1523
01:32:32,854 --> 01:32:35,740
I want you to start
that demonstration, a big one.

1524
01:32:36,223 --> 01:32:38,265
Don't worry about that, D.B.
My boys are there.

1525
01:32:38,429 --> 01:32:39,625
They'll take care of it.

1526
01:32:39,791 --> 01:32:42,359
Yes, I'll be there
15 minutes after I get your call.

1527
01:32:44,123 --> 01:32:45,684
Why, Mr. Doe!

1528
01:32:46,088 --> 01:32:48,562
- Where are they?
- In the dining room, sir.

1529
01:32:53,267 --> 01:32:56,507
Gentlemen, I think we're ready
to throw that big bombshell.

1530
01:32:56,676 --> 01:32:58,033
Yeah, it's about time.

1531
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:00,640
A conservative estimate shows

1532
01:33:00,807 --> 01:33:03,934
we can count on between
10 and 20 million John Doe votes.

1533
01:33:04,098 --> 01:33:07,222
Add that to the labor vote
Mr. Bennett will throw in.

1534
01:33:07,386 --> 01:33:10,192
And the votes controlled by
Mr. Hammett and you gentlemen,

1535
01:33:10,355 --> 01:33:12,191
and nothing can stop us.

1536
01:33:12,361 --> 01:33:14,003
As I said, I'm with you,

1537
01:33:14,206 --> 01:33:16,807
providing you can guarantee
the John Doe vote.

1538
01:33:16,972 --> 01:33:19,779
- Don't worry about that.
- Count on me, on one condition.

1539
01:33:20,223 --> 01:33:22,219
Little Bennett is taken care of.

1540
01:33:22,389 --> 01:33:24,864
Everybody will be taken care of.

1541
01:33:25,276 --> 01:33:27,079
My agreement with you stands.

1542
01:33:27,363 --> 01:33:28,594
I'm with you, D.B.,

1543
01:33:28,766 --> 01:33:31,493
but I still think it's
a daring thing we're attempting.

1544
01:33:31,734 --> 01:33:33,776
Daring times, Mr. Barrington.

1545
01:33:33,941 --> 01:33:37,704
We come to a new order of things.
Too much talk in this country.

1546
01:33:38,032 --> 01:33:39,437
Too many concessions made.

1547
01:33:39,597 --> 01:33:41,798
What the American people need
is an iron hand.

1548
01:33:41,963 --> 01:33:42,637
You're right, that's true.

1549
01:33:42,806 --> 01:33:43,877
You're right, D.B.

1550
01:33:44,048 --> 01:33:45,247
Discipline!

1551
01:33:47,378 --> 01:33:50,460
And now may I offer
a toast to Miss Ann Mitchell,

1552
01:33:52,151 --> 01:33:55,312
the brilliant and beautiful lady
who's responsible for all this.

1553
01:33:55,562 --> 01:33:56,839
Miss Mitchell.

1554
01:33:57,648 --> 01:33:59,724
Mr. Norton, I'd like to talk
to you alone for a minute.

1555
01:34:00,615 --> 01:34:02,612
Miss Mitchell has
something to say to us.

1556
01:34:03,022 --> 01:34:04,698
That's fine. Speech!

1557
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:10,277
Hello.

1558
01:34:18,265 --> 01:34:20,946
John, I'm glad to see you.
I was terribly worried.

1559
01:34:21,114 --> 01:34:22,310
Did you write this?

1560
01:34:23,159 --> 01:34:26,604
Yes I did, John, but I had
no idea what was going on.

1561
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:28,693
- You didn't?
- No.

1562
01:34:30,740 --> 01:34:32,623
Swell bracelet you're wearing.

1563
01:34:36,757 --> 01:34:38,878
John, why aren't you
at the convention?

1564
01:34:55,530 --> 01:34:56,852
Is there anything wrong?

1565
01:34:57,094 --> 01:34:58,452
No, nothing's wrong.

1566
01:34:59,021 --> 01:35:00,297
Everything's fine.

1567
01:35:01,427 --> 01:35:03,742
So there's going to be
a new order of things, huh?

1568
01:35:03,993 --> 01:35:07,632
Everybody's gonna cut himself
a nice fat slice of the John Does?

1569
01:35:08,567 --> 01:35:10,689
You forgot one detail,
Mr. Big Shot.

1570
01:35:10,854 --> 01:35:12,051
You forgot me,

1571
01:35:12,217 --> 01:35:14,052
the prize stooge of the world.

1572
01:35:14,343 --> 01:35:18,063
If you or anybody thinks
he's gonna use the John Doe Clubs

1573
01:35:18,234 --> 01:35:20,675
for his own rotten purpose,
he'll do it over my dead body.

1574
01:35:21,163 --> 01:35:24,562
Hold on a minute, young man.
That's rather big talk.

1575
01:35:24,733 --> 01:35:27,333
I started the John Doe Clubs
with my money

1576
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:30,021
and I'll decide whether or not
they're being properly used.

1577
01:35:30,187 --> 01:35:32,148
No, you won't.
You're through deciding anything.

1578
01:35:32,314 --> 01:35:34,788
What's more, I'm going
down to the convention

1579
01:35:34,961 --> 01:35:38,680
and tell those people what you
and your fine feathered friends

1580
01:35:38,852 --> 01:35:41,134
are cooking up for them.

1581
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:43,856
I'm gonna say it
in my own words this time.

1582
01:35:46,232 --> 01:35:47,956
He'll ruin us, D.B.!

1583
01:35:49,843 --> 01:35:51,600
Wait a minute, fella.

1584
01:35:51,768 --> 01:35:53,604
My uncle wants to talk to you.

1585
01:35:53,774 --> 01:35:55,176
Listen to me, my son.

1586
01:35:55,337 --> 01:35:57,413
Before you
lose your head completely,

1587
01:35:57,584 --> 01:36:00,060
may I remind you that
I picked you up out of the gutter,

1588
01:36:00,232 --> 01:36:02,389
and I can throw you
right back there again.

1589
01:36:02,879 --> 01:36:06,198
You've got a nerve
accusing people of things.

1590
01:36:06,369 --> 01:36:08,809
These men and I know what's best
for the John Does of America

1591
01:36:08,976 --> 01:36:10,937
regardless of what
tramps like you think.

1592
01:36:12,185 --> 01:36:15,230
Get off that righteous horse
and come to your senses.

1593
01:36:15,515 --> 01:36:18,401
You're the fake.
We believe in what we're doing.

1594
01:36:18,564 --> 01:36:21,769
You were paid your 30 pieces
of silver. Have you forgotten that?

1595
01:36:21,933 --> 01:36:23,085
Well, I haven't.

1596
01:36:23,257 --> 01:36:25,778
You're a fake, John Doe,
and I can prove it.

1597
01:36:25,984 --> 01:36:29,508
You're the big hero that's
meant to jump off tall buildings.

1598
01:36:29,714 --> 01:36:33,034
Remember? What will your
precious John Does say

1599
01:36:33,203 --> 01:36:35,599
when they find out you never
had any intention of doing it?

1600
01:36:35,771 --> 01:36:37,688
That you were paid to say so?

1601
01:36:37,857 --> 01:36:39,899
You'd be run out of the country.

1602
01:36:40,264 --> 01:36:43,469
With the newspapers and radio
stations these gentlemen control,

1603
01:36:43,633 --> 01:36:46,201
we can kill the John Doe movement
deader than a doornail.

1604
01:36:46,361 --> 01:36:48,358
We'll do it the moment
you step out of line.

1605
01:36:50,171 --> 01:36:53,937
You want to go to the convention
and shoot your trap off,

1606
01:36:54,102 --> 01:36:55,460
go ahead and do it.

1607
01:37:03,008 --> 01:37:05,529
You mean, you'd try to kill
the John Doe movement

1608
01:37:05,696 --> 01:37:07,931
if you can't use it?

1609
01:37:08,304 --> 01:37:10,424
Bet your bottom dollar.

1610
01:37:16,405 --> 01:37:18,767
That's certainly is a new low.

1611
01:37:20,297 --> 01:37:22,497
Guess I've seen everything now.

1612
01:37:24,748 --> 01:37:27,430
You sit with your big cigars
and think of deliberately killing

1613
01:37:27,597 --> 01:37:30,757
an idea that's made millions
of people a bit happier.

1614
01:37:31,247 --> 01:37:34,967
An idea that's brought thousands
here from all over the country.

1615
01:37:35,139 --> 01:37:38,025
By bus, train, jalopy and foot

1616
01:37:38,188 --> 01:37:41,712
so they can pass on to each other
a little of their experiences.

1617
01:37:42,519 --> 01:37:45,725
I'm just a mug and I know it,

1618
01:37:45,930 --> 01:37:47,970
but I'm beginning to
understand a lot of things.

1619
01:37:48,135 --> 01:37:49,972
Your types are
as old as history.

1620
01:37:50,141 --> 01:37:53,061
If you can't lay your
dirty fingers on a decent idea,

1621
01:37:53,229 --> 01:37:55,830
and squeeze it into your pocket,

1622
01:37:56,318 --> 01:37:58,839
like dogs, if you can't eat it,
you bury it.

1623
01:37:59,927 --> 01:38:02,495
This is the one worthwhile
thing that's come along.

1624
01:38:02,696 --> 01:38:06,254
People finally find out
the guy next door isn't a bad egg.

1625
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:07,464
That's simple, isn't it?

1626
01:38:07,629 --> 01:38:09,945
Yet a thing like that
has got a chance of spreading

1627
01:38:10,116 --> 01:38:12,274
till it touches every
human being in the world,

1628
01:38:12,443 --> 01:38:14,404
and you talk about killing it.

1629
01:38:14,849 --> 01:38:17,132
Well, when this fire dies down,
what's going to be left?

1630
01:38:17,296 --> 01:38:19,864
More misery, hunger and hate.

1631
01:38:20,024 --> 01:38:22,500
And what's to prevent that
from starting all over again?

1632
01:38:22,671 --> 01:38:25,399
Nobody knows the answer to that
and certainly not you,

1633
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:27,761
with those slimy,
bollixed up theories you got.

1634
01:38:27,927 --> 01:38:31,293
The John Doe idea
may be the answer, the one thing

1635
01:38:31,457 --> 01:38:34,696
capable of saving this world,
and you sit on your fat hulks

1636
01:38:34,866 --> 01:38:36,987
and tell me you'll kill it
if you can't use it.

1637
01:38:37,152 --> 01:38:39,354
Well, go ahead and try.
You couldn't do it

1638
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:42,805
in a million years with all your
radio stations and your power

1639
01:38:43,089 --> 01:38:46,374
because it's bigger than
whether I'm a fake or your ambition

1640
01:38:46,538 --> 01:38:48,296
and bigger than all the bracelets
and fur coats in the world!

1641
01:38:48,463 --> 01:38:49,695
You bet it is, John.

1642
01:38:49,868 --> 01:38:52,389
That's exactly what
I'm going to tell those people.

1643
01:38:55,805 --> 01:38:58,966
You ungrateful rat!
My uncle's been too good to...

1644
01:39:00,457 --> 01:39:01,450
He's getting away.

1645
01:39:02,464 --> 01:39:03,102
John!

1646
01:39:03,266 --> 01:39:04,383
Get me the Bulletin.

1647
01:39:05,954 --> 01:39:06,944
John!

1648
01:39:07,678 --> 01:39:09,115
I told you, D.B.,

1649
01:39:09,282 --> 01:39:10,765
you're playing with dynamite.

1650
01:39:12,252 --> 01:39:13,689
Don't let that girl get away.

1651
01:39:14,817 --> 01:39:16,654
Before he gets through tonight,
he'll ruin us all.

1652
01:39:16,824 --> 01:39:19,060
I'll stop him cold.
I've been ready for this.

1653
01:39:19,231 --> 01:39:20,463
John!

1654
01:39:20,635 --> 01:39:22,517
John, please listen to me.

1655
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:25,727
I can explain. I didn't know
what they were going to do.

1656
01:39:25,890 --> 01:39:27,406
Let me go with you.

1657
01:39:27,895 --> 01:39:29,047
John, please!

1658
01:39:29,219 --> 01:39:31,135
Go ahead, driver.
Ball park.

1659
01:39:31,305 --> 01:39:33,951
Please let me go with you!
Please, John.

1660
01:39:34,113 --> 01:39:35,835
Please, John.

1661
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:37,922
Mr. Norton wants to see you.

1662
01:39:38,445 --> 01:39:41,170
Listen to me, Mayor.
I want them both arrested.

1663
01:39:41,332 --> 01:39:43,808
Tell the police to pick up Connell.
I've got the girl here.

1664
01:39:43,981 --> 01:39:47,665
I don't care, charge them.
Keep them in jail overnight.

1665
01:39:48,554 --> 01:39:50,594
Hello, Bulletin?
Put Buck Meyer on.

1666
01:40:41,061 --> 01:40:43,216
Three cheers for John Doe.

1667
01:41:35,857 --> 01:41:38,300
- Ladies and gentlemen.
- One moment, John.

1668
01:41:39,831 --> 01:41:41,829
We'll begin with a soft prayer.

1669
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:46,607
Quiet, please.

1670
01:41:47,898 --> 01:41:49,623
Ladies and gentlemen,

1671
01:41:49,785 --> 01:41:52,708
a moment of silent prayer

1672
01:41:53,038 --> 01:41:56,120
for the John Does
all over the world,

1673
01:41:56,650 --> 01:42:00,576
many of whom
are homeless and hungry.

1674
01:42:01,505 --> 01:42:02,864
Rise, please.

1675
01:42:04,156 --> 01:42:05,478
Everybody rise.

1676
01:42:57,299 --> 01:43:01,021
Hundreds of news boys
are swarming in like locusts.

1677
01:43:01,192 --> 01:43:02,916
They're yelling
"John Doe's a fake."

1678
01:43:16,004 --> 01:43:18,527
Federal investigation
urged by Chamber of Commerce.

1679
01:43:18,694 --> 01:43:21,980
- How could he be a fake?
- Must be some kind of a gag.

1680
01:43:22,145 --> 01:43:23,869
- A what?
- A gag!

1681
01:43:35,392 --> 01:43:36,875
Come on, step on it!

1682
01:43:38,602 --> 01:43:39,927
Step on it!

1683
01:43:40,088 --> 01:43:42,851
You all know you're places.
Wait for the signal.

1684
01:43:43,019 --> 01:43:45,300
- Will you autograph my balloon?
- Sure.

1685
01:43:55,019 --> 01:43:56,502
Ladies and gentlemen,

1686
01:43:57,468 --> 01:44:00,835
this is what I came down here
to tell you about.

1687
01:44:02,766 --> 01:44:05,414
Please, if you all just
be quiet for a few minutes,

1688
01:44:05,575 --> 01:44:07,379
I can explain this whole thing.

1689
01:44:09,229 --> 01:44:11,305
As you all know,
this paper is published

1690
01:44:11,475 --> 01:44:13,554
by a man by the name of
D.B. Norton...

1691
01:44:13,725 --> 01:44:15,003
Get back, you!

1692
01:44:16,012 --> 01:44:17,977
Everybody, wait a minute.

1693
01:44:19,463 --> 01:44:20,662
Ladies and gentlemen,

1694
01:44:22,955 --> 01:44:24,280
My name is D.B.Norton.

1695
01:44:24,441 --> 01:44:26,084
You all know me.

1696
01:44:26,407 --> 01:44:29,010
I accuse this man
of being a faker.

1697
01:44:29,177 --> 01:44:32,065
We've been taken for suckers
and I'm the biggest of the lot!

1698
01:44:32,310 --> 01:44:34,270
I spent a fortune backing this man

1699
01:44:34,435 --> 01:44:38,329
in what I believed was a sincere
and worthy cause, as you all did.

1700
01:44:39,694 --> 01:44:41,212
Now I find out it's
nothing but a cheap racket,

1701
01:44:41,620 --> 01:44:44,509
cooked up by him and two of
my employees for the purpose of

1702
01:44:44,672 --> 01:44:47,069
collecting dues from
John Does all over the country.

1703
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:48,232
That's a lie!

1704
01:44:48,444 --> 01:44:50,886
It's not a lie! Nickel and dimes
to stuff in their pockets.

1705
01:44:51,052 --> 01:44:53,176
You can read about it
in the newspapers there.

1706
01:44:53,341 --> 01:44:55,705
That's a lie! Don't believe...

1707
01:44:55,870 --> 01:44:58,519
This man had no intention
of jumping off a building.

1708
01:44:58,680 --> 01:45:01,077
He was paid to say so.
Do you deny that?

1709
01:45:01,247 --> 01:45:03,976
- That's got nothing to do with it.
- Were you paid or weren't you?

1710
01:45:04,138 --> 01:45:05,416
Yes, I was paid, but...

1711
01:45:05,583 --> 01:45:07,660
And the suicide note.
You didn't write that either.

1712
01:45:07,830 --> 01:45:09,747
- What difference does that make?
- Did you write it?

1713
01:45:10,159 --> 01:45:12,442
- No, I didn't.
- You bet your life you didn't.

1714
01:45:12,606 --> 01:45:14,126
Look in your papers and find

1715
01:45:14,294 --> 01:45:17,855
Miss Mitchell's signed confession
that she wrote it.

1716
01:45:18,026 --> 01:45:19,943
I didn't write the letter...

1717
01:45:20,113 --> 01:45:22,637
Now you see, he admits it.
You're a fake, John Doe.

1718
01:45:22,923 --> 01:45:25,207
For what you did to these people,

1719
01:45:25,493 --> 01:45:27,250
they ought to
run you out of the country.

1720
01:45:27,419 --> 01:45:29,257
And I hope they do it.

1721
01:45:38,175 --> 01:45:40,013
Speak up, John. We believe you.

1722
01:45:40,423 --> 01:45:41,703
Please listen, folks.

1723
01:45:42,431 --> 01:45:44,393
Now that he's through
shooting off his face,

1724
01:45:44,557 --> 01:45:46,360
I got some things to tell you.

1725
01:45:46,805 --> 01:45:49,248
The rest of you get in and riot.
Break this crowd up.

1726
01:45:49,415 --> 01:45:51,253
I'm sorry folks,
we can't hear him anymore.

1727
01:45:51,423 --> 01:45:53,419
Something's up with the speakers.

1728
01:45:53,950 --> 01:45:55,354
John Doe's a fake!

1729
01:45:56,681 --> 01:45:58,198
Please. They can't hear me.

1730
01:46:00,454 --> 01:46:01,684
This thing's not working.

1731
01:46:02,339 --> 01:46:03,619
Ladies and gentlemen...

1732
01:46:21,848 --> 01:46:24,449
This thing's bigger than
whether I'm a fake.

1733
01:46:26,344 --> 01:46:28,992
Bert, you believe me, don't ya?

1734
01:46:29,715 --> 01:46:31,598
Sure. I believe you.

1735
01:46:32,363 --> 01:46:36,371
Walking my legs off picking up
5,000 signatures for a phony.

1736
01:46:36,578 --> 01:46:38,302
There you are, Mr. Doe.

1737
01:46:38,465 --> 01:46:41,753
5,000 names asking you
not to jump off any roof.

1738
01:46:41,917 --> 01:46:44,233
Makes no difference, Bert.
The idea's still good.

1739
01:46:44,405 --> 01:46:47,168
- We don't have to give it up.
- Yeah, you can have it.

1740
01:46:50,748 --> 01:46:53,190
They're starting to throw things.
Somebody's going to get hurt.

1741
01:46:53,357 --> 01:46:55,355
I'm afraid it will be John Doe.

1742
01:46:55,525 --> 01:46:56,848
Listen to that mob.

1743
01:46:59,738 --> 01:47:01,177
I've got to go to him.

1744
01:47:01,345 --> 01:47:04,827
- Sorry, lady. I can't let you out.
- Let me go!

1745
01:47:04,997 --> 01:47:08,923
Please. They're crucifying him.
I can help him!

1746
01:47:09,091 --> 01:47:12,619
- We got orders to hold you.
- From who? It's a frame-up!

1747
01:47:12,784 --> 01:47:15,353
- Ann darling.
- Mother, they won't let me go.

1748
01:47:15,514 --> 01:47:17,156
They won't let me go.

1749
01:47:18,925 --> 01:47:20,123
Listen, folks.

1750
01:47:20,930 --> 01:47:22,850
You gotta listen to me!

1751
01:47:23,019 --> 01:47:26,386
Back to the jungle, you hobo.

1752
01:47:26,551 --> 01:47:27,545
Just another racket!

1753
01:47:28,077 --> 01:47:29,480
Stick to your clubs.

1754
01:47:29,682 --> 01:47:31,840
We've been fed baloney so long
we're getting used to it.

1755
01:47:41,282 --> 01:47:43,679
The idea is still good.

1756
01:47:45,055 --> 01:47:46,414
Believe me, folks.

1757
01:47:49,390 --> 01:47:52,278
John Does were
the hope of the world.

1758
01:48:29,289 --> 01:48:31,446
A friend got him out of the park.

1759
01:48:31,618 --> 01:48:33,181
Be a miracle if he's not hurt.

1760
01:48:33,503 --> 01:48:37,351
Ladies and gentlemen, looks like
the end of the John Doe movement.

1761
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:42,287
Well, boys, chalk up
another one to the Pontius Pilates.

1762
01:48:49,799 --> 01:48:51,719
I should have been there.

1763
01:48:52,407 --> 01:48:54,006
I could have helped him.

1764
01:48:55,861 --> 01:48:57,745
He was so all alone.

1765
01:49:01,239 --> 01:49:04,127
We ought to be ashamed
of ourselves after tonight.

1766
01:49:05,253 --> 01:49:07,615
We didn't give him a chance.

1767
01:49:17,576 --> 01:49:19,652
More coffee, Long John?

1768
01:49:20,627 --> 01:49:22,350
No thanks, Colonel.

1769
01:49:43,545 --> 01:49:45,303
- Fake!
- Racketeer!

1770
01:49:45,472 --> 01:49:47,390
- Liar!
- Cheat!

1771
01:49:47,559 --> 01:49:50,322
- Impostor!
- Why don't you jump?

1772
01:49:51,654 --> 01:49:53,093
Goodbye, Mr. Doe.

1773
01:49:53,981 --> 01:49:55,706
You're a wonderful man.

1774
01:49:56,391 --> 01:49:58,513
God bless you, my boy.

1775
01:49:59,922 --> 01:50:01,566
Now get in there and pitch.

1776
01:50:06,384 --> 01:50:07,709
You're a fake and I can prove it.

1777
01:50:07,870 --> 01:50:11,238
You're the big hero that's
meant to jump off tall buildings.

1778
01:50:11,603 --> 01:50:12,515
Remember?

1779
01:50:12,685 --> 01:50:15,128
What will your precious
John Does say when they find out

1780
01:50:15,295 --> 01:50:17,453
you had no intention of doing it?

1781
01:50:17,623 --> 01:50:19,221
That you were paid to say so?

1782
01:50:19,390 --> 01:50:21,514
Christmas Eve, at midnight.

1783
01:50:44,718 --> 01:50:46,202
Merry Christmas, sir.

1784
01:50:47,728 --> 01:50:48,959
Oh! Merry Christmas.

1785
01:51:16,548 --> 01:51:18,545
Who? John Doe?

1786
01:51:19,077 --> 01:51:20,993
Is that screwball still around?

1787
01:51:21,164 --> 01:51:23,446
That dame's been calling all day.

1788
01:51:23,612 --> 01:51:26,614
Sure, sure, I know.
At midnight, huh?

1789
01:51:27,346 --> 01:51:30,267
Okay, lady. We'll have
the place surrounded with nets.

1790
01:51:31,841 --> 01:51:33,518
They're laughing at me.

1791
01:51:39,468 --> 01:51:41,705
You're a sick girl, Ann.
You better take it easy.

1792
01:51:44,524 --> 01:51:45,883
Who are you calling now?

1793
01:51:46,973 --> 01:51:50,055
You called that number,
not ten minutes ago.

1794
01:51:50,946 --> 01:51:53,595
Hello. Mr. Connell.
Have you seen him yet?

1795
01:51:53,757 --> 01:51:56,644
Listen, Ann. He can't get in
without our seeing him.

1796
01:51:57,208 --> 01:52:00,529
I'm watching the side door.
Colonel's out front. Stop worrying.

1797
01:52:03,390 --> 01:52:04,428
Thank you.

1798
01:52:10,494 --> 01:52:12,811
- Why Ann!
- Ann, don't be foolish.

1799
01:52:17,077 --> 01:52:19,315
If this isn't the craziest,

1800
01:52:19,486 --> 01:52:21,563
the battiest, the looniest
wild goose chase I ever heard of.

1801
01:52:21,733 --> 01:52:23,250
Shut up, Bert.
Sourpuss is right.

1802
01:52:23,418 --> 01:52:25,462
If he is, I'm a banana split.

1803
01:52:25,626 --> 01:52:27,429
That man's gonna be on that roof.

1804
01:52:27,593 --> 01:52:30,276
Don't ask me how I know.
I know as well as you do.

1805
01:52:30,443 --> 01:52:31,881
I'd like to believe in fairy tales,

1806
01:52:32,049 --> 01:52:34,936
but a guy that's a fake
won't jump off any roof.

1807
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:38,028
I don't think he was a fake.
Not with that face.

1808
01:52:38,190 --> 01:52:41,911
- What he stood for wasn't a fake.
- Okay, honey. Okay.

1809
01:53:00,869 --> 01:53:02,353
Elevators ain't runnin'.

1810
01:53:03,197 --> 01:53:05,673
- Colonel.
- You shouldn't be out of bed.

1811
01:53:06,126 --> 01:53:07,611
- Has he been here?
- No.

1812
01:53:07,772 --> 01:53:09,531
- Have you seen him?
- Haven't seen him for a week.

1813
01:53:09,699 --> 01:53:11,821
- Where's Connell?
- He's watching the other door.

1814
01:53:11,986 --> 01:53:13,107
You're swell.

1815
01:53:18,449 --> 01:53:21,337
No sense going up. I been here
for hours. He ain't here.

1816
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:22,618
Let me go, will ya?

1817
01:53:27,119 --> 01:53:29,848
That's crazy. It's 14 floors.

1818
01:54:12,758 --> 01:54:16,044
It's as far as the elevator goes.
We walk up to the tower.

1819
01:55:07,869 --> 01:55:11,316
That tramp's probably full of
Christmas cheer in a flophouse.

1820
01:55:11,481 --> 01:55:13,524
I've got to decorate my tree.

1821
01:55:26,831 --> 01:55:28,233
Well, I give up.

1822
01:55:29,395 --> 01:55:31,435
I don't what gave us the idea

1823
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:33,479
he'd attempt anything like this.

1824
01:55:33,643 --> 01:55:34,315
I guess you're right.

1825
01:55:34,484 --> 01:55:36,158
I'm afraid the joke's on us.

1826
01:55:36,328 --> 01:55:39,245
I hope nobody
finds out we've been here.

1827
01:57:24,949 --> 01:57:26,989
I wouldn't do that, John.

1828
01:57:38,973 --> 01:57:40,488
It'll do you no good.

1829
01:57:41,618 --> 01:57:43,291
The Mayor has police downstairs

1830
01:57:43,982 --> 01:57:45,337
with instructions

1831
01:57:45,505 --> 01:57:48,306
to remove all identification
you may have on your person.

1832
01:57:49,791 --> 01:57:53,586
You'll be buried in Potter's Field.
You'll have accomplished nothing.

1833
01:58:04,417 --> 01:58:06,057
I've already taken care of that.

1834
01:58:07,661 --> 01:58:10,737
I mailed a copy
of this letter to Mr. Connell.

1835
01:58:13,832 --> 01:58:15,391
John, forget this foolishness.

1836
01:58:15,555 --> 01:58:19,440
Stop there, Mr. Norton,
if you don't want to go over too.

1837
01:58:24,288 --> 01:58:26,568
I'm glad you gentlemen are here.

1838
01:58:28,696 --> 01:58:31,169
You killed the
John Doe movement all right,

1839
01:58:32,101 --> 01:58:34,496
but you'll see it born again.

1840
01:58:42,158 --> 01:58:44,038
Take a good look, Mr. Norton.

1841
01:58:45,525 --> 01:58:46,480
John!

1842
01:58:47,247 --> 01:58:47,965
John!

1843
01:58:49,331 --> 01:58:52,134
John! Don't do it!

1844
01:58:52,296 --> 01:58:54,130
I love you, darling.

1845
01:58:54,299 --> 01:58:55,291
Please.

1846
01:58:56,542 --> 01:58:58,218
Please don't give up.

1847
01:58:58,386 --> 01:59:02,066
We'll start all over again.
Just you and I. It isn't too late.

1848
01:59:02,231 --> 01:59:04,546
The John Doe movement
isn't dead yet.

1849
01:59:05,518 --> 01:59:07,638
It isn't dead
or they wouldn't be here.

1850
01:59:08,122 --> 01:59:11,838
It's alive in them. They kept it
alive by being afraid of it.

1851
01:59:12,009 --> 01:59:13,650
That's why they came up here.

1852
01:59:13,971 --> 01:59:15,249
Oh, darling!

1853
01:59:16,336 --> 01:59:18,615
Sure it should have been killed.
It was dishonest.

1854
01:59:18,780 --> 01:59:21,459
But we can start clean now.
Just you and I.

1855
01:59:22,025 --> 01:59:24,146
It'll grow, John,

1856
01:59:24,311 --> 01:59:27,068
because it'll be
honest this time.

1857
01:59:27,796 --> 01:59:29,836
John, if it's worth dying for,

1858
01:59:29,998 --> 01:59:31,915
it's worth living for.

1859
01:59:32,643 --> 01:59:34,558
Please, John!

1860
01:59:37,693 --> 01:59:41,612
Please!
Please God, help me!

1861
01:59:44,344 --> 01:59:45,415
John!

1862
01:59:45,826 --> 01:59:46,943
John, look at me!

1863
01:59:47,669 --> 01:59:49,742
You want to be honest, don't you?

1864
01:59:49,913 --> 01:59:53,115
You don't have to die
to keep the John Doe idea alive.

1865
01:59:53,318 --> 01:59:56,635
Someone already died for that once.
The first John Doe.

1866
01:59:57,285 --> 02:00:00,042
And he's kept that idea
alive for nearly 2,000 years.

1867
02:00:00,530 --> 02:00:04,085
It was he who kept it alive
and he'll go on keeping it alive

1868
02:00:04,257 --> 02:00:05,293
forever and always.

1869
02:00:05,459 --> 02:00:09,059
For every John Doe movement
they kill, another will be born.

1870
02:00:09,386 --> 02:00:11,379
That's why those bells are ringing.

1871
02:00:11,908 --> 02:00:13,186
They're calling to us.

1872
02:00:13,393 --> 02:00:16,788
Not to give up, but keep on
fighting, keep on pitching.

1873
02:00:16,958 --> 02:00:18,234
Don't you see, darling?

1874
02:00:18,962 --> 02:00:21,036
This is no time to give up.

1875
02:00:21,405 --> 02:00:23,639
You and I John, we...

1876
02:00:24,812 --> 02:00:25,881
No!

1877
02:00:26,453 --> 02:00:29,415
No, John! If you die,
I want to die, too.

1878
02:00:31,422 --> 02:00:32,744
I love you!

1879
02:00:46,969 --> 02:00:49,771
Mr. Doe, you don't have to...

1880
02:00:51,177 --> 02:00:53,011
We're with you, Mr. Doe.

1881
02:00:53,178 --> 02:00:55,299
We just lost our heads
and acted like a mob.

1882
02:00:55,462 --> 02:00:58,985
What Bert's trying to say
is that we need you.

1883
02:00:59,270 --> 02:01:01,948
A lot of us didn't believe
what that man said.

1884
02:01:02,314 --> 02:01:05,870
We were going to start up our
Club again, with or without you.

1885
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:09,436
Weren't we, Bert?
A lot of others will do the same.

1886
02:01:09,607 --> 02:01:12,363
Mr. Sourpuss even got a letter
from his cousin in Toledo...

1887
02:01:12,531 --> 02:01:14,127
I got it right here, Mr. Doe.

1888
02:01:14,734 --> 02:01:17,733
Only, it'd be a lot easier
with you. Please...

1889
02:01:20,024 --> 02:01:22,258
Please come with us, Mr. Doe.

1890
02:01:47,630 --> 02:01:48,861
Long John!

1891
02:01:49,112 --> 02:01:50,342
Mr. Doe!

1892
02:01:50,795 --> 02:01:54,397
- We'll help. She'll be all right.
- Take her down to the car.

1893
02:01:57,807 --> 02:02:01,044
There you are, Norton.
The people! Try and lick that!
