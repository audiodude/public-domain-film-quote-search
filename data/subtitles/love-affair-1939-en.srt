00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,210
Flash! Michel Marnay,
the French heart crusher,

2
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,425
sailed incog tonight from Naples
onboard the Napoli. Why?

3
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,675
Because Lois Clarke
and her 20 million smackers

4
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,850
will be at the dock palpitating for him.

5
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,000
And it's good news for us mere men,
because when he arrives,

6
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,400
Michel Marnay goes out of circulation.

7
00:02:16,475 --> 00:02:18,250
This time, it's marriage.

8
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:22,860
Voici la nouvelle sensationnelle
qui va briser bien des coeurs.

9
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:29,050
Michel Marnay, le celebre sportsman, s'embarque ce soir. Oui!

10
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,675
Well, here we are,  ladies and gentlemen,

11
00:02:31,725 --> 00:02:35,380
and a nice, crisp little titbit has just come in.

12
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,050
Oh, by the way, I might mention,

13
00:02:37,075 --> 00:02:40,100
I'm speaking from dear old London as usual.

14
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,775
Well, it's rumoured that Michel Marnay sails for America tonight

15
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,870
to enter into matrimony, at last,

16
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,125
with one of America's industrial nobility,

17
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:57,325
a Miss...a Miss, uh, Lois Clarke.

18
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,560
The rock and gravel heiress.
Stone and sand, you know.

19
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,000
Hmm. Well, that seems to be all.
Goodnight.

20
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,050
Señor Marnay? No.

21
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,890
Señor Marnay!

22
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,730
- Señor Marnay?
- No. Is he onboard?

23
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,570
Yes. Señor Marnay!

24
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:34,075
Señor Marnay!

25
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:40,140
Señor Marnay!

26
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,780
Señor Marnay! Señor Marnay?

27
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:56,460
Mr Marnay, would you autograph
this picture of you? Please?

28
00:03:58,575 --> 00:04:02,430
Write something
we can always remember.

29
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,430
Something sizzling!

30
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,500
Thank you. It's in French! Isn't it
wonderful? I wonder what it means.

31
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:19,040
"You are very lovely girls,
but you have very bad manners."

32
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,630
Je vous demande pardon, madame. Je crois
que vous lisez mon télégramme.

33
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:49,400
- I beg your pardon?
- I said I believe you are reading my radiogram.

34
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,110
Oh.

35
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,910
Just a moment.

36
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:59,120
Well...how do I know it's yours?
Can you identify yourself?

37
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:04,520
Well... I am Michel Marnay.

38
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,725
Oh, don't tell me you're the fella?!

39
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,440
Yeah.

40
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,250
Well, this is... This is pretty personal.

41
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,730
Can you tell me what it says?

42
00:05:19,475 --> 00:05:23,450
Well, it says, "Remembering  a warm, beautiful night,

43
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,100
"a thunderstorm over Lake Como, and you."

44
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,410
And "you" - it's you?

45
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,100
It was all right, huh?

46
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,140
- Mm-hm.
- It was nice?

47
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,825
Thank you.

48
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,380
Do you think it'll ever take
the place of baseball?

49
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:27,360
What's the matter, did you lose it again?

50
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,960
Look...

51
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,925
I'm in trouble. Serious trouble.

52
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:36,000
I could've told you, playing around Lake Como. The poor thing.

53
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,575
No. I must talk to someone.

54
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,970
Well, I'm really not very good about
that sort of thing. I talk a lot.

55
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,600
- I've tried to break myself of the habit.
- You have an honest face.

56
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,450
- Oh, you...
- I can trust you, can't I?

57
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,175
- Yes, I guess so.
--Come with me.

58
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,325
But, look, the Captain has an honest
face, too. And the purser,

59
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:55,260
I thought he had a very honest...

60
00:07:00,025 --> 00:07:03,220
Shall we go to your cabin or mine?

61
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,725
Er...mine.

62
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:09,625
- Well, maybe mine is closer.
- Mine is here.

63
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,025
Oh.

64
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,575
Not that I'm prudish,
it's just that my mother told me

65
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:17,630
never to enter a man's room in any months ending in R.

66
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,625
Your mother must be a very beautiful woman.

67
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:25,450
- What's your name?
- Terry McKay.

68
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,330
Terry McKay.
And I'm travelling alone.

69
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:34,980
- That wasn't by any chance what was troubling you, was it?
- Yes.

70
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,180
Oh. Oh, this is fine.

71
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:42,150
- I thought you'd like it.
- You saved my life, you know.

72
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:45,900
I was bored to tears! I haven't seen
one attractive girl on this boat

73
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:49,060
since we left. Can you imagine?
Nine days like that?

74
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,220
No, this is terrible. That's not for me!

75
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,975
I should be bright, I should be beautiful and bubbling

76
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:56,175
like pink champagne. I got scared.

77
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,800
I said to myself, "Don't beautiful women travel any more?"

78
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:06,000
Evidently not. Then I saw you
and it was all right. I was saved. I hope. Cigarette?

79
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,700
No, thank you.

80
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,725
Have you been getting results with a line like that?

81
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:17,420
- Or would I be surprised?
- If YOU were surprised that would surprise me.

82
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,260
That sounds like a nasty crack.

83
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,375
I could make a few, too, if I felt like it.

84
00:08:21,475 --> 00:08:24,980
- I'm sure you could.    - I know I can.
- That's what I said.    - I think I will.

85
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,220
How's your fiancee?

86
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,150
She's got a cold.

87
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,340
Oh, that's too bad.

88
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,470
- Got it at Lake Como?
- No. No, she wasn't there.

89
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:40,590
Oh. Oh, you mean the Lady of the Lake was not...

90
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,630
That was her best friend.

91
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,390
Oh.

92
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,560
- A chummy bunch.
- Yeah.

93
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,640
Oh, this boat is going awfully fast.

94
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,840
Only eight and a half days till we get in.

95
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,440
Is there any reason why, from now on,
it shouldn't be pink champagne?

96
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,650
Hmm.

97
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,210
Don't tell me he's the fellow?

98
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,650
Uh-huh.

99
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,810
- He's all right, eh?
- Uh-huh.

100
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,130
- He's nice?
- Uh-huh.

101
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,180
- Where is he now?
- Well, he's visiting his parents.

102
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,580
He sends me on a buying trip every once in a...

103
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,020
You see, he's my boss too.

104
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,460
Oh.

105
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,225
- You don't think he would approve of pink champagne?
- Oh, no, I don't...

106
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,925
Well, I think it's very touching, you and him.

107
00:09:55,075 --> 00:09:58,325
- Very beautiful. I like that.
- Oh, good.

108
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:02,000
He must be a very fascinating fellow.

109
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:04,900
Well, you can just imagine how attractive he is,

110
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,030
when I can resist so charming a person as you.

111
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,840
Yes. I think I'll go now.

112
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:18,700
After all, I still have deck tennis  and...keno,

113
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,900
and there is always shuffleboard.

114
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:25,475
- Don't tell me you're embarrassed?
- Oh, yes. Yes, I am.

115
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:28,775
So if you don't mind, I think I'll take my pride for a walk.

116
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,425
- Unless, by chance, you'd care to have dinner.
- Oh, I'd love that.

117
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:34,810
Oh, that would be very nice.

118
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,890
Instead of Mother Goose, you were
probably brought up on the memoirs of Casanova

119
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,610
- Not at all.
- Hmm.

120
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,490
But you've heard of the little fella, haven't you?

121
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,450
I imagine you've known quite a few women, haven't you?

122
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:55,060
Or maybe "few" is the wrong word.

123
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,460
And I gather you haven't very much
respect for them?

124
00:11:01,775 --> 00:11:04,625
But you've always been very fair
in your judgments.

125
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,750
I beg your pardon, señor, would you like me

126
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:10,150
to reserve this table
for you every night?

127
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,310
Why not?

128
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:17,070
- You know, I...
- Now, look, look, let's talk about you now.

129
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,275
Oh, no, not tonight. Let's talk about me some other night.

130
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,350
All right.

131
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,320
Señor Marnay.

132
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,680
- Another one.
- And YOUR name, please?     - McKay.

133
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,480
Ah! Hmm.

134
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,210
Where were we? Hmm.

135
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,925
Oh, yes. What's the name
of that strange place you came from?

136
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,950
Kansas.

137
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,890
And from there?

138
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,775
Well, then I went to New York
and got a job singing in a nightclub

139
00:12:09,825 --> 00:12:11,075
from ten to three in the morning,

140
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,725
and then the manager used to chase me
around his office until about four,

141
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:20,700
and then I went home. And then one night, HE came along.
- Oh, yes.

142
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,740
Yeah. He said I didn't belong in a place like that.

143
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,300
He said that, um...

144
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,800
Hmm?

145
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,575
- I didn't say anything.
- Oh. Well, he said that...

146
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,350
- That you could improve yourself?
- Yeah. So I studied hard.

147
00:12:37,575 --> 00:12:40,000
So that someday you would be
a charming and lovely wife.

148
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,430
Yeah, that was the idea, more or...
Is there anything wrong with that?

149
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,850
- Oh, no, no.
- Well, that's what I thought. But nothing happened.

150
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,520
Well, that just about brings us up-to-date.

151
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,960
Now my life's an open book.

152
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:56,720
It's only one page.

153
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,880
It's the only page.

154
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,600
I beg your pardon.

155
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,425
Thank you very much.

156
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:12,850
- Oh, that's bad. Hmm?
- Oh.

157
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,330
- That's a beautiful camera you've got there.
- Oh, yes.

158
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:18,425
- It takes very clear pictures.
- Oh, please, monsieur!

159
00:13:18,425 --> 00:13:20,530
Oh.

160
00:13:27,575 --> 00:13:30,350
I guess it isn't any good for either one of us to be seen together.

161
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:33,340
Right or wrong, you know, people like to talk.

162
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,550
- It better be goodbye.
- What's the matter? Afraid?        - Of you? No.

163
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,125
Well, after all, we're on the same ship.

164
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,700
Still have eight days, you know?

165
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,075
Well, you can take nice, long walks out in the sunshine.

166
00:13:44,175 --> 00:13:46,030
What should I do if it rains?

167
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,750
- Nah, it's no good.
- I see.

168
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,650
- It's particularly no good for you.
- Yes, that's right.

169
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,075
Being seen with you is news

170
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,450
and I don't want to get my picture in the paper, so...

171
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,830
I think we better spread out.

172
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,150
Hey! Hey, get me down from here, will ya?

173
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,240
I got up there and I couldn't get back.

174
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,040
- Can you do that?
-  Sure.

175
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,650
- Good. You're quite a fellow.
- Hey! You must be quite a guy yourself.

176
00:14:28,825 --> 00:14:32,530
--Yes? Why?
- Well, everybody on the ship's talking about ya.         -No.

177
00:14:32,675 --> 00:14:34,775
- What do they say about me?
- Well, I don't know.

178
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,475
Every time they start talking about
you, they make me leave the room.

179
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,210
Is that so?

180
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:55,140
Oh ! Be careful there, sonny.
You'll fall and hurt yourself!

181
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:59,060
- When I was little like you, I fell and broke my leg!
- How is it now?

182
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,275
- Well, it's all right.
- So what are you crabbing about?

183
00:15:02,325 --> 00:15:07,590
Well, I'm not crabbing, I... just thought that you...

184
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,230
I'm sorry.

185
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,150
- Give me a champagne cocktail, will you?        - Yes, sir.
- Got cigarettes?

186
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,000
--At the cigarette dispenser.   Pink champagne?
- Yes.

187
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,520
- Champagne cocktail, please.
- Yes, madam.

188
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,440
- Have you any pink champagne?
- Yes.

189
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:25,430
- I changed my table to a table for one.
- So did I.

190
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,225
Yeah, it's too bad it had to be like that.

191
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,825
We had such a delightful dinner last night.

192
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,350
Parlez-vous inkpay appulay?

193
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,100
What did you say?

194
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,230
Oh...

195
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:20,875
There's no-one that's fooling the world...
Everybody's watching us.

196
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,750
This is awful!

197
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:28,575
I think this is awful  and I'm going to go.

198
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,240
Don't you go too!

199
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,200
Hello! Going my way?

200
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:11,260
- Calling on a lady.                      -  Even in Madeira?
- No, you're wrong this time.

201
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,275
- My grandmother.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

202
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,000
That's all right. She lives up on the hill.

203
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:20,400
- Would you like to meet her?
- Yes, I'd be very happy to.       Come on, get in.

204
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,110
Oh, what a divine place!

205
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:46,680
- Oh, I want to meet her.
-  Yes?    Just a minute, I'll see if she's there.

206
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,720
Hello? Hello?

207
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,775
She's not there.

208
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:02,090
Oh...look.

209
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,730
She must be in the chapel.

210
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:12,300
Hello, Jackie.
You still remember me?

211
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,340
What is it about this place?

212
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,780
Something makes you feel
you ought to whisper.

213
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,980
Such peace!

214
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,430
- It's like another world.
- My grandmother's world.

215
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,390
Tell me a little more about her.

216
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,925
My grandfather was in the diplomatic service,

217
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,975
they lived all over the world.

218
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:52,230
This was his last post.
He died here.

219
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,950
So she stayed on to be near him.

220
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,825
He's buried there
in the other chapel.

221
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,360
She must be waiting,
I think a little impatiently,

222
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,000
for the day she will join him.

223
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:13,950
Michel! Mon... Mon cheri!

224
00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:52,560
Oh, no. No, no.
May I present Miss Terry McKay.

225
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,825
She thought you were the girl
I'm going to marry.

226
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,120
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

227
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,920
Elle est charmante.
Elle me plait beaucoup.

228
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:04,450
Pardon. I was only saying I liked
you very much.

229
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,150
Oh, thank you. I'm glad.

230
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,850
If you'll excuse me, I'll sit down
for a moment. Oh, pardon.

231
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,350
I'm longer with my prayers these days.

232
00:21:13,425 --> 00:21:18,580
And my knees,
well, they are as old as I am.

233
00:21:20,475 --> 00:21:24,530
- Are you English?
- No, I'm an American.        - American!

234
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,025
Do you know, my dear, I have
a special fondness for America.

235
00:21:29,225 --> 00:21:33,325
- It was my husband's first post after we married.
- Really?

236
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:38,630
In fact, we went to Washington on our honeymoon.

237
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,770
- You have a lovely place here.
--Thank you.

238
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,225
I'd like to stay on for ever.

239
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,175
You are too young for that.

240
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,175
It's a good place to sit and remember,

241
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:56,150
but you still have to create
your memories.

242
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,040
- Would you like to go inside the chapel?
- May I?

243
00:22:03,725 --> 00:22:07,360
How long has it been for you,
Michel?

244
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,360
Oh, let's see...

245
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,960
Since you were an altar boy.

246
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,725
- Yes.
-Then you better go in, too.

247
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,970
- It won't hurt you.     - I know.
- I'll prepare tea.    - Good.

248
00:24:05,175 --> 00:24:08,100
I've never seen such lovely colours.
Uh-huh.

249
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,500
- Everything's so vivid.
- Yes.

250
00:24:10,975 --> 00:24:12,660
Even the green seems greener.

251
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,830
Yes, they...they get a lot of rainfall here.

252
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:25,150
- Who takes care of this place?
- Hmm?  Oh, an old gardener. There he is!

253
00:24:25,225 --> 00:24:28,910
- Michel! On est content de vous voir, vous savez
- Toi aussi, mon vieux.

254
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:33,075
-  Petite nouvelle?    - Oui Monsieur, la dernière.
- Combien en as-tu eu depuis que je ne t'ai pas vu?

255
00:24:33,075 --> 00:24:36,920
- Trois.       - Oh. He's got three children since I have seen him.
Well!

256
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,680
Emile says, "France needs men!"
So he has seven daughters.

257
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,120
Seven?!

258
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,640
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I think I'll go see the rest of the family.

259
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,400
- Dans la maison, monsieur.
- Dans la maison? Oh! Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça? Tu n'as que des filles?

260
00:24:51,725 --> 00:24:55,690
- Tea will be ready any moment.
- May I help you?    - Thank you, my dear.

261
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:02,290
- Oh. Where are your cups?        - In there.

262
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,340
- I have it.      - Oh, thank you.

263
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:25,000
I'm sorry, I had to let my maid go.
I have to watch my expenses.

264
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:31,580
You see, I planned on dying when I was 75,
and here I am 77.

265
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:36,510
So, if I am not going to die,
I have to start saving my money.

266
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:47,270
- You like it?
- Yes, it's charming. Who did that?

267
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,670
- Michel.     --Michel?!

268
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,320
He painted it for me.

269
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,280
Why, it's good!

270
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,080
- He is very talented.
- Oh, forgive me.

271
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,840
You see, I wouldn't have any way of knowing.

272
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,680
Unfortunately, he is also very critical.

273
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:13,200
- As a result, he hasn't done anything since.
- What a pity.

274
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:20,890
- Besides, Michel is too busy...
- Living?      --Yes. Thank you.

275
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,210
Things come too easy to him

276
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:27,570
and he's always allured by the art he is not practising,

277
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:31,825
the places he hasn't been, the girl he hasn't met.

278
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,460
I don't mind confessing to you, my dear,

279
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,780
that I've been worried about him.

280
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:43,900
- Why?
- That one day life will present a bill to Michel

281
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,180
and that he will find it hard to pay.

282
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:55,830
But when I see him with you,
I feel better.

283
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,990
Well, I don't understand.

284
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,390
He's going to be married and settle down.

285
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:08,390
- Can't you just see him with his slippers and his pipe?
- No.

286
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,600
There is many a slip betwixt the lip and the water

287
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,240
and anything could happen on a boat.

288
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,150
Believe me, my dear, there is nothing wrong with Michel

289
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:27,440
that a good woman could not make right.

290
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:37,410
Well, I saw Emile's entire family.
Seven daughters.

291
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:40,450
I congratulated him and I had
a nice talk with his wife.

292
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,890
- How have you two girls been getting along?
- You'd be surprised.

293
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,850
I bet she did all the talking.
Uh-huh.

294
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:48,266
She told me that when you were a little boy,

295
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:49,773
if you didn't get your own way,

296
00:27:49,786 --> 00:27:53,800
you used to lie on the floor and kick and get red in the face.

297
00:27:54,613 --> 00:27:59,420
- And what did YOU say?
- Well, I said you didn't do that any more.

298
00:27:59,693 --> 00:28:03,060
Now if you don't get your own way,
you just get embarrassed.

299
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,980
Hmm.

300
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,110
What have you two been discussing?

301
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,150
Seems a lot has been going on
that I know nothing about!

302
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:31,190
- Well, I'm afraid we must be going.
- Michel!

303
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,880
See? Janou, you must play the piano
for us before we go.

304
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,880
Oh, no. - She was a great pianist, you know?
- Oh, come on.

305
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:44,946
She's going to play here right now.

306
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,320
Ah! But, Michel, look at my hands.

307
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,250
Right.

308
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,130
That's right.

309
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:59,730
Remember, I was asked to do this.

♪ J'ai tout quitté pour l'ingrate Sylvie

314
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,973
I don't like boat whistles.

315
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,226
I know.

316
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,053
- Here. Better have this round you.
- Thank you

317
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,973
- Isn't it beautiful.
- You like it?

318
00:32:03,066 --> 00:32:07,146
- I do.      - I'll send it to you...someday.

319
00:32:09,866 --> 00:32:13,050
This is as far as I can go.

320
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:16,450
This is the boundary of my small world.

321
00:32:16,986 --> 00:32:19,140
It's a perfect world.

322
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,420
Thank you for letting me trespass.

323
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,860
Bye. God bless you.

324
00:32:26,866 --> 00:32:32,680
Well, Janou, I'll come back to see
you very soon. Really, I will.

325
00:32:32,746 --> 00:32:36,573
And I shall write very often,   you'll see.

326
00:32:36,626 --> 00:32:38,950
Please do!

327
00:32:45,653 --> 00:32:47,190
Goodbye.

328
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,280
Bye.

329
00:33:11,586 --> 00:33:13,520
Bye, Janou.

330
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,340
Oooh!

331
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,200
- Looks like stormy weather ahead.
- We've changed our course today.

332
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:49,666
I want to thank you for a lovely evening.

333
00:33:49,973 --> 00:33:51,720
I want to thank you

334
00:33:51,773 --> 00:33:55,666
for what was undoubtedly the loveliest day I've ever known.

335
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:58,373
You've been very sweet to my little grandmother.

336
00:33:58,426 --> 00:34:01,830
- I'm going to write to her.
- That would be nice.

337
00:34:04,386 --> 00:34:05,870
Well...goodnight.

338
00:34:06,373 --> 00:34:07,733
Goodnight.

339
00:34:30,253 --> 00:34:32,520
We're heading into a rough sea, Michel.

340
00:34:35,946 --> 00:34:37,373
Goodnight.

341
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:40,226
Goodnight.

342
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,100
If you say, "A penny for your thoughts," I'll jump overboard!

343
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:25,900
- I thought you'd gone to bed.
- What good would that do? I can't sleep.

344
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:30,460
Yes, I know.
All I seem to do is turn and toss.

345
00:35:31,386 --> 00:35:35,386
- Dreaming?
-  I wouldn't call that dreaming, I'm awake.

346
00:35:35,573 --> 00:35:37,550
I'd call it wishing.

347
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,510
My father used to say,

348
00:35:40,826 --> 00:35:43,973
"Wishes are the dreams we dream
when we're awake."

349
00:35:44,106 --> 00:35:46,630
- Your father said that?
- He drank a lot.

350
00:35:49,226 --> 00:35:52,440
I wrote a song once...about wishing.

351
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,480
Was nice.

352
00:35:55,493 --> 00:36:00,240
- Oh, it was?
- No, I didn't mean that. I mean, it was...

353
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,613
You mean it was not bad.

354
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:07,400
You know, one day I'm going to learn
your language and be very funny too.

355
00:36:08,226 --> 00:36:11,053
I'm sorry. How does it go?

356
00:36:11,106 --> 00:36:12,840
Hmm?

357
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,986
Oh, I forget.

358
00:36:15,026 --> 00:36:20,370
But it meant...if you wish very hard with your mind,

359
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:24,066
and if you wish very strong in your heart,

360
00:36:24,146 --> 00:36:27,810
and if you keep on wishing long enough and strong enough...

361
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,340
- You get what you want for Christmas?
--Yes.

362
00:36:39,293 --> 00:36:41,100
Well...we get in in the morning.

363
00:36:41,786 --> 00:36:42,620
Uh-huh.

364
00:36:44,346 --> 00:36:45,860
Will he be...waiting?

365
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,630
- Hmm. And she?
- Mm-hm.

366
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,750
Mm-hm.

367
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,710
I suppose if we have something in our minds,
we better say it now.

368
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,390
Yes.

369
00:37:07,866 --> 00:37:11,773
You know, I've never worked in all my life.

370
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,380
In all my life, I've never worked.

371
00:37:15,013 --> 00:37:17,380
I've been thinking about that.

372
00:37:23,933 --> 00:37:28,400
- What did you say?
- Hmm? I didn't say anything.     - You did, too.

373
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:33,690
You said I was very fond of expensive things.
Furs and jewels and things.

374
00:37:34,093 --> 00:37:36,170
Did I say that?

375
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,826
I guess you and I have been more or less

376
00:37:40,853 --> 00:37:43,546
used to a life of pink champagne.

377
00:37:44,986 --> 00:37:47,770
- Maybe it'd be a little difficult to...
- Hmm?

378
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:52,820
- You like beer?
- Yes, I do, but...

379
00:37:53,026 --> 00:37:56,860
I know, it's bad for the figure.

380
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,200
My father used to say,
"It's a funny thing, but the things we like best

381
00:38:03,586 --> 00:38:07,760
"are either illegal, immoral or fattening."

382
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,110
I told you he drank like a fish.

383
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,333
I wonder what your father would think of me?

384
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,573
Never working. Not once!

385
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,626
Well, just because you haven't...

386
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,080
Oh, I didn't mean that I couldn't, of course not.

387
00:38:32,146 --> 00:38:35,640
But, I couldn't find out all at once.

388
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:42,440
- It would take me, oh, at least six months to find out if...
- If what?

389
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,746
Well, it's hard to say.

390
00:38:43,853 --> 00:38:46,853
I'm sorry, it's unfair to ask you to take a chance.

391
00:38:47,026 --> 00:38:51,440
But...if I work hard enough, and long enough,

392
00:38:51,546 --> 00:38:55,533
and if wishes came true, where would you be?

393
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,920
What are you trying to say, Michel?

394
00:38:58,013 --> 00:39:02,533
I'm trying to say that it would take me six months to find out

395
00:39:02,626 --> 00:39:05,790
if I'm worthy to say what's in my heart.

396
00:39:08,506 --> 00:39:12,200
Oh, that's just about the nicest thing.

397
00:39:14,733 --> 00:39:19,720
I think I'll turn in.
Do a little more rolling and tossing.

398
00:39:21,306 --> 00:39:24,320
I'll think it over and let you know in the morning.

399
00:39:26,506 --> 00:39:30,730
- Going my way?
- No, I think I'll... I'll walk a little.

400
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:41,330
- Marriage is a very serious step for a girl like me.
- Yes, I know.

401
00:39:43,053 --> 00:39:46,080
- Do you like children?
- Oh, yes, I do!

402
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,613
I was so worried, I was wondering...

403
00:40:00,626 --> 00:40:03,560
I'm sorry, I didn't even know
we were in! I'm only half dressed.

404
00:40:05,613 --> 00:40:09,710
If...if everything turns out
all right, for both of us, I mean,

405
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,230
- in six months...
- Yes?

406
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,506
- That's July.
- July, yes.

407
00:40:13,813 --> 00:40:15,910
I've written out these directions.

408
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,310
Read them carefully
so there won't be any mistake.

409
00:40:19,786 --> 00:40:22,670
- "Darling..." That's me?
- Uh-huh.

410
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,590
"July 1st, five o'clock,

411
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,586
"102nd floor,
top of the Empire State Building."

412
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,920
Yes. That's it right there.

413
00:40:34,253 --> 00:40:37,840
- It's the tallest building in the world, you can't miss that.
- No.

414
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,320
It's the nearest thing to heaven
that we have in New York.

415
00:40:43,013 --> 00:40:45,920
Be sure you take the elevator.

416
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:49,810
Well...until we...meet again.

417
00:40:50,893 --> 00:40:52,653
Take care of yourself.

418
00:42:10,493 --> 00:42:12,693
- Michael!
- So glad to see you.

419
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,290
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

420
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,810
- Did you have a nice crossing?
- Yes, I had a very nice crossing.

421
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:18,890
Miss Clarke, would you pose for a still, please?

422
00:42:20,613 --> 00:42:22,853
Yes. Thank you. One more, please.

423
00:42:22,866 --> 00:42:26,466
Oh...yes. That's it. That's fine.

424
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,940
Now, just one more, Miss Clarke, please?

425
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,420
One more.

426
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,140
Will this do? Oh, that's fine, that's fine, Miss Clarke.

427
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:36,986
- Thank you.
- I'm in a hurry. If you'll excuse me, I have an appointment.

428
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:39,506
Just one more.

429
00:42:39,533 --> 00:42:42,826
Michael, I'm so glad you're back.
One more! No, no more!

430
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,850
Just say something.

431
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,653
Let me look at you. Oh, it's
wonderful to have you back.

432
00:42:49,653 --> 00:42:50,506
Was it a rough crossing?

433
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,773
Well, you wouldn't exactly call it
smooth, we...

434
00:42:52,786 --> 00:42:55,560
- I beg your pardon.
- Oh, excuse us.

435
00:42:55,586 --> 00:42:57,613
Terry, darling,
it's great to have you back.

436
00:42:57,626 --> 00:43:00,070
It's great to be back, Ken.

437
00:43:54,733 --> 00:43:57,860
Your trunk's arrived. Where's the keys?

438
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,700
Don't unpack, Annie.

439
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,280
I'm moving.

440
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,093
- Well, lots of good luck.
- Thanks.

441
00:44:22,133 --> 00:44:23,946
I hope you'll be working here.

442
00:44:23,946 --> 00:44:26,720
The terms are satisfactory, but as I said before...

443
00:44:26,733 --> 00:44:30,280
- I know, it's not up to you, it's up to the customer.
- That's right.

444
00:44:30,306 --> 00:44:32,680
You sing, then we'll talk.

445
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,720
- And if I can't find you, I'll understand.
- That's right!

Well, no matter what you say,
I'm not going to pay you a cent more.

Oh! Who wants more money? I am so happy you are here.

487
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:38,640
You're always happy. What's the secret?

488
00:48:39,746 --> 00:48:42,290
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

489
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:45,413
My place is half empty, I have rheumatism,

490
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,840
and my husband left me with five children

491
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,350
and they are all ashamed of me!

492
00:48:54,773 --> 00:48:59,653
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, you shouldn't be
sorry, you should be happy.

493
00:48:59,693 --> 00:49:03,360
There is no boyfriends calling on you, so you don't get married.

494
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:08,813
And if you don't get married, your children won't be ashamed of you!

495
00:49:09,173 --> 00:49:12,160
Well, goodnight. And don't you read late, it's bad for your eyes.

496
00:49:12,253 --> 00:49:14,720
Goodnight. I'm not going to worry about anything.

497
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:17,773
Oh, you know, I joke a lot about marriage,

498
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,746
but it can be a beautiful thing.

499
00:49:19,786 --> 00:49:23,400
You know, you should get married if you find the right man, of course.

500
00:49:23,413 --> 00:49:25,506
I don't know where you will find him, of course,

501
00:49:25,586 --> 00:49:28,146
but don't you marry a loafer like I did.

502
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:31,146
It's just as easy to marry a man with lots of money.

503
00:49:31,173 --> 00:49:32,706
Maybe you don't love him at first,

504
00:49:32,746 --> 00:49:35,946
but you can teach yourself in six easy lessons.

505
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:40,540
Just don't you marry a loafer.
I married one, he was a prize winner.

506
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,210
Yep...

507
00:50:00,573 --> 00:50:02,330
I was hoping you would like one of...

508
00:50:04,613 --> 00:50:08,186
Well, I suppose if I can't sell my paintings, I'll get a job.

509
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,906
Oh, I wouldn't give up painting. Why, painting...

510
00:50:10,933 --> 00:50:13,450
I'm not going to give it up.
This is the only thing I know.

511
00:50:13,813 --> 00:50:16,533
- But I've got to make money. A lot of money.
- Of course, of course.

512
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,340
In order to make money, you must eat.

513
00:50:19,506 --> 00:50:22,260
Even the new money gets hungry, you know?

514
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:42,690
Michel. Michel!

515
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:46,270
Oh.

516
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:49,750
- I have good news for you!
- What?

517
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:52,590
- I've sold one.
- Which one?

518
00:50:53,813 --> 00:50:57,920
The woman.
I got a hundred dollars for her!

519
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:20,280
- What are you so happy about?
- I'm a painter!         - So am I.

520
00:51:20,386 --> 00:51:23,370
But I ain't happy!

521
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:50,386
Miss McKay, my dear. My favourite customer.

522
00:51:50,413 --> 00:51:53,880
- Welcome home.
- Thank you.         - How well you're looking.

523
00:51:53,906 --> 00:51:56,310
Yes, I know. I didn't get it here.

524
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:57,600
Where have you been
all these months?

525
00:51:57,626 --> 00:51:59,720
- Out of town.
- Oh, my dear, we've missed you.

526
00:51:59,746 --> 00:52:02,453
- Well, I've missed you, too, Miss...
- Lane.

527
00:52:02,493 --> 00:52:06,310
Miss Lane, I want to get something so beautiful...

528
00:52:06,586 --> 00:52:08,813
simple, you understand, but breathtaking.

529
00:52:08,853 --> 00:52:13,270
- Oh, of course! Miss Web, look who's back.
- Oh, Miss McKay!

530
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,080
We were just saying, "Whatever
happened to Miss McKay?"

531
00:52:16,093 --> 00:52:18,026
And here you are. Isn't it wonderful!

532
00:52:18,053 --> 00:52:22,280
Miss McKay is here and we were just wondering...

533
00:52:22,453 --> 00:52:26,653
Miss McKay is there? Well, give her anything in the shop,

534
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:28,240
but hold her till I get there, will ya?

535
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,400
You weren't worried about her credit, were you? Yes.

536
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:36,333
Yes, that's what we were wondering.
I knew you'd understand, Mr Bradley.

537
00:52:36,946 --> 00:52:38,890
Thank you so much.

538
00:52:42,146 --> 00:52:45,466
Hmm. I don't think you could make a mistake on either one.

539
00:52:47,306 --> 00:52:48,890
Oh...excuse me, please.

540
00:52:49,306 --> 00:52:52,506
Where shall we have this sent?
Well, I don't know at the moment.

541
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,946
I'll have to call back and let you know.

542
00:52:53,973 --> 00:52:57,333
- I think that's right, isn't it?
- No...no charge?

543
00:52:57,346 --> 00:53:00,813
No, no. No? I know, I know.

544
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,740
No. No, no.

545
00:53:04,373 --> 00:53:06,573
Oh. Goodbye, Miss McKay.
Goodbye, Miss McKay.

546
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,733
Do come back again soon.
Yes, don't stay away so long, my dear.

547
00:53:09,746 --> 00:53:12,733
Thank you. Goodbye.
Goodbye, Miss McKay.

548
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:15,990
- Terry.
-  Ken! What are you doing here?

549
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:19,120
How on Earth did YOU know I was here?

550
00:53:19,213 --> 00:53:24,750
- Oh. Oh, I see. What time is it, Ken? I'm late.
- Five minutes to five.

551
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:26,946
- It's good to see you, Ken.
- It's wonderful to see you again.

552
00:53:26,946 --> 00:53:28,853
I've got so much to talk about.
Can't we go...?

553
00:53:28,893 --> 00:53:31,693
- Oh, no, I'm in a hurry.
- But I've got so much to say.

554
00:53:31,706 --> 00:53:33,640
Well, call me up sometime.

555
00:53:33,826 --> 00:53:36,080
No, you can't do that, either,
when I'm going to be married.

556
00:53:36,106 --> 00:53:37,560
Oh, then, you are going to...

557
00:53:37,613 --> 00:53:40,146
Yes, Ken and I'm late.
What time did you say it was?

558
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,146
Four minutes to five. It looks like
I came all the way down here

559
00:53:43,173 --> 00:53:44,253
just to tell you what time it was.

560
00:53:44,253 --> 00:53:48,013
- Yes. Goodbye, Ken.
- Goodbye.

561
00:53:48,733 --> 00:53:52,410
- Good luck!
- Thanks, Ken.

562
00:53:52,453 --> 00:53:54,253
You can imagine how excited I am,

563
00:53:54,253 --> 00:53:57,730
I thought 34th Street was that way and it's down here!

564
00:53:59,893 --> 00:54:02,290
I'll get out here, I'm in a hurry.

565
00:54:04,146 --> 00:54:07,410
- Here you are.
- What's the rush?

566
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,440
I'm going to be married

567
00:54:08,466 --> 00:54:10,986
and I'd like you to be the first to congratulate me.

568
00:54:11,013 --> 00:54:13,586
Thank you so much.

569
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,980
- Going down?
- No.

570
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,360
- Going down?
- No.

571
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:32,760
- What time have you got?
- Ten after five.

572
00:56:08,826 --> 00:56:10,140
Going down?

573
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:12,980
Yeah.

574
00:56:34,653 --> 00:56:36,730
Doctor...

575
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:43,160
What do you think?

576
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,253
Her X-rays aren't very encouraging.

577
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,210
It's hard to say if she'll ever walk again.

578
00:56:48,666 --> 00:56:51,680
We can tell better in about six months.

579
00:56:51,853 --> 00:56:55,146
Are you the fellow she was yelling about under the anaesthetic?

580
00:56:55,866 --> 00:57:01,040
Er...no, no. That's another chap.
She was on her way to marry him.

581
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:06,440
- Has he been notified?
- No. She...she doesn't want that, because...

582
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:10,000
until she knows what you say you won't know for six months,

583
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,920
she'd rather he didn't know.

584
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:19,430
- That's being sensible. Nice girl.
- I think so. Excuse me.

585
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:32,240
Well, we weren't sure whether or not
we'd have you with us today.

586
00:57:34,946 --> 00:57:38,800
Father, this is the man...

587
00:57:39,466 --> 00:57:42,440
He and I... Yes, he explained.

588
00:57:42,586 --> 00:57:47,370
Then you know...
I was on my way to be married.

589
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:52,850
But while I was on my way to be...a good girl...

590
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:57,530
..I got hit right in the intersection of 34th and 5th.

591
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:04,850
Wasn't anybody's fault but my own.

592
00:58:06,346 --> 00:58:10,020
I had an appointment...way up.

593
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:14,260
I didn't want to keep him waiting.

594
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,180
Oh, it could've been beautiful.

595
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,540
Marriage, I mean. Children.

596
00:58:37,746 --> 00:58:40,990
Forgive me, Father. I'm a little weak.

597
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,150
I don't get a lot of exercise.

598
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,980
Janou?

599
00:59:31,253 --> 00:59:33,100
Janou?

600
00:59:39,253 --> 00:59:41,780
Janou?

601
01:00:46,066 --> 01:00:50,060
Monsieur Michel,
she gave me this to send to you.

602
01:00:50,533 --> 01:00:52,740
I was going to mail it today.

603
01:00:53,933 --> 01:00:57,700
She said it was for the young lady that was here with you.

604
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,960
Hello, Miss McKay. Oh, hello.

605
01:02:10,266 --> 01:02:13,506
How are you feeling? I'm all right.
How are you? Fine. Fine.

606
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,826
How are you, Patsy Jane? Fine.

607
01:02:15,906 --> 01:02:18,266
She's got on
a red flannel petticoat. Don't!

608
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:22,920
Aw! Well, it's warmer!
I'll bet it is.

609
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,533
Been practising your song? Uh-huh.

610
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:29,280
Know your parts today? Sure.
I knew mine yesterday. Is that so?!

611
01:02:30,906 --> 01:02:34,720
Oh, come on, come on. Let's try it.
I've been practising, too.

612
01:02:35,413 --> 01:02:36,560
Wait till you hear me.

613
01:02:36,906 --> 01:02:38,466
One, two...

631
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,720
How long this is going on?

632
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,106
Only a few days

633
01:04:18,106 --> 01:04:20,866
- I hope you're not angry.
- Oh, no, no.

634
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,320
But when you have as many youngsters
on your hands as I have,

635
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,480
you have a problem.

636
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,600
Oh, I don't know. I like them.

637
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:33,610
I do, too. But they don't like me.

638
01:04:34,306 --> 01:04:35,890
They call me Picklepuss.

639
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:42,146
At heart, they're just little savages.

640
01:04:42,293 --> 01:04:45,613
But music, you know, has charms
to soothe the savage breast.

641
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,146
And if it has such an influence,

642
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:51,780
and if you can do so much in a few days, I'm thinking...

643
01:04:53,453 --> 01:04:55,700
I wonder if you're thinking the same thing I am?

644
01:04:56,600 --> 01:05:00,533
Music has charms and I like children and children like me. And...

645
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:04,340
I'll be getting out of here pretty soon.

646
01:05:06,493 --> 01:05:10,470
When I do, I'll be needing a job badly.

647
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:13,400
- It will be only an experiment, you understand?
- Yes, I know.

648
01:05:13,506 --> 01:05:16,990
- We can't pay a high...
- Oh, I know. I know.

649
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:19,706
Just say you'll pay me enough that...

650
01:05:20,133 --> 01:05:23,230
I don't go around calling you Picklepuss.

651
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:24,910
Yes.

652
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,293
I'd like to give them a surprise.

653
01:05:31,333 --> 01:05:33,333
So if you don't say anything, I won't say anything.

654
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:38,120
- I won't say a word.
- We won't tell anybody either!

655
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:57,973
I must say, you've become
a better painter, my friend.

656
01:05:57,986 --> 01:06:00,800
Maybe you'll become a better critic.

657
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:02,733
Six months of hard work.

658
01:06:02,733 --> 01:06:05,760
Well, I'm glad you haven't wasted your time, my friend.

659
01:06:05,853 --> 01:06:08,450
I've sold everything but this.

660
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:11,386
I told them to take it out of the window since you telephoned me.

661
01:06:11,386 --> 01:06:13,720
- Oh, thanks.
- This is the best, I think.

662
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:17,453
Yes, I'm not exactly ashamed of it, myself.

663
01:06:17,626 --> 01:06:21,333
- You don't want to sell it, eh?
- No, I don't want to sell it.

664
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,640
I wouldn't mind getting rid of it,
but somehow I don't want to...

665
01:06:24,693 --> 01:06:26,840
take money for it. Oh.

666
01:06:26,893 --> 01:06:30,946
I thought maybe you were keeping it
because...you were...

667
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:33,200
you were nursing a broken heart, eh?

668
01:06:35,573 --> 01:06:38,790
No. No, a broken heart is not for me.

669
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:43,030
Life is what you make it.

670
01:06:43,426 --> 01:06:46,430
From now on, I'm taking my fun where I find it.

671
01:06:47,506 --> 01:06:50,640
Oh, well, I'll be seeing you soon again. Bye.

672
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:55,413
- Merry Christmas.
-  Merry Christmas to you, my friend.

673
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:08,210
Michael! I heard you were in town.

674
01:07:08,210 --> 01:07:11,186
I've had a terrible time
running you down.

675
01:07:11,253 --> 01:07:14,280
Ah, you've been gone a long time, mon ami.

676
01:07:14,373 --> 01:07:17,146
And I've been thinking about you
morning, noon, night

677
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,370
and in-between times.

678
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:21,130
What?!

679
01:07:21,373 --> 01:07:22,373
Why, I know you've been busy,

680
01:07:22,386 --> 01:07:25,530
but you could make the theatre tonight, couldn't you?

681
01:07:25,773 --> 01:07:27,160
Well, I'll leave a ticket at your hotel.

682
01:07:44,506 --> 01:07:46,520
Where shall we go from here?

683
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:51,293
Why, Michael, that's up to you after all, this is your evening.

684
01:07:51,293 --> 01:07:55,266
I don't know where to go any more.
I just came back, you know?

685
01:08:08,866 --> 01:08:10,720
Hello. Hello.

686
01:08:25,066 --> 01:08:28,210
- Let me tell him.        -No.
- I'll go get him.         -No. No.

687
01:08:35,933 --> 01:08:39,520
It's tough. First time you're able to get out,

688
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,490
and you have to meet HIM.

689
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,300
All I could say was, "Hello."

690
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:06,910
Well, the show's over.
The boy got the girl. Shall we go?

691
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,840
It seems terrible taking you home
with everybody going out.

692
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,893
I'm going to ask you once more,
why don't you let me help you?

693
01:09:35,946 --> 01:09:37,960
And I'm going to tell you once more,

694
01:09:38,066 --> 01:09:41,400
if I let you finance
my getting well, he wouldn't like it.

695
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:43,026
And if he wouldn't like it,
then I wouldn't like it.

696
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,173
And if you did get me well and I went
to him, you wouldn't like it.

697
01:09:46,213 --> 01:09:47,973
Then, certainly, he ought to know.

698
01:09:47,986 --> 01:09:51,226
No, because if he found out,
he'd want to do something about it.

699
01:09:51,333 --> 01:09:53,200
Then if I didn't get well,

700
01:09:53,253 --> 01:09:56,986
he wouldn't like it, and I wouldn't like it, you wouldn't like it.

701
01:09:57,026 --> 01:10:02,170
It would be awful!
No, unless I can walk to him one day

702
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:04,740
and when I say walk, I mean run

703
01:10:04,973 --> 01:10:06,786
he'll never know.

704
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,626
But I've got my job now and I'm on a budget

705
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:13,000
and if everything works out all right and I'm a good little girl,

706
01:10:13,146 --> 01:10:16,100
maybe I'll get what I want next Christmas.

707
01:10:22,453 --> 01:10:23,626
Thank you, ladies. Goodnight.

708
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:25,053
Are you sure you don't want to come with us?

709
01:10:25,066 --> 01:10:26,733
The evening is so young and everything.

710
01:10:26,746 --> 01:10:29,400
No, I think I'll turn in. Some other time.

711
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,920
Merry Christmas, everybody.
Merry Christmas.

712
01:10:32,106 --> 01:10:36,930
- Taking you to the theatre wasn't a very good idea, was it, Michael?
- No.

713
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:44,240
Merry Christmas, Lois.
Merry Christmas, Michael. Thank you.

714
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:14,120
What's the matter, buddy?
Feeling sorry for yourself?

715
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,930
Yeah. Yeah?

716
01:11:16,586 --> 01:11:18,490
You don't know what troubles are.

717
01:11:26,733 --> 01:11:32,380
Look at me, I live at 186th Street
and they won't let me on the subway.

718
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:37,140
Oh, excuse me, lady.

719
01:11:41,386 --> 01:11:44,346
Good morning. Good morning.
She's not feeling very well.

720
01:11:44,413 --> 01:11:48,190
Oh, that's too bad.
- But she wants to see you. Go on in.          -Thank you.

721
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,146
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas!

722
01:11:52,210 --> 01:11:54,600
Merry Christmas!

723
01:11:54,626 --> 01:11:57,150
Good morning.
Morning, Miss McKay.

724
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,493
Hello. Hello.

725
01:12:00,466 --> 01:12:03,506
I've bad news for you.
Doctor says I can't go.

726
01:12:03,630 --> 01:12:05,400
Aw!

727
01:12:05,573 --> 01:12:08,160
Look, Doctor, I could be back in a couple of hours.

728
01:12:08,253 --> 01:12:11,653
This is a Christmas benefit.
It's their first public appearance!

729
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:15,360
- This is my team!
- She's our coach, Doc!

730
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,480
Doctor.

731
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:23,560
If it was going to hurt her, you wouldn't want her to go, would you?

732
01:12:23,573 --> 01:12:28,733
No.
You really don't need the piano.

733
01:12:29,933 --> 01:12:31,310
Come on, go through it once without me.

734
01:12:31,733 --> 01:12:33,930
The only place you might get stuck
is right at the beginning,

735
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,090
and Aloysius can sing an "A" in his sleep. Can't ya, Al? 

736
01:12:37,093 --> 01:12:39,066
- Sure. 
- Come on, let's hear it.

737
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:46,053
- See? Now, ready.

and she won't be able to go on the stage.

741
01:12:55,106 --> 01:12:57,080
Aw! Come here, darling.

742
01:12:58,626 --> 01:13:00,426
A pretty new dress, too.

Well, then, I tell you what you do,

746
01:13:07,626 --> 01:13:10,346
you go right along with the rest of them  and you pretend to sing.

747
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,413
You know, make believe. Like this.

748
01:13:14,573 --> 01:13:16,240

of a Christmas for you, is it?

No, I guess not.

774
01:15:36,986 --> 01:15:39,773
Oh, wait. There.

775
01:15:40,306 --> 01:15:44,786
Thank you.        Are you comfortable?
Yes, I'm all right.

776
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:50,600
- If you want anything, you just call.
- I will.

777
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,386
Michel!

778
01:15:58,533 --> 01:15:59,360
Hello.

779
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,706
How are you, Terry?

780
01:16:06,906 --> 01:16:08,320
It's good to see you!

781
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,560
Yes, it's good to see you, too.

782
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,613
- Feeling all right? 
- Oh, yes, I'm fine. I'm just resting. Oh.

783
01:16:26,653 --> 01:16:28,053
It's been a long time.

784
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,746
Yes. Yes, that's right.

785
01:16:31,973 --> 01:16:33,866
Good to see you.

786
01:16:33,973 --> 01:16:36,290
Yes, you said that.

787
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,960
- May I? 
- Oh, yes, sit down. Thank you.

788
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,040
Only a little minute.

789
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,093
You sure you don't mind, I...?

790
01:16:51,546 --> 01:16:54,290
I bet you're wondering how I got here.

791
01:16:54,733 --> 01:16:58,760
I was looking in the telephone book for a man named McBride,

792
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,653
when I saw the name of Terry McKay.

793
01:17:01,666 --> 01:17:07,180
So I said to myself, "Could that be Terry McKay, my old friend?"

794
01:17:07,853 --> 01:17:10,620
- And it was. 
- Yes.

795
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:16,573
Then I said to myself, "I haven't been very nice to Miss McKay."

796
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:20,270
After all, I had an appointment with her one day at...

797
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:28,470
And...I didn't keep it.

798
01:17:34,026 --> 01:17:39,720
That wasn't a very nice way to treat an old friend, was it?

799
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:50,160
So I said to myself,
"I must apologise." And here I am.

800
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,253
- That's sweet of you.
- Yes, I think so.

801
01:17:53,506 --> 01:17:58,930
- I often wondered about you, how you were. 
- Oh, you did? Really?

802
01:17:59,933 --> 01:18:03,010
Well, I... often wondered about you, too.

803
01:18:03,466 --> 01:18:08,810
So...you didn't get angry because I wasn't there?

804
01:18:10,226 --> 01:18:13,680
- What do YOU think?
- Well, you must have been at first.

805
01:18:13,933 --> 01:18:18,506
Yes, I...I was. That's what I thought. At first, I was furious.

806
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:22,920
I said, "He can't do a thing like this to me! Who does he think he is?"

807
01:18:22,946 --> 01:18:26,900
And how long did you...
I mean, did you wait long?

808
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:32,066
Well, let's see.
I...I waited until about...

809
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,893
Midnight? 

810
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,870
And then what did you do?

811
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:43,626
Well, then I was REALLY mad.

812
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:46,550
You can just imagine up there.

813
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,826
In a thunderstorm.

814
01:18:50,110 --> 01:18:51,510
Yes.

815
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:55,320
And then what did you say to yourself?

816
01:18:55,466 --> 01:18:59,266
Well, then I said, "Why don't you go home and get tight?"

817
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:03,200
- You didn't do that. 
- Didn't I?

818
01:19:04,706 --> 01:19:09,680
Maybe you took a little one every hour for about a month.

819
01:19:10,786 --> 01:19:13,253
- Well, can you blame me?
- I should say not.

820
01:19:13,306 --> 01:19:17,080
The least I could have done was to send you a note.

821
01:19:17,466 --> 01:19:18,920
Well, maybe when you thought about it,

822
01:19:18,933 --> 01:19:21,466
you didn't know where to reach me?

823
01:19:28,853 --> 01:19:33,420
But...you swore that if you ever saw me again, you'd ask.

824
01:19:35,293 --> 01:19:36,760
- You didn't? 
- No.

825
01:19:38,093 --> 01:19:43,340
No, I remembered we said
if we could make it, we'd be there,

826
01:19:43,773 --> 01:19:46,386
and if one of us didn't show up

827
01:19:46,506 --> 01:19:48,746
there must have been a darn good reason.

828
01:19:48,773 --> 01:19:52,386
- But what, for instance? 
- And the other one shouldn't ask questions.

829
01:19:52,413 --> 01:19:54,960
Asking questions is...

830
01:19:55,226 --> 01:19:58,306
Life must be bright. We must keep it beautiful and bubbling

831
01:19:58,306 --> 01:20:00,560
like pink champagne.

832
01:20:00,773 --> 01:20:05,453
So there'll be no questions asked...
I hope.

833
01:20:12,226 --> 01:20:13,573
Cigarette?

834
01:20:16,653 --> 01:20:18,520
Thank you.

835
01:20:20,666 --> 01:20:22,680
Thank you.

836
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:35,090
Think of me, walking all the way up here, ten blocks, to...

837
01:20:39,053 --> 01:20:43,560
And instead, I promise not even
to ask you why you didn't show up.

838
01:20:43,666 --> 01:20:49,053
- You knew I was going to? It doesn't seem fair, somehow. 
- I know.

839
01:20:49,226 --> 01:20:53,460
I don't know what it is, but when I'm with you, I...

840
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:54,900
Well...

841
01:21:07,493 --> 01:21:10,586
- No wedding ring? 
- No.

842
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,066
Well, I thought when I saw you at the...

843
01:21:13,173 --> 01:21:18,150
At the theatre last night?
No, he was... No.

844
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:20,190
I didn't mean to offend you.

845
01:21:22,066 --> 01:21:24,360
How's everything with you, Michel?

846
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:28,693
- Oh, so YOU can ask questions? 
- Yeah.

847
01:21:29,146 --> 01:21:32,880
Well, I thought everything was fine
until I saw you last night.

848
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,240
Then I knew there must be something between us.

849
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:38,960
Even if only an ocean.

850
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,840
Oh. So I bought myself a ticket.

851
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:48,280
- Sailing? 
- Yes.

852
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:50,170
Tonight.

853
01:21:56,106 --> 01:21:58,450
Yep.

854
01:21:59,506 --> 01:22:01,386
Well...

855
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:07,050
You're happy, aren't you?

856
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:10,460
Uh-huh.

857
01:22:10,853 --> 01:22:13,866
- And you? 
- Well, I don't know.

858
01:22:13,973 --> 01:22:17,746
I'm worried about the future,
what people will think of me.

859
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,480
They'll say, "There he goes, the mad painter."

860
01:22:21,226 --> 01:22:26,220
There must be something the matter with him. 
He doesn't like women.

861
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,146
You mean, he won't even speak to them?

862
01:22:33,146 --> 01:22:37,613
Oh, yes, yes. He sails the seven seas, 
and to every woman he meets

863
01:22:37,626 --> 01:22:40,853
he says,
"Where will you be in six months?"

864
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:43,000
- And they're there?
- Everywhere!

865
01:22:43,053 --> 01:22:46,160
Eiffel Tower, pyramids, everywhere waiting.

866
01:22:46,506 --> 01:22:49,013
But he didn't... Where is he?

867
01:22:49,253 --> 01:22:50,920
Waiting?

868
01:22:57,053 --> 01:22:58,960
Oh, you...you want to change the subject?

869
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:07,090
- Merry Christmas!
- Oh, I almost forgot.

870
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:11,026
Well...six months ago
who would have thought

871
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,213
we'd spend Christmas together?

872
01:23:12,213 --> 01:23:16,093
- By the way, I have a present for you. 
- A present?

873
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,120
Well, I wish I had something for you.

874
01:23:18,213 --> 01:23:20,360
Well, you didn't know I was going to...

875
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:26,340
Anyway, it's not really a Christmas present. 

876
01:23:30,693 --> 01:23:34,700
So that's why my letters... came back.

877
01:23:55,373 --> 01:23:58,430
She wanted you to have it. Remember?

878
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:03,590
Yes, I remember.

879
01:24:03,986 --> 01:24:05,253
I would've sent it to you,

880
01:24:05,293 --> 01:24:09,600
only I didn't know your address until two days ago.

881
01:24:11,186 --> 01:24:14,040
Well, goodbye, Terry.

882
01:24:14,853 --> 01:24:17,800
Goodbye, Michel.

883
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:43,770
You know, I painted you like that...
with a shawl.

884
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:48,533
I wish you'd seen it. Cobert says -
he's my dealer -

885
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:51,866
he's says it's the best thing I've done.

886
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,733
I didn't think I would ever part with it,

887
01:24:53,773 --> 01:24:57,280
but there was no reason for keeping it any more.

888
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,840
And then he told me about a girl
who came into his shop.

889
01:24:59,986 --> 01:25:02,133
He told me she liked it very much.

890
01:25:02,146 --> 01:25:06,200
I suppose she saw in it, well...
what I'd hoped YOU'D see.

891
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:09,480
So I told him to give it to her
because he said she was poor.

892
01:25:09,546 --> 01:25:12,670
And not only that, he told me that she...

893
01:25:18,026 --> 01:25:20,440
He told...

894
01:25:20,573 --> 01:25:23,933
- He said... 
- Yes?

895
01:25:23,946 --> 01:25:25,880
Anyway, I...

896
01:25:26,413 --> 01:25:28,946
I told him to give it to her.

897
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:31,426
Yes. She couldn't afford it

898
01:25:31,466 --> 01:25:34,946
and it was Christmas season.

899
01:25:34,986 --> 01:25:37,746
And you know me, big-hearted Michel.

900
01:25:37,786 --> 01:25:41,800
- What time does your boat sail?
- Boat?

901
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:47,720
- Why didn't you tell me, Terry?
- Darling!

902
01:26:49,413 --> 01:26:55,360
If anything had to happen to one of us, 
why did it have to be you?

903
01:26:56,186 --> 01:26:59,080
Oh, don't look at me like that.

904
01:26:59,306 --> 01:27:02,250
It wasn't anybody's fault but my own.

905
01:27:02,373 --> 01:27:05,973
I was looking...up

906
01:27:06,106 --> 01:27:09,090
at the 102nd floor.

907
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:11,973
It was the nearest thing to heaven...

908
01:27:12,066 --> 01:27:14,330
You see...

909
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:17,090
..you were there.

910
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:25,760
Don't worry...
it doesn't have to be a miracle.

911
01:27:25,986 --> 01:27:30,540
If you can paint, I can walk.

912
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:37,900
- Anything can happen, don't you think?
-  Yes, I think so.

913
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:59,150
