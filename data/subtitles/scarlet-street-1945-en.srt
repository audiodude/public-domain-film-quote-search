1
00:02:28,735 --> 00:02:30,395
Well boys, I hate to break up a good party...

2
00:02:30,495 --> 00:02:33,115
...but you can't keep
a woman waiting, can you?

3
00:02:33,215 --> 00:02:35,475
You know how it is, boys.
- Yes we do, Mr. Hogarth.

4
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:38,595
That's right, JJ.
- I'll say you can't, JJ.

5
00:02:38,695 --> 00:02:42,095
I see you can all understand, all right.

6
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:46,995
Well believe you me, boys,
I've had the time of my life tonight.

7
00:02:47,095 --> 00:02:50,155
And speaking of time, I have here...

8
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:53,292
...a 14-karat 17-jewel timepiece.

9
00:02:54,335 --> 00:02:56,750
And that's only right, because...

10
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,355
...the man I'm giving it to
is a 14-karat 17-jewel cashier.

11
00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:02,455
Hear hear.
- Hear hear.

12
00:03:02,855 --> 00:03:04,155
Pass it along to him, boys.

13
00:03:04,255 --> 00:03:08,165
That's a beautiful watch, JJ.
- It's wonderful.

14
00:03:10,575 --> 00:03:12,575
Chris.

15
00:03:17,215 --> 00:03:20,190
Read what's engraved inside, Chris.

16
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:25,740
To my friend Christopher Cross...

17
00:03:27,095 --> 00:03:31,090
...in token of 25 years of faithful service,...

18
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:36,444
...from JJ Hogarth, 1909-1934.

19
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:39,555
Speech. Speech.

20
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:43,355
Speak up, Chris, speak up.
- Come on, Chris, speech.

21
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:45,455
Well I...

22
00:03:45,655 --> 00:03:48,275
...I hardly know what to say, JJ.

23
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,412
This... why, it's beautiful.

24
00:03:53,215 --> 00:03:56,355
I never expected to own a watch like this.

25
00:03:56,455 --> 00:03:58,455
No sir, I...

26
00:03:58,855 --> 00:04:01,115
Well... all I can say is that...

27
00:04:01,215 --> 00:04:04,530
...we've got the best boss in New York.

28
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Good going, friend.

29
00:04:19,295 --> 00:04:20,675
Congratulations, old boy,
congratulations.

30
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:22,775
Good boy, good boy.

31
00:04:23,775 --> 00:04:26,635
Thank you, Chris.
Thank you, my old friend.

32
00:04:26,735 --> 00:04:28,945
God bless you.
- Thank you.

33
00:04:29,255 --> 00:04:32,595
Have a smoke before I go.
- Well, I... don't usually, JJ.

34
00:04:32,695 --> 00:04:34,395
Go ahead and try it.

35
00:04:34,495 --> 00:04:36,995
It's made special for me.
A dollar apiece.

36
00:04:37,095 --> 00:04:39,484
Here, Charlie.
- Oh, thanks.

37
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:50,435
Thank you.

38
00:04:50,535 --> 00:04:52,555
You're not supersticious,
are you, Chris?

39
00:04:52,655 --> 00:04:54,655
No, no, no sir, no sir.

40
00:04:56,135 --> 00:04:58,100
Now don't break up a good party,
just because I've got to go.

41
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,048
Everything is charged to JJ.

42
00:05:01,495 --> 00:05:03,875
That's very nice of you, boss.

43
00:05:03,975 --> 00:05:05,275
You can drink all you want...

44
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:10,220
...only don't come in late Monday
morning with a hangover.

45
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,755
Good night, boys.

46
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:14,855
Good night.

47
00:05:20,095 --> 00:05:22,500
Aren't you a lucky dog. - I'll
treasure this for the rest of my life.

48
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
I'll bet you will.

49
00:05:27,015 --> 00:05:29,820
Hey fellas, look.
Look, come here.

50
00:05:31,135 --> 00:05:33,135
Hurry.

51
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,255
Get a load of that dame.

52
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:45,935
That's JJ's wife?

53
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:48,780
The boss is stepping out.

54
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:56,255
If I had his dough, I'd step out too.
- Must be a load of laundry tonight.

55
00:06:03,215 --> 00:06:05,395
There's nothing like the smell of spring.

56
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:07,395
Which way do you go, Chris?

57
00:06:07,495 --> 00:06:09,395
I guess I'll take the East Side subway.

58
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:12,895
It gets me to Brooklyn a little quicker.

59
00:06:14,855 --> 00:06:17,635
Hey, you haven't got an umbrella.
No, I'll take you to your bus.

60
00:06:17,735 --> 00:06:20,435
No, it's out of your way.
- I don't mind walking.

61
00:06:20,535 --> 00:06:22,745
The fresh air, the spring.

62
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:26,415
I'm a little drunk.

63
00:06:43,095 --> 00:06:45,635
Never mind, I'll catch the next one.

64
00:06:45,735 --> 00:06:47,035
You go on over to the subway.

65
00:06:47,135 --> 00:06:51,810
No, I don't mind waiting,
I feel kind of lonely tonight.

66
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:56,215
Say, Charlie...

67
00:06:57,015 --> 00:06:59,955
You suppose JJ is running around
with that young lady?

68
00:07:00,055 --> 00:07:02,055
It looks that way.

69
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:07,805
I wonder what it's like.
- What, Chris?

70
00:07:07,815 --> 00:07:11,251
To be loved by a young girl like that.

71
00:07:12,295 --> 00:07:16,115
You know, nobody ever looked at me
like that, not even when I was young.

72
00:07:16,215 --> 00:07:18,715
Yes, when we're young we have
dreams that never pan out...

73
00:07:18,815 --> 00:07:21,010
...but we go on dreaming.

74
00:07:21,255 --> 00:07:23,715
When I was young,
I wanted to be an artist.

75
00:07:23,815 --> 00:07:26,795
I dreamt I was going to be a
great painter someday.

76
00:07:26,895 --> 00:07:28,895
So I'm a cashier.

77
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,475
Do you still paint?
- Yes, every Sunday.

78
00:07:31,575 --> 00:07:33,555
That's one way to kill time.

79
00:07:33,655 --> 00:07:35,835
You know, Sunday is the one day
of the week I don't like.

80
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,035
I never know what to do with myself.

81
00:07:37,135 --> 00:07:43,425
Why don't you come over tomorrow and
see me? - Thanks, Chris, I'll do that.

82
00:07:44,335 --> 00:07:46,435
Good night, Chris.
- Good night, Charlie. See you tomorrow.

83
00:07:46,535 --> 00:07:48,535
Good night.

84
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:07,075
It stopped raining.
- Yeah, half an hour ago.

85
00:08:07,175 --> 00:08:09,035
Which way is it to the East Side subway?

86
00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:10,755
Around the corner, past the 'L',

87
00:08:10,855 --> 00:08:13,235
four blocks.
- Thank you, Officer.

88
00:08:13,335 --> 00:08:14,315
I guess I got turned around.

89
00:08:14,415 --> 00:08:19,430
These streets are all mixed up
in Greenwich Village. - Yeah.

90
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,075
Is he hurt?

91
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:09,495
I'll go call a policeman.
- No, wait... wait.

92
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:20,815
Officer.

93
00:09:20,915 --> 00:09:22,915
Officer.

94
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:40,015
Where did they go?
- In that direction.

95
00:09:40,115 --> 00:09:41,655
What does he look like?
- I don't know.

96
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:43,855
I didn't see his face.
- He took 15 dollars.

97
00:09:43,955 --> 00:09:46,215
He didn't believe it was all
I had, so he began pushing me around...

98
00:09:46,315 --> 00:09:48,295
...and this gentleman ran in
and knocked him down.

99
00:09:48,395 --> 00:09:49,935
That's right, Officer,
he was right there.

100
00:09:50,035 --> 00:09:52,055
I couldn't hold him, he got up and ran.

101
00:09:52,155 --> 00:09:54,155
Wait here.

102
00:09:55,235 --> 00:09:56,815
Come on, let's get out of here.

103
00:09:56,915 --> 00:09:58,295
But we have to wait for the officer.

104
00:09:58,395 --> 00:10:00,415
I don't want to get my name
in the newspaper, do you?

105
00:10:00,515 --> 00:10:01,655
The newspaper?
- Sure.

106
00:10:01,755 --> 00:10:03,335
We'll have to go down to the
station house and make a complaint.

107
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:04,815
And every time they make an arrest,
they send a detective to your house...

108
00:10:04,915 --> 00:10:07,805
...for weeks. Oh, it's a nuisance.

109
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:11,335
Won't you take me home?
- Why, yes...

110
00:10:12,635 --> 00:10:16,375
Well, sure... that is...
if you think that...

111
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,085
Well, here's where I live.

112
00:10:23,715 --> 00:10:25,935
I'm sorry I can't ask you to come up.

113
00:10:26,035 --> 00:10:29,945
I share my apartment
with another girl, Millie.

114
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:33,425
Good night, and thanks for everything.

115
00:10:34,315 --> 00:10:35,935
Don't you...

116
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,925
...don't you want a cup of coffee?

117
00:10:39,435 --> 00:10:41,435
All right.

118
00:10:56,515 --> 00:10:58,810
Hello, Kitty.
- Hello, Tiny.

119
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:01,160
Oh, this is Mr...
- Cross.

120
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:05,335
Glad to know you, Mr. Cross.
- How do you do.

121
00:11:05,595 --> 00:11:07,595
You seen Johnny?

122
00:11:08,555 --> 00:11:10,850
No, not since he left here.

123
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:13,695
Two coffees, please.
- I think I changed my mind.

124
00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:15,495
I could stand a drink-a Rum Collins.

125
00:11:15,595 --> 00:11:18,029
One Rum Collins?
- Yes, yes.

126
00:11:18,355 --> 00:11:20,735
Oh come on, keep me company.

127
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:24,895
Well, you see I've already had
a good deal of champagne...

128
00:11:24,995 --> 00:11:27,545
You want champagne?
- No, no...

129
00:11:28,435 --> 00:11:30,435
Make mine the same.

130
00:11:31,715 --> 00:11:35,935
You know, ever since I first saw you
I was wondering what your name was.

131
00:11:36,035 --> 00:11:38,151
Kitty.
- It's really-

132
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:42,865
Katherine, Katherine March.

133
00:11:43,475 --> 00:11:45,625
My friends call me Kitty.

134
00:11:47,475 --> 00:11:49,655
What do your friends call you?

135
00:11:49,755 --> 00:11:51,175
Chris.

136
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:53,275
Chris Cross.

137
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:56,095
Chris Cross.

138
00:11:56,195 --> 00:11:58,495
Yes, the boys tease me about it, but

139
00:11:58,595 --> 00:12:00,595
I don't mind.

140
00:12:11,435 --> 00:12:13,645
Why are you looking at me?

141
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,875
Is my face dirty?

142
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:17,895
It's beautiful.

143
00:12:17,995 --> 00:12:19,995
I'll bet it is.

144
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,675
Gee, I'm a sight.

145
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:29,355
Thank you, sir.

146
00:12:33,435 --> 00:12:35,435
Cheers, Chris.

147
00:12:37,035 --> 00:12:39,035
Miss March...

148
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:40,455
Kitty.

149
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:42,555
Yes, Miss-I mean...

150
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,575
Kitty...

151
00:12:44,675 --> 00:12:47,314
Well, look... Kitty,...

152
00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:50,575
...since I'm old enough to be your father...

153
00:12:50,675 --> 00:12:52,675
You're not so old.

154
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:53,775
You don't think so?

155
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,595
You're not a boy, you're just...

156
00:12:57,155 --> 00:12:59,155
...mature.

157
00:12:59,475 --> 00:13:01,475
I like mature people.

158
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:04,720
Well, what I wanted to say was...

159
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:08,655
...you shouldn't be alone in the
street so late at night.

160
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,815
I was coming home from work.

161
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,915
You work this late?

162
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:17,075
What do you do?

163
00:13:17,155 --> 00:13:19,155
Guess.

164
00:13:22,075 --> 00:13:25,390
You're an actress.
- Oh, you are clever.

165
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:28,175
Now that you know all about me,
tell me about yourself.

166
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:30,275
What do you do?
- I?

167
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:34,875
Well, you see...
- Don't tell me.

168
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,355
You work in a bank?
- No.

169
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:40,895
Well let's see, Greenwich Village
is full of artists...

170
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:43,575
I meet you in Greenwich Village...

171
00:13:43,675 --> 00:13:45,615
You must be an artist. Right?

172
00:13:45,715 --> 00:13:47,715
Well, I...

173
00:13:47,715 --> 00:13:50,975
Yes, yes, I paint.
- Of course, you're a painter.

174
00:13:51,075 --> 00:13:52,495
I love paintings.

175
00:13:52,595 --> 00:13:54,935
To think I took you for a cashier.

176
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:56,175
Well...

177
00:13:56,275 --> 00:13:58,415
You know those art galleries
on Fifth Avenue?

178
00:13:58,515 --> 00:13:59,655
The prices they charge.

179
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:03,335
I saw one little picture
that cost 50,000 dollars.

180
00:14:03,435 --> 00:14:05,435
They called it a...

181
00:14:06,155 --> 00:14:07,735
Seesan.
- Cezanne.

182
00:14:07,835 --> 00:14:10,385
He was a great French painter.

183
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,895
I'd like to own that painting.

184
00:14:12,995 --> 00:14:14,995
You would?

185
00:14:15,795 --> 00:14:17,945
For 50,000 dollars?

186
00:14:18,395 --> 00:14:21,700
Well, you can't put any price
on masterpieces like that.

187
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,655
They're worth... well...

188
00:14:23,755 --> 00:14:26,615
Whatever you can afford to pay for them.

189
00:14:26,715 --> 00:14:29,700
You know what, I bet I saw some of
your pictures there and didn't know it.

190
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,775
Next time I'll look for your name.

191
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,875
No, no, no...

192
00:14:34,115 --> 00:14:36,240
I don't sell my pictures.

193
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,335
Not in New York, you mean?

194
00:14:38,435 --> 00:14:40,295
No, I...
- I know.

195
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:43,855
I bet you sell your pictures in Europe,
France or some place like that.

196
00:14:43,955 --> 00:14:46,215
You can tell I don't know
much about painting.

197
00:14:46,315 --> 00:14:49,095
I bet you get as much for
your pictures in France...

198
00:14:49,195 --> 00:14:51,975
...as those Frenchmen get right
here in New York.

199
00:14:52,075 --> 00:14:54,375
You're never appreciated
in your own country.

200
00:14:54,475 --> 00:14:57,455
Well, that's one way of looking at it.

201
00:14:57,555 --> 00:15:01,255
But you know, when I paint
I don't think of money.

202
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:03,869
I just paint for fun.
- Fun?

203
00:15:03,955 --> 00:15:07,575
Yes, I think it's the
most fun I know, painting.

204
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:09,935
I wish I had all the time to paint.

205
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,775
But don't you have time?
- No, I... well... yes...

206
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,991
You see, I...

207
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,875
Well, you know...

208
00:15:18,115 --> 00:15:20,100
Business takes a lot of time.

209
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,735
No wonder, when you get all that money.

210
00:15:22,835 --> 00:15:25,215
What play are you acting in?

211
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:27,695
It closed tonight.
- Which one?

212
00:15:27,795 --> 00:15:30,685
The one I was in. What time is it?

213
00:15:35,955 --> 00:15:38,594
It's only ten past two.
- Only?

214
00:15:39,515 --> 00:15:42,320
It's time for Kitty to be in bed.

215
00:15:46,515 --> 00:15:48,515
So you won't forget me.

216
00:15:49,155 --> 00:15:51,155
Thank you.

217
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:54,135
Can I see you again?
- Sure, sometime.

218
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:56,415
Well, if you give me your telephone
number... - I haven't got a phone.

219
00:15:56,515 --> 00:15:57,655
May I write you?

220
00:15:57,755 --> 00:16:00,735
That's the address. Good night, Chris.

221
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,835
Kitty, who is Johnny?

222
00:16:03,515 --> 00:16:04,935
Why do you ask that?

223
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:08,010
I just heard you ask the bartender.

224
00:16:08,115 --> 00:16:11,135
Oh sure, he's just a fella I know,
he's Millie's boyfriend.

225
00:16:11,235 --> 00:16:14,095
You know, the girl I live with?
Good night, Chris.

226
00:16:14,195 --> 00:16:16,195
Good night, Kitty.

227
00:16:51,955 --> 00:16:53,955
Christopher.

228
00:16:57,955 --> 00:16:59,955
Christopher.

229
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:03,955
Yes, Adele.

230
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:23,075
This is a pleasure. I didn't expect to
see you, Charlie. - But you asked me.

231
00:17:24,475 --> 00:17:26,475
My wife...

232
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,690
Well, it's good to see you anyway.

233
00:17:30,155 --> 00:17:32,055
That was a swell party last night,
wasn't it, Charlie?

234
00:17:32,155 --> 00:17:34,705
Say, what time did we go home?

235
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:36,965
After midnight, wasn't it?

236
00:17:39,395 --> 00:17:41,175
You know, I haven't been to bed yet.

237
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:42,135
You haven't?

238
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:44,335
I guess I might as well act as drunk
as I thought I was, eh Charlie?

239
00:17:44,435 --> 00:17:45,855
No, no...

240
00:17:45,955 --> 00:17:48,655
Oh, I've got to do the dishes for Adele.

241
00:17:48,755 --> 00:17:53,600
You don't mind, Charlie, do you?
- No, no, go right ahead.

242
00:17:59,915 --> 00:18:01,955
Say, did you paint this?

243
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:05,695
Great Scott, no. That isn't painting,
that's mud.

244
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:08,770
Done by a photographer.
- Who is it?

245
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:11,235
The late departed...

246
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,655
Oh... your wife's former husband.

247
00:18:14,755 --> 00:18:18,543
Detective Sargeant Higgins,
Homer Higgins.

248
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:21,700
Say, that's a real medal, isn't it?

249
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,668
Yeah, Adele got it.

250
00:18:25,715 --> 00:18:27,715
Your wife?
- Yeah.

251
00:18:27,955 --> 00:18:31,270
After he was drowned in the East River.

252
00:18:31,955 --> 00:18:34,165
Jumped in to save a woman.

253
00:18:34,395 --> 00:18:36,395
Neither body was found.

254
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,109
Oh... too bad.

255
00:18:39,315 --> 00:18:41,315
Yeah, too bad.

256
00:18:50,235 --> 00:18:53,295
Oh, thank you, Charlie.
- Not at all.

257
00:18:54,515 --> 00:18:57,745
How long have you been married, Chris?

258
00:18:57,795 --> 00:18:59,795
Five years...

259
00:19:00,635 --> 00:19:02,135
Well...

260
00:19:02,235 --> 00:19:05,895
She didn't want to spend his
insurance money, so she...

261
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:08,290
...rented out a spare room.

262
00:19:09,355 --> 00:19:11,175
24 dollars a week.

263
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,135
Well, I was trying to save money to
buy paints,

264
00:19:14,235 --> 00:19:16,235
so I moved in.

265
00:19:16,435 --> 00:19:18,435
Oh, she was sweet...

266
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:21,525
Butter wouldn't melt in her mouth.

267
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,995
And...

268
00:19:25,435 --> 00:19:28,055
Well, you know how these things go.

269
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:29,935
Smoke?

270
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:32,035
Oh...

271
00:19:32,035 --> 00:19:34,035
...guess I better not.

272
00:19:38,515 --> 00:19:40,215
Where are your paintings, Chris?

273
00:19:40,315 --> 00:19:42,135
They're out in the hall.

274
00:19:42,235 --> 00:19:47,165
Would you like to see what
I did today? - Yes, I'd like to.

275
00:19:59,235 --> 00:20:02,545
Where did you find a flower like that?

276
00:20:05,995 --> 00:20:09,710
You mean you see this
when you look at... that?

277
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:13,869
Well, yes... that is, I sort of feel it.

278
00:20:14,355 --> 00:20:18,055
You see, when I look at that
flower, I see someone...

279
00:20:18,155 --> 00:20:21,555
Is there anything private in this house?

280
00:20:23,075 --> 00:20:25,075
I'm sorry, Adele.

281
00:20:25,395 --> 00:20:27,605
We better get out of here.

282
00:20:34,155 --> 00:20:36,155
All right, Adele...

283
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,495
Can't you get those lazy legs
off that couch, maybe?

284
00:21:24,595 --> 00:21:26,595
Come here.

285
00:21:28,395 --> 00:21:30,455
Can't you do any better than that?

286
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,615
That's all you think about,
Lazy Legs, hmm?

287
00:21:32,715 --> 00:21:35,775
What else is there to think about...

288
00:21:41,155 --> 00:21:42,895
If you want more heat
in this apartment, Miss...

289
00:21:42,995 --> 00:21:45,975
...you'll have to call a janitor.
- You idiot.

290
00:21:46,075 --> 00:21:47,895
How come you're holding out on me, Baby?

291
00:21:47,995 --> 00:21:50,575
Oh, stop talking about Saturday night.

292
00:21:50,675 --> 00:21:55,945
I'm not talking about Saturday night...
I'm talking about this.

293
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:59,215
It sounds like a schoolboy
trying to make a date.

294
00:21:59,315 --> 00:22:01,655
You must be robbing the cradle.

295
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:03,495
What's so funny?
- You are.

296
00:22:03,595 --> 00:22:05,455
He's old enough to be my father.

297
00:22:05,555 --> 00:22:10,095
That's the old fellow who came
to my rescue Saturday night... My hero.

298
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:11,935
No kidding.

299
00:22:12,035 --> 00:22:15,055
See? You were too tight
to remember anything.

300
00:22:15,155 --> 00:22:17,775
If I hadn't told the cop to go in the
wrong direction he'd have picked you up.

301
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,175
This the old fellow who butted in?

302
00:22:20,275 --> 00:22:21,975
The painter?

303
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:25,735
He's rich and famous and
very sweet too, Johnny.

304
00:22:25,835 --> 00:22:28,175
He doesn't pull any rough stuff like you.

305
00:22:28,275 --> 00:22:30,495
Why, I had a chance
to clean up in a crap game.

306
00:22:30,595 --> 00:22:32,455
All I needed was 50 bucks...

307
00:22:32,555 --> 00:22:35,495
And what did you show up with?
15, for cat's sake.

308
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:37,095
That's all I had.

309
00:22:37,195 --> 00:22:40,175
Besides, you kept me waiting
two hours in the rain.

310
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:43,575
And then you gave me a dirty look.
- I didn't give you a dirty look.

311
00:22:43,675 --> 00:22:50,305
Any girl who waits 2 hours in the rain
for a guy is gonna give him a dirty look

312
00:22:50,835 --> 00:22:54,895
Trouble with you, baby, is
you have no imagination.

313
00:22:54,995 --> 00:22:59,495
What do you expect me to do?
- I expect you to use your brains.

314
00:22:59,595 --> 00:23:01,975
For cat's sake this chump
is crazy about you.

315
00:23:02,075 --> 00:23:05,095
This is a set-up. He's in
the big money, isn't he?

316
00:23:05,195 --> 00:23:07,935
You said 50,000 a picture, didn't you?

317
00:23:08,035 --> 00:23:11,295
And here I am, knocking my brains out,
trying to raise a little capital...

318
00:23:11,395 --> 00:23:13,495
...and this is right in your lap.

319
00:23:13,595 --> 00:23:15,735
You don't have to call what's-his-name...

320
00:23:15,835 --> 00:23:17,695
...and get a measly 50.

321
00:23:17,795 --> 00:23:19,775
This bird is goofy about you.

322
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:21,875
Write him, date him up.

323
00:23:21,955 --> 00:23:25,695
I can't take money off an old man like that.

324
00:23:27,635 --> 00:23:29,775
For cat's sake, get big-hearted...

325
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,548
...and smart, Lazy Legs.

326
00:23:32,635 --> 00:23:35,775
Why, I see fellas in the big dough
without half my brains...

327
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,615
...but ability isn't enough.

328
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:40,455
You gotta have money to make money.
Capital.

329
00:23:40,555 --> 00:23:42,175
But the boys at the Acme Garage would...

330
00:23:42,275 --> 00:23:44,615
...cut me in on a half-interest if I
can put up the money.

331
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,695
How much do they want?
- Three or four thousand.

332
00:23:47,795 --> 00:23:48,895
Yipe.

333
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:50,600
For cat's sake, I'm not talking
about chicken feed.

334
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,234
Use your imagination.

335
00:23:53,915 --> 00:23:56,175
You get an interest in a business like that...

336
00:23:56,275 --> 00:23:59,055
...and it's a cinch to squeeze out
your partners.

337
00:23:59,155 --> 00:24:00,895
Then you're on easy street.

338
00:24:00,995 --> 00:24:03,885
Jeepers, the pipe dreams you have.

339
00:24:03,995 --> 00:24:05,455
Now what about the letter?

340
00:24:05,555 --> 00:24:08,255
Oh, I can get 50 or a hundred perhaps,
but I can't get...

341
00:24:08,355 --> 00:24:13,095
...the kind of money you're talking about,
I wouldn't know how.

342
00:24:13,195 --> 00:24:14,895
Johnny.

343
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,695
Johnny, where are you going?
- Where I won't be wasting my time.

344
00:24:17,795 --> 00:24:19,831
Johnny, Johnny...

345
00:24:24,815 --> 00:24:27,675
I don't know why I'm so crazy about you.

346
00:24:27,775 --> 00:24:29,775
Oh, yes you do...

347
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,925
Now what about my proposition?

348
00:24:33,975 --> 00:24:35,915
You don't have to tap the old
chump for much...

349
00:24:36,015 --> 00:24:37,235
...not at first.

350
00:24:37,335 --> 00:24:38,835
We'll get you a decent apartment.

351
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:42,435
Someplace where I'll like to come and
see you, not a dump like this.

352
00:24:42,535 --> 00:24:44,535
Well, Lazy Legs?

353
00:24:46,095 --> 00:24:49,315
May I come in to my own apartment?
- Hello, Funny Face.

354
00:24:49,415 --> 00:24:50,875
Why don't you just move in, Johnny?

355
00:24:50,975 --> 00:24:52,715
Then I can move out.
- Now, Millie...

356
00:24:52,815 --> 00:24:56,035
Stop picking on my fiancé.
- How do you spell that word?

357
00:24:56,135 --> 00:24:58,635
With an 'F', like in 'Funny Face'.

358
00:24:58,735 --> 00:25:00,395
She pays half the rent, doesn't she?

359
00:25:00,495 --> 00:25:03,035
That was the general idea, Big Shot,
when we signed the lease.

360
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:05,915
I don't mind if you want
this place to yourself.

361
00:25:06,015 --> 00:25:08,015
To you, Baby.

362
00:25:12,215 --> 00:25:15,875
What's he mean by that?
- Oh, nothing. You know Johnny.

363
00:25:15,975 --> 00:25:17,875
Yeah, I know Johnny all right.

364
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:20,115
Has he bought you
that engagement ring yet?

365
00:25:20,215 --> 00:25:23,785
You seem to worry more about it than I do.

366
00:25:30,535 --> 00:25:32,395
The new 45-dollar model.

367
00:25:32,495 --> 00:25:35,475
Only Roger let me have it for 18.
He said he made a profit at that.

368
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,995
I thought you said you were
modeling girdles for the catalog?

369
00:25:38,095 --> 00:25:40,095
I have been.

370
00:25:41,175 --> 00:25:43,175
I ache like a dog.

371
00:25:43,415 --> 00:25:47,920
If corsets ever come back,
I swear I'll quit modeling.

372
00:25:50,095 --> 00:25:51,795
Why don't you go back to work?

373
00:25:51,895 --> 00:25:54,995
With that figure, if you
weren't so darn lazy...

374
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:58,750
Who do you think you are,
my guardian angel?

375
00:25:59,055 --> 00:26:02,635
Not me, honey. I lost those
wings a long time ago.

376
00:26:02,735 --> 00:26:04,555
That's what I thought.

377
00:26:04,655 --> 00:26:06,995
No wonder you got fired,
you're so darn snippy.

378
00:26:07,095 --> 00:26:08,755
You never could get to work on time...

379
00:26:08,855 --> 00:26:11,320
...after you met that Johnny.

380
00:26:12,415 --> 00:26:14,155
Honey, what's happened to you?

381
00:26:14,255 --> 00:26:16,515
Don't you wish it could happen to you.

382
00:26:16,615 --> 00:26:18,715
I'm in love, crazy in love.

383
00:26:18,815 --> 00:26:20,915
With a man who pushes you around
the way I wouldn't push a cat around.

384
00:26:21,015 --> 00:26:22,035
You leave Johnny out of this.

385
00:26:22,135 --> 00:26:23,875
With your looks and figure
you could get any man you want.

386
00:26:23,975 --> 00:26:27,092
Sure, but there's only one I want.

387
00:26:27,415 --> 00:26:28,875
Yeah, and he's making a tramp out of you.

388
00:26:28,975 --> 00:26:31,155
You wouldn't know love if it
hit you in the face.

389
00:26:31,255 --> 00:26:35,165
If that's where it hits you,
you ought to know.

390
00:27:21,295 --> 00:27:24,185
That robin sings just like I feel.

391
00:27:24,775 --> 00:27:30,385
Look, there's a pair of them up there,
they're building their nest.

392
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,115
Say, where'd you learn that?

393
00:27:37,415 --> 00:27:39,415
When I was a kid.

394
00:27:39,495 --> 00:27:42,555
But I haven't done that in 40 years.

395
00:27:42,615 --> 00:27:45,250
I feel like a kid myself today.

396
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,955
Sold any pictures lately?

397
00:27:50,055 --> 00:27:51,075
No.

398
00:27:51,175 --> 00:27:53,275
Why don't you paint my picture?

399
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:55,115
I'd like to.

400
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,195
Could I bring my easel to your apartment?

401
00:27:57,295 --> 00:27:59,515
I'm afraid my girlfriend wouldn't like that.

402
00:27:59,615 --> 00:28:02,235
How long does it take you
to paint a picture?

403
00:28:02,335 --> 00:28:05,035
Sometimes a day, sometimes a year.

404
00:28:05,135 --> 00:28:07,395
You can't tell, it has to grow.

405
00:28:07,495 --> 00:28:09,515
I never knew paint could grow.

406
00:28:09,615 --> 00:28:11,075
Feeling grows.

407
00:28:11,175 --> 00:28:13,355
You know,
that's the important thing... feeling.

408
00:28:13,455 --> 00:28:16,755
Now you take me, nobody ever
taught me how to draw,

409
00:28:16,855 --> 00:28:19,915
so I just put a line around what
I feel when I look at things.

410
00:28:20,015 --> 00:28:21,235
Yeah, I see.

411
00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:23,335
It's like...

412
00:28:23,975 --> 00:28:26,875
...it's like falling in love, I guess.

413
00:28:26,975 --> 00:28:28,475
You know...

414
00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:32,555
First you see someone, and
then it keeps growing...

415
00:28:32,655 --> 00:28:34,755
...until you can't think of anyone else.

416
00:28:34,855 --> 00:28:36,855
That's interesting.

417
00:28:36,855 --> 00:28:39,555
The way I look at things,
that's all art is.

418
00:28:39,655 --> 00:28:43,675
Every painting, if it's
any good, is a love affair.

419
00:28:43,775 --> 00:28:47,075
I never heard anyone talk like that before.

420
00:28:47,175 --> 00:28:48,795
Well...

421
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:52,355
...there aren't many people
you can talk to this way.

422
00:28:52,455 --> 00:28:54,435
So you keep it to yourself.

423
00:28:54,535 --> 00:28:56,995
You walk around
with everything bottled up.

424
00:28:57,095 --> 00:28:59,095
Yeah, that's right.

425
00:28:59,175 --> 00:29:01,980
That's the way it is with me too.

426
00:29:02,335 --> 00:29:06,415
I'm sort of keeping things
bottled up too, Chris.

427
00:29:07,135 --> 00:29:09,195
The truth is, I'm in a jam.

428
00:29:09,295 --> 00:29:11,155
You, Kitty?
- You probably guessed it...

429
00:29:11,255 --> 00:29:12,315
I'm broke.

430
00:29:12,415 --> 00:29:17,005
Even this dress belongs to Millie,
I can't pay my rent.

431
00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:20,035
How much is it?
- Oh, forget it.

432
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:22,345
I shouldn't have told you.

433
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:26,835
It'll spoil your day.
- Oh, but Kitty...

434
00:29:26,935 --> 00:29:27,915
I'll get out of it somehow.

435
00:29:28,015 --> 00:29:30,155
I couldn't take anything from you, Chris.

436
00:29:30,255 --> 00:29:33,515
Well, no... yes... I mean...
- No, no, I couldn't.

437
00:29:33,615 --> 00:29:36,395
I've never taken money from a man
and I'm not going to now.

438
00:29:36,495 --> 00:29:38,835
And I'm not going to spoil our friendship.

439
00:29:38,935 --> 00:29:40,355
Oh, but Kitty...

440
00:29:40,455 --> 00:29:42,495
I couldn't pay you back.

441
00:29:44,895 --> 00:29:46,895
Chris.

442
00:29:47,015 --> 00:29:48,555
Maybe I could pay you back.

443
00:29:48,655 --> 00:29:50,315
If you put up the money
for a studio apartment,

444
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:55,395
then I'd have a place to live, and you
could paint there. Don't you see?

445
00:29:55,495 --> 00:29:57,875
You could paint my portrait.

446
00:30:01,775 --> 00:30:03,775
What's the matter?

447
00:30:03,855 --> 00:30:05,835
Don't you want to paint my picture?

448
00:30:05,935 --> 00:30:08,475
There's something I've got
to tell you, Kitty. - What?

449
00:30:08,575 --> 00:30:10,575
I deceived you.

450
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,975
I lied.

451
00:30:14,935 --> 00:30:17,060
I'm a married man, Kitty.

452
00:30:20,095 --> 00:30:22,645
Why didn't you tell me, Chris?

453
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:27,315
You know I'm not the kind to run
around with a married man, don't you?

454
00:30:27,415 --> 00:30:30,755
You know what you said
about meeting someone?

455
00:30:30,855 --> 00:30:32,955
How you begin to like them, and...

456
00:30:33,055 --> 00:30:36,515
...and you can't think about anybody else?

457
00:30:36,615 --> 00:30:39,355
You should have told me
you had a wife, Chris.

458
00:30:39,455 --> 00:30:42,195
Yes, but I'm not in love with her,
Kitty. - Well, you married her.

459
00:30:42,295 --> 00:30:46,035
I was lonely,
I couldn't stand my loneliness.

460
00:30:47,495 --> 00:30:49,495
Poor Chris.

461
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:51,475
Then you're not angry with me?

462
00:30:51,575 --> 00:30:55,060
Why, I suppose I ought to be,
but I'm not.

463
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,895
Not with you, Chris.

464
00:30:57,895 --> 00:30:59,515
I'm going to let you help me.

465
00:30:59,615 --> 00:31:02,590
How much do you need?
- 500 dollars.

466
00:31:07,895 --> 00:31:09,895
500...

467
00:31:53,575 --> 00:31:55,770
I need 500 dollars.

468
00:31:56,295 --> 00:31:58,435
I could pay it back 10 dollars a week.

469
00:31:58,535 --> 00:32:00,475
That's all right, Mr. Cross.

470
00:32:00,575 --> 00:32:02,435
But you'll have to have a co-signer.

471
00:32:02,535 --> 00:32:05,035
Thank you, no.
- Property owner.

472
00:32:05,135 --> 00:32:08,025
Property owner?
- Just a formality.

473
00:32:11,975 --> 00:32:14,525
Thank you very much.
- Anytime.

474
00:32:16,175 --> 00:32:17,315
Well, write to that old skin-flint Hogarth...

475
00:32:17,415 --> 00:32:19,195
...to give you a raise.

476
00:32:19,295 --> 00:32:21,795
You don't even make enough
money to buy me a radio.

477
00:32:21,895 --> 00:32:25,355
I have to run downstairs every
night to listen to the radio.

478
00:32:25,455 --> 00:32:26,955
The way I have to scrimp and save...

479
00:32:27,055 --> 00:32:29,875
...and you wasting money on paints.

480
00:32:29,975 --> 00:32:32,155
I'd like to know what you'd do without me...

481
00:32:32,255 --> 00:32:33,755
Poor dear Homer.

482
00:32:33,855 --> 00:32:36,875
If only he had a grave where
I could put some flowers.

483
00:32:36,975 --> 00:32:38,955
Why, you couldn't ask me to marry you.

484
00:32:39,055 --> 00:32:43,355
I had to put the words into your mouth.
I'd have been better off a widow.

485
00:32:43,455 --> 00:32:45,875
The only reason I put up with you
is because I'm married to you...

486
00:32:45,975 --> 00:32:48,950
I'm stuck.
- Yes, and I'm stuck too.

487
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:51,735
Have you been drinking?

488
00:32:51,855 --> 00:32:53,275
No, I haven't.

489
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:55,500
Let me smell your breath.

490
00:32:58,095 --> 00:33:01,075
Then what's the matter with you?
Why are you shouting at me?

491
00:33:01,175 --> 00:33:03,235
You keep blaming me for not
buying you a radio.

492
00:33:03,335 --> 00:33:05,995
You think I like running downstairs
every night to listen to the radio?

493
00:33:06,095 --> 00:33:09,475
Why don't you buy a radio? You have
money. - His insurance money?

494
00:33:09,575 --> 00:33:11,235
Well, I don't want a radio,
you want it.

495
00:33:11,335 --> 00:33:15,235
I'll never touch those bonds.
They're for my old age.

496
00:33:15,335 --> 00:33:17,315
If Homer were alive I'd have a radio.

497
00:33:17,415 --> 00:33:20,675
He made a good salary.
He gave me a good home.

498
00:33:20,775 --> 00:33:22,600
Well, you're living in the
same apartment, aren't you?

499
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,760
Yes... but it didn't smell of paint.

500
00:33:26,615 --> 00:33:28,395
I can't sleep for the smell of paint.

501
00:33:28,495 --> 00:33:30,475
And all your silly pictures
cluttering up the hall...

502
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:31,835
If you don't get rid of that trash...

503
00:33:31,935 --> 00:33:34,995
I swear I'll give it to the junkman.

504
00:33:36,255 --> 00:33:38,255
Adele.
- I will.

505
00:33:38,655 --> 00:33:40,655
I swear I will.

506
00:33:40,975 --> 00:33:43,155
And the things you paint...

507
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:46,075
It was bad enough when you used to
copy picture postcards.

508
00:33:46,175 --> 00:33:50,155
Well, Utrillo copies postcards,
and he's considered a great painter.

509
00:33:50,255 --> 00:33:54,115
And now I suppose you're copying
Utrillo or whatever his name is?

510
00:33:54,215 --> 00:33:57,275
And you're getting
crazier all the time... Oh, yes.

511
00:33:57,375 --> 00:33:59,075
I saw what you're doing.

512
00:33:59,175 --> 00:34:01,245
Girls... snakes...

513
00:34:01,655 --> 00:34:03,995
Next thing you'll be painting
women without clothes.

514
00:34:04,095 --> 00:34:05,955
I never saw a woman without any clothes.

515
00:34:06,055 --> 00:34:08,055
I should hope not.

516
00:34:14,255 --> 00:34:17,515
The Happy Household Hour's
just coming on, dear.

517
00:34:17,615 --> 00:34:21,865
I'll be right down, Dora.
Mr. Cross came home late.

518
00:34:24,815 --> 00:34:26,555
Go ahead and eat...

519
00:34:26,655 --> 00:34:28,865
...and then do the dishes.

520
00:34:29,135 --> 00:34:30,595
'This is The Happy Household Hour...

521
00:34:30,695 --> 00:34:33,100
...brought to you at this time
by Happy Hour Bubble Suds.

522
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,700
No soap gives you more happiness,

523
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,611
more washings and more
suds per package,

524
00:34:39,895 --> 00:34:43,500
than Happy Hour Bubble Suds.

525
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,635
Ask your nearest grocer for the large
economy-size package today.

526
00:34:46,735 --> 00:34:50,995
And now for the next episode of
'Hilda's Hope for Happiness'.

527
00:34:51,095 --> 00:34:53,195
As you remember,
we left Hilda in the laundry...

528
00:34:53,295 --> 00:34:54,635
...Bubble Suds...

529
00:34:54,735 --> 00:34:56,930
...Hilda...

530
00:35:35,935 --> 00:35:37,935
Christopher.

531
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:50,375
Christopher.

532
00:35:55,575 --> 00:35:57,115
What are you doing?

533
00:35:57,215 --> 00:35:59,635
I was...
I was looking for the paper.

534
00:35:59,735 --> 00:36:01,735
Are you blind?

535
00:36:02,215 --> 00:36:05,475
No. Didn't you...
didn't you like the radio?

536
00:36:05,575 --> 00:36:11,865
It went off right in the middle of
a program. I wouldn't have such a radio.

537
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:14,715
Say, did you read this?
- Read what?

538
00:36:14,815 --> 00:36:16,815
This murder in Queens.

539
00:36:17,295 --> 00:36:19,355
A man killed his wife
with a window weight...

540
00:36:19,455 --> 00:36:21,555
...put her body in a trunk and
shipped it to California.

541
00:36:21,655 --> 00:36:24,555
It says here...
- I read the paper, thank you.

542
00:36:24,655 --> 00:36:26,355
He didn't get away with it, did he?

543
00:36:26,455 --> 00:36:28,875
He'll go to the chair, as he should.

544
00:36:28,975 --> 00:36:32,555
Yeah, a man hasn't got a chance
with these New York detectives.

545
00:36:32,655 --> 00:36:36,650
Can't you put that paper down
and do the dishes?

546
00:36:52,575 --> 00:36:54,575
Adele...

547
00:36:54,735 --> 00:36:56,435
...you didn't mean what you said...

548
00:36:56,535 --> 00:36:58,235
...about giving my paintings away
to the junkman?

549
00:36:58,335 --> 00:37:00,335
You'll find out...

550
00:37:07,775 --> 00:37:10,130
Well, you won't have to.

551
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,755
A friend of mine is taking an apartment...

552
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:15,195
...in Greenwich Village,
I'll move everything there.

553
00:37:15,295 --> 00:37:18,395
Well, if he's fool enough to let you do it...

554
00:37:18,495 --> 00:37:21,725
Go ahead. The sooner the better.
- Yes.

555
00:37:24,495 --> 00:37:28,595
Top floor. You'll get plenty of light.
Lots of privacy.

556
00:37:28,695 --> 00:37:31,635
You heard of Tony Rivera,
the illustrator?

557
00:37:31,735 --> 00:37:34,155
He had this apartment
on a three-year lease.

558
00:37:34,255 --> 00:37:36,635
Couldn't work anywhere else.

559
00:37:36,815 --> 00:37:39,045
This was his studio.

560
00:37:39,975 --> 00:37:42,595
The sketches on the wall are Rivera's.

561
00:37:42,695 --> 00:37:44,395
He'd do that with his models sometimes...

562
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:47,075
...when he was working
on a magazine cover.

563
00:37:47,175 --> 00:37:49,795
Some people would pay
a lot of money for those.

564
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:52,445
Are you an artist, Miss March?

565
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,135
Where's the bedroom?
- This way.

566
00:37:59,575 --> 00:38:01,555
What's the rent, Mr. Jones?

567
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:05,155
150. There are some things that Rivera
left here stored in the basement.

568
00:38:05,255 --> 00:38:08,275
They go with the apartment if you care
to use them.

569
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:10,755
Here you are... the bedroom.

570
00:38:14,695 --> 00:38:16,990
I don't like the wallpaper.

571
00:38:17,015 --> 00:38:18,915
Will they change the paper?

572
00:38:19,015 --> 00:38:21,315
I guess so, on a year's lease.

573
00:38:21,415 --> 00:38:23,455
I'll pick it out myself.

574
00:39:13,695 --> 00:39:15,990
Well, don't break the bank.

575
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:18,955
Hello, Lazy Legs.

576
00:39:19,055 --> 00:39:21,690
I thought I heard the doorbell.

577
00:39:22,815 --> 00:39:24,815
I didn't hear anything.

578
00:39:29,615 --> 00:39:31,435
Say, is this all you've got?

579
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:36,155
I'm lucky I have that left, the way you
were throwing it around last night.

580
00:39:36,255 --> 00:39:38,075
You even bought me a book, Honey.

581
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:40,955
You're supposed to be an actress,
aren't you?

582
00:39:41,055 --> 00:39:43,520
Shakespeare, for Pete's sake.

583
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,555
Say, that's all I have left.

584
00:39:52,655 --> 00:39:56,475
You know where to get more,
don't you, Lazy Legs?

585
00:39:56,575 --> 00:40:00,515
Told me he hadn't sold any pictures
for a long time...

586
00:40:00,615 --> 00:40:03,420
And now I'm in hock for all this.

587
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,815
Look, Kitty...

588
00:40:21,855 --> 00:40:24,320
I need at least 1000 dollars.

589
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,675
Ouch.
- Well, you've got him softened up...

590
00:40:27,775 --> 00:40:29,635
Now, push him around a bit.

591
00:40:29,735 --> 00:40:32,755
He seems to get scared
when I talk about money.

592
00:40:32,855 --> 00:40:34,955
Listen Baby, you've got him
right where you want him.

593
00:40:35,055 --> 00:40:37,395
He's on the hook and can't get off.

594
00:40:37,495 --> 00:40:40,595
He can walk out, can't he?
- He's got a wife, hasn't he?

595
00:40:40,695 --> 00:40:43,075
Just drop a hint that his wife might
find out about this apartment...

596
00:40:43,175 --> 00:40:44,835
...and he'll shell out fast.

597
00:40:44,935 --> 00:40:46,355
That's blackmail...

598
00:40:46,455 --> 00:40:49,572
It's only blackmail, Baby...

599
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:53,140
...when you're dumb enough to get caught.

600
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:58,075
Is that him?
- Told you I heard the doorbell.

601
00:40:58,175 --> 00:41:01,065
For cat's sake.... Get rid of him.

602
00:41:32,415 --> 00:41:34,415
Why...

603
00:41:34,695 --> 00:41:36,155
Don't you answer doorbells?

604
00:41:36,255 --> 00:41:38,715
I thought you were mad at me.
- Peace offering...

605
00:41:38,815 --> 00:41:40,815
Scotch.
- Thanks, Honey.

606
00:41:41,215 --> 00:41:43,675
I didn't think you were out,
it's only 10 past 12.

607
00:41:43,775 --> 00:41:47,075
I rang and rang downstairs
and then I found the door was open.

608
00:41:47,175 --> 00:41:49,175
Well, well, well.

609
00:41:51,535 --> 00:41:53,235
You're doing all right for a working girl.

610
00:41:53,335 --> 00:41:55,630
Now don't start that again.

611
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,915
Don't tell me he's under the sofa, too.

612
00:42:03,015 --> 00:42:05,015
No, Bright Eyes.

613
00:42:06,215 --> 00:42:08,340
You can come out, Johnny.

614
00:42:08,575 --> 00:42:11,890
All you have to do is call, Funny Face.

615
00:42:14,095 --> 00:42:16,235
You must have made a killing in
Wall Street, Mr. Prince...

616
00:42:16,335 --> 00:42:18,335
Could be.

617
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,915
The last time I saw Johnny he was
talking about going to Hollywood.

618
00:42:21,015 --> 00:42:22,635
I might try it yet.

619
00:42:22,735 --> 00:42:26,315
I read in a movie magazine about a fella
who landed in Hollywood stone broke...

620
00:42:26,415 --> 00:42:28,915
...and cleaned up a million.
No experience, either.

621
00:42:29,015 --> 00:42:32,515
All he had was looks, and he
worked in a drugstore.

622
00:42:32,615 --> 00:42:34,795
If he worked, Johnny,
he didn't look like you.

623
00:42:34,895 --> 00:42:37,475
Will you two stop fighting?
- I'm not fighting, Baby.

624
00:42:37,575 --> 00:42:39,315
She just doesn't know my speed.

625
00:42:39,415 --> 00:42:40,715
Why, I hear of movie actors...

626
00:42:40,815 --> 00:42:42,635
...getting 5000... 10,000 a week.

627
00:42:42,735 --> 00:42:44,035
For what?

628
00:42:44,135 --> 00:42:46,595
For acting tough, for pushing
girls in the face.

629
00:42:46,695 --> 00:42:48,990
What do they do I can't do?

630
00:42:49,175 --> 00:42:50,955
You're so clever, why don't you do it?

631
00:42:51,055 --> 00:42:53,520
I might, Funny Face, I might.

632
00:43:01,735 --> 00:43:02,635
Chris.

633
00:43:02,735 --> 00:43:05,235
I brought over some of my things, Kitty.

634
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:07,915
I'll bring some more tomorrow...

635
00:43:08,015 --> 00:43:10,015
The rest on Saturday.

636
00:43:13,735 --> 00:43:15,955
Oh... You have company.
- It's just Millie and Johnny.

637
00:43:16,055 --> 00:43:17,355
John...?
- You know, Millie's boyfriend.

638
00:43:17,455 --> 00:43:18,795
Come on... I want you to meet them.

639
00:43:18,895 --> 00:43:22,275
Millie, this is a friend of mine,
Mr. Cross, Miss Ray.

640
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:24,915
How do you do, Miss Ray?
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Cross.

641
00:43:25,015 --> 00:43:29,350
And... Johnny Prince.
- Glad to know you, Mr. Cross.

642
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,175
How do you do?

643
00:43:32,535 --> 00:43:34,875
Seems to me I've seen you
before somewhere...

644
00:43:34,975 --> 00:43:37,695
Could be... could be, Mr. Cross.

645
00:43:37,695 --> 00:43:39,515
Yes, I...

646
00:43:39,615 --> 00:43:43,235
I just don't seem to remember...
Maybe I'm mistaken.

647
00:43:43,335 --> 00:43:44,715
Could be.

648
00:43:44,815 --> 00:43:49,235
Well, I have to run along, kid.
- I'll go with you, sweetheart.

649
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,835
Oh, don't bother, Johnny.

650
00:43:50,935 --> 00:43:53,675
I wouldn't think of letting
you go alone... Darling.

651
00:43:53,775 --> 00:43:57,005
You might get run over by a streetcar.

652
00:43:59,975 --> 00:44:03,035
Goodbye, Mr. Cross. Nice to see you.

653
00:44:03,615 --> 00:44:06,595
Thanks for the scotch, Millie.
- That's okay... Bye.

654
00:44:06,695 --> 00:44:09,500
So long, Kitty.
- So long, Johnny.

655
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:15,840
Now what's the matter, Chris?

656
00:44:16,055 --> 00:44:18,915
I don't think I like that young man
she's in love with.

657
00:44:19,015 --> 00:44:20,595
Oh, Johnny's all right...

658
00:44:20,695 --> 00:44:23,795
Oh, I know he is, or he wouldn't
be a friend, but...

659
00:44:23,895 --> 00:44:28,910
There's something about him that...
- She's crazy about him.

660
00:44:29,175 --> 00:44:32,675
Would you... Would you like
to see my pictures?

661
00:44:32,775 --> 00:44:35,325
Not yet. Come sit down, Chris.

662
00:44:38,615 --> 00:44:40,395
You happy?

663
00:44:40,495 --> 00:44:44,150
For the first time in my life.
- Very happy?

664
00:44:44,935 --> 00:44:46,635
I think of you all the time.

665
00:44:46,735 --> 00:44:50,125
All I want is to see you, be near you.

666
00:44:52,495 --> 00:44:54,515
I know I haven't any right
to ask you this, but...

667
00:44:54,615 --> 00:44:56,731
Have you ever...?

668
00:44:59,135 --> 00:45:02,875
Well... there must have been
other men who...

669
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:06,935
Just one, Chris.

670
00:45:07,535 --> 00:45:09,535
You still see him?

671
00:45:12,175 --> 00:45:14,175
I've forgotten him.

672
00:45:15,015 --> 00:45:17,905
Look, Kitty... if I were single...

673
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:20,835
...if I had no wife...
- But you have a wife.

674
00:45:20,935 --> 00:45:23,230
Yes I know, but if she'd...

675
00:45:24,415 --> 00:45:29,430
Well... if something would happen
that would make me free...

676
00:45:29,535 --> 00:45:31,075
Would you marry me?

677
00:45:31,175 --> 00:45:33,075
Oh, let's not talk about it now, dear.

678
00:45:33,175 --> 00:45:34,875
What I'm worried about is getting a job.

679
00:45:34,975 --> 00:45:37,195
Living like this... it's expensive.

680
00:45:37,295 --> 00:45:39,715
I don't like to ask you for anything more...

681
00:45:39,815 --> 00:45:43,995
...because... well, you say you haven't
sold any pictures lately.

682
00:45:44,095 --> 00:45:45,755
Yes, but... don't you have enough money?

683
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:48,195
You have no idea what a problem
money is for an actress, Chris.

684
00:45:48,295 --> 00:45:51,155
Talent doesn't count in the theatre.
Everything is pull.

685
00:45:51,255 --> 00:45:52,635
Contacts, knowing the right people...

686
00:45:52,735 --> 00:45:54,835
You have to get an agent...
they charge plenty...

687
00:45:54,935 --> 00:45:59,515
Wear smart clothes, be attractive.
- But Kitty, you're beautiful.

688
00:45:59,615 --> 00:46:03,210
Chris, your face doesn't mean a thing.

689
00:46:03,655 --> 00:46:07,155
It's clothes, perfumes,
making the right impression.

690
00:46:07,255 --> 00:46:10,235
Why, an actress needs 1000 dollars
just to get a decent wardrobe.

691
00:46:10,335 --> 00:46:12,724
1000 dollars?
- At least.

692
00:46:12,815 --> 00:46:17,715
Maybe I can borrow it from Millie.
Or her boyfriend... Johnny.

693
00:46:17,815 --> 00:46:19,940
He's got plenty of money.

694
00:46:20,135 --> 00:46:23,535
Oh... No, no, no, Kitty.
Not from Johnny.

695
00:46:24,295 --> 00:46:26,295
Why not?

696
00:46:26,735 --> 00:46:29,625
I'll get you the money some way...

697
00:46:30,175 --> 00:46:32,450
Chris, you're a darling.

698
00:46:32,815 --> 00:46:35,435
I really believe you're in love with me.

699
00:46:35,535 --> 00:46:37,535
I am, Kitty, I am.

700
00:46:40,415 --> 00:46:43,213
Chris, you're a caveman.

701
00:46:43,495 --> 00:46:46,555
I like you to like me...
well... there's a limit.

702
00:46:46,655 --> 00:46:48,655
Yes, I know...

703
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:53,595
I've got to go,
I'm supposed to be back...

704
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,715
I'll come here tomorrow at noon, Kitty.

705
00:46:55,815 --> 00:47:00,150
I'll be waiting for you.
I'm sorry you have to go...

706
00:47:03,215 --> 00:47:05,215
Bye-bye, Dear.

707
00:47:08,175 --> 00:47:11,320
Don't forget the money.
- I'll get it.

708
00:47:14,935 --> 00:47:17,060
Bye-bye, Chris.
- Goodbye.

709
00:48:05,055 --> 00:48:07,055
I don't get it.

710
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:08,955
The poor sap must be a hophead, seeing...

711
00:48:09,055 --> 00:48:11,055
...snakes on the 'L'.

712
00:48:12,535 --> 00:48:15,515
Imagine anyone paying
money for this stuff?

713
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:18,891
Say, are you sure he's not a phony?

714
00:48:19,655 --> 00:48:22,035
He's too dumb to be a phony.

715
00:48:22,095 --> 00:48:25,475
You're right there.
- Then how did he get all the money?

716
00:48:25,575 --> 00:48:29,515
Why, if he had to work for a living,
he couldn't make 50 dollars a week.

717
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,765
You just don't know art.

718
00:48:31,895 --> 00:48:34,875
Maybe not, but I'm gonna find out about it.

719
00:48:34,975 --> 00:48:36,975
I kinda like this one.

720
00:48:37,335 --> 00:48:40,555
But where would you find flowers like that?

721
00:48:40,655 --> 00:48:42,835
I wonder if I couldn't sell these.

722
00:48:42,935 --> 00:48:45,355
And what do I do when
he asks where they are?

723
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:46,995
Say you put them in storage.

724
00:48:47,095 --> 00:48:48,395
You know, you got to protect him...

725
00:48:48,495 --> 00:48:50,195
You can't leave valuable
paintings lying around...

726
00:48:50,295 --> 00:48:51,835
...where somebody can pick them up.

727
00:48:51,935 --> 00:48:56,440
You'd get in trouble.
Any gallery would know his work.

728
00:48:56,535 --> 00:49:00,435
He tried to kiss me today...
and don't think I liked it.

729
00:49:00,535 --> 00:49:02,795
Oh, you've been kissed before.

730
00:49:02,895 --> 00:49:05,530
Say... they're not even signed.

731
00:49:06,255 --> 00:49:08,035
That doesn't matter, they'd know them.

732
00:49:08,135 --> 00:49:09,755
Not where I take them, Baby.

733
00:49:09,855 --> 00:49:14,530
Johnny... I can't stand to
have anyone touch me but you.

734
00:49:14,855 --> 00:49:17,275
I hate him when he looks at me like that.

735
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:21,755
If he were mean or vicious or
if he bawled me out I'd like him better.

736
00:49:21,855 --> 00:49:23,555
You don't love me,

737
00:49:23,655 --> 00:49:25,835
or you'd understand what I mean.

738
00:49:25,935 --> 00:49:27,935
No?
- No.

739
00:49:39,375 --> 00:49:40,995
No?

740
00:49:41,095 --> 00:49:43,290
Well... maybe.

741
00:49:49,935 --> 00:49:51,715
Working late tonight, Mr. Cross?

742
00:49:51,815 --> 00:49:54,395
I'm about through, Ben,
you can let me out in a minute.

743
00:49:54,495 --> 00:49:56,495
Yes, sir.

744
00:50:26,975 --> 00:50:29,185
I just caught you in time.

745
00:50:40,215 --> 00:50:43,475
Cash this for me, will you, Chris?
It's personal.

746
00:50:43,575 --> 00:50:46,408
Yes, yes... Yes, of course, JJ.

747
00:51:09,055 --> 00:51:10,795
Here you are, JJ.
- Thank you, Chris.

748
00:51:10,895 --> 00:51:13,105
Good night.
Good night, JJ.

749
00:51:23,255 --> 00:51:25,255
Hello, Nick.
- Hi.

750
00:51:35,975 --> 00:51:37,975
What do you got?

751
00:51:38,975 --> 00:51:44,245
The fellow who paints those gets
50 grand for a single picture.

752
00:51:45,615 --> 00:51:48,035
Hey. What's the matter with you, Nick?

753
00:51:48,135 --> 00:51:50,675
Where'd you pick them up...
over in Washington Square?

754
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:52,795
The Village long-hairs are
peddling junk like that...

755
00:51:52,895 --> 00:51:54,355
...for the price of the canvas.

756
00:51:54,455 --> 00:51:57,475
These weren't painted by
any Village long-hair.

757
00:51:57,575 --> 00:51:59,835
That's my pawnshop, isn't it?

758
00:51:59,935 --> 00:52:02,955
And that snake is strictly from the Bronx.

759
00:52:03,055 --> 00:52:05,195
This fellow lives in Brooklyn.
He's famous.

760
00:52:05,295 --> 00:52:07,395
Yeah, what's his name?
- Well, I...

761
00:52:07,495 --> 00:52:10,955
Nick, I've brought you stuff before
and you never asked for any name on it.

762
00:52:11,055 --> 00:52:15,635
That was jewelry. Bring me some more
of that and we can do business, Johnny.

763
00:52:15,735 --> 00:52:20,580
Take this junk back to Washington Square
where you got it.

764
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:01,835
I can see you've got an eye for art.

765
00:53:02,175 --> 00:53:04,175
That's one of my best.

766
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:06,375
Take a look at these...

767
00:53:06,775 --> 00:53:08,875
I didn't know you were a painter.

768
00:53:08,975 --> 00:53:10,975
I'm not.

769
00:53:14,695 --> 00:53:16,990
Are they any good?
- Well...

770
00:53:17,335 --> 00:53:19,460
...they've got something.

771
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:22,255
A certain peculiar...

772
00:53:22,935 --> 00:53:25,740
...something. But no perspective.

773
00:53:25,775 --> 00:53:28,195
Is that important?
- I should say it is.

774
00:53:28,295 --> 00:53:30,295
Look at my paintings.

775
00:53:30,575 --> 00:53:31,915
Where did you buy them?

776
00:53:32,015 --> 00:53:33,715
I didn't buy them,
I want to sell them.

777
00:53:33,815 --> 00:53:35,515
You want me to sell them on commission?

778
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:39,115
How much do you think they're worth?
- I always start everything at 25.

779
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:42,675
Then... you know, it's a hard
business selling pictures.

780
00:53:42,775 --> 00:53:45,325
People don't buy art nowadays.

781
00:53:45,535 --> 00:53:48,475
No appreciation, no taste,
no perception...

782
00:53:48,575 --> 00:53:50,575
No perspective, huh?

783
00:53:54,255 --> 00:53:56,315
Let me have your name and address.

784
00:53:56,415 --> 00:53:59,135
I'll come back later... So long.

785
00:54:05,655 --> 00:54:07,950
Hello, Johnny.
- Hiya, Tiny.

786
00:54:10,335 --> 00:54:12,335
Where'd you get that?

787
00:54:13,495 --> 00:54:14,755
Off Nick.

788
00:54:14,855 --> 00:54:16,855
What about my ring?

789
00:54:17,415 --> 00:54:20,995
You know how much a good diamond
costs? - I gave you 900 dollars.

790
00:54:21,095 --> 00:54:23,095
Will you pipe down?

791
00:54:30,415 --> 00:54:33,475
You've been telling me what a dope
the old guy is...

792
00:54:33,575 --> 00:54:35,575
Maybe you're the dope.

793
00:54:36,855 --> 00:54:39,595
He told you his paintings
are worth a lot of money...

794
00:54:39,695 --> 00:54:42,875
Did you check up on his story?
- What's wrong with it?

795
00:54:42,975 --> 00:54:46,715
They're worth just 25 bucks apiece.
That's what's wrong with it.

796
00:54:46,815 --> 00:54:48,815
You're crazy.

797
00:54:50,015 --> 00:54:52,875
If I weren't a gentleman...
- Well don't get sore.

798
00:54:52,975 --> 00:54:55,865
Well then don't tell me I'm crazy.

799
00:55:01,455 --> 00:55:03,875
I tell you the old boy's a phony.

800
00:55:03,975 --> 00:55:05,595
His money isn't phony, is it?

801
00:55:05,695 --> 00:55:08,435
He could borrow dough, or
have it stashed away...

802
00:55:08,535 --> 00:55:10,555
Or even steal it.
- Chris steal?

803
00:55:10,655 --> 00:55:12,675
Jeepers, Johnny, he's not the type.

804
00:55:12,775 --> 00:55:14,275
He wouldn't have nerve enough to steal.

805
00:55:14,375 --> 00:55:15,955
Well he didn't get it from his pictures.

806
00:55:16,055 --> 00:55:17,795
He may be dumb, but not about art.

807
00:55:17,895 --> 00:55:19,700
The day he took me to the museum he
explained to me how everything was done.

808
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,755
You should have heard him. People stood
around and listened.

809
00:55:23,855 --> 00:55:26,355
What museum?
- The Metropolitan.

810
00:55:26,455 --> 00:55:31,045
Yipe. They've got pictures there
worth a million bucks.

811
00:55:34,935 --> 00:55:36,935
Where you going?

812
00:55:41,695 --> 00:55:43,795
I'm going to make a money
out of you, Lazy Legs.

813
00:55:43,895 --> 00:55:45,875
You can't take his pictures to the museum.

814
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:47,975
Who says I can't?

815
00:56:02,295 --> 00:56:03,915
You know who bought them?

816
00:56:04,015 --> 00:56:07,166
Janeway. Damon Janeway.

817
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:10,195
Don't you know who Mr. Janeway is?
- No.

818
00:56:10,295 --> 00:56:12,295
He's an art critic.

819
00:56:12,295 --> 00:56:15,475
The best authority in New York
on Modern Art.

820
00:56:15,575 --> 00:56:17,795
He took one look and bought them both.

821
00:56:17,895 --> 00:56:19,915
I couldn't even give him my pictures.

822
00:56:20,015 --> 00:56:21,155
Not for nothing.

823
00:56:21,255 --> 00:56:22,955
He wants to get hold of you.

824
00:56:23,055 --> 00:56:25,635
He told me to telephone him.
You wait here, eh?

825
00:56:25,735 --> 00:56:27,735
No, no...

826
00:56:42,215 --> 00:56:44,215
Sorry...

827
00:56:47,055 --> 00:56:49,235
For cat's sake, what's so funny?

828
00:56:49,335 --> 00:56:51,335
You are, Smarty-Pants.

829
00:56:51,655 --> 00:56:54,235
You're the Mr. Fix-It who was gonna
make a monkey...

830
00:56:54,335 --> 00:56:57,035
...out of poor dopey little Kitty...

831
00:56:57,135 --> 00:56:59,835
So you gave away two pictures
for a couple of dimes...

832
00:56:59,935 --> 00:57:04,075
...and now you can't collect the dimes.
- Oh dry up.

833
00:57:04,175 --> 00:57:06,769
Jeepers.
- Now what?

834
00:57:06,855 --> 00:57:09,275
What am I gonna tell Chris?
- He won't find out.

835
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,555
The heck he won't.
That Janeway's a crític...

836
00:57:11,655 --> 00:57:13,075
...he writes for the newspaper.

837
00:57:13,175 --> 00:57:15,995
Golly, you got us in a spot.
I told you not to do it.

838
00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:17,235
You're just nervous.

839
00:57:17,335 --> 00:57:19,475
The old guy that sold them
doesn't know me from Adam.

840
00:57:19,575 --> 00:57:22,380
Give me that drink, I can use it.

841
00:57:25,815 --> 00:57:28,773
Chris?
- No, he's got a key.

842
00:57:30,615 --> 00:57:33,845
Well go ahead, see who it is.
Hurry up.

843
00:57:44,895 --> 00:57:46,155
I beg your pardon, but...

844
00:57:46,255 --> 00:57:48,635
...we're looking for a man,
and I'm afraid we don't know his name.

845
00:57:48,735 --> 00:57:51,455
And I'm afraid I can't help you.

846
00:57:52,655 --> 00:57:53,915
I'm sorry...

847
00:57:54,015 --> 00:57:56,015
Look.

848
00:57:59,135 --> 00:58:01,135
There.

849
00:58:03,335 --> 00:58:05,335
These are his.

850
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,675
Oh, there he is.

851
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:11,090
Why did you run away from me like that?

852
00:58:11,335 --> 00:58:14,452
Here, 50 dollars less 20 percent.

853
00:58:14,535 --> 00:58:16,195
I don't know what you're talking about.

854
00:58:16,295 --> 00:58:17,595
But the pictures you brought me.

855
00:58:17,695 --> 00:58:20,395
Perhaps we'd better introduce ourselves:
My name is Janeway.

856
00:58:20,495 --> 00:58:22,475
This is Mr. Dellarowe.
- How do you do?

857
00:58:22,575 --> 00:58:23,755
What is it you want?

858
00:58:23,855 --> 00:58:26,515
We'd like to find out
who painted the pictures.

859
00:58:26,615 --> 00:58:29,235
You don't know?
- Of course they don't know.

860
00:58:29,335 --> 00:58:31,035
That's what we're here for.

861
00:58:31,135 --> 00:58:33,035
Look, if you're a friend of the painter,

862
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:34,635
you'll put Mr. Dellarowe in touch with him.

863
00:58:34,735 --> 00:58:37,835
Why'd you buy those pictures if you
didn't know who painted them?

864
00:58:37,935 --> 00:58:41,335
Because they're good.
- Who painted them?

865
00:58:49,095 --> 00:58:50,915
No, Johnny, no.

866
00:58:51,015 --> 00:58:53,275
Oh don't be so modest, Miss March.

867
00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:55,235
Now you see? You got me in bad.

868
00:58:55,335 --> 00:58:57,235
She made me promise not to tell.

869
00:58:57,335 --> 00:59:00,820
That's why I made out like I didn't know.

870
00:59:01,815 --> 00:59:04,075
She's funny about her painting.

871
00:59:04,175 --> 00:59:08,115
Never lets anyone see it. Doesn't
even put her name on her pictures.

872
00:59:08,215 --> 00:59:09,395
So I observed.

873
00:59:09,495 --> 00:59:11,315
You're an extraordinary artist,
Miss March.

874
00:59:11,415 --> 00:59:12,995
Oh, no.
- See?

875
00:59:13,095 --> 00:59:15,075
She can't stand for anybody
to talk about her.

876
00:59:15,175 --> 00:59:17,395
She got the idea her pictures
weren't any good.

877
00:59:17,495 --> 00:59:19,195
That's why I took those two to you...

878
00:59:19,295 --> 00:59:22,915
...to give her confidence...
I knew they were good.

879
00:59:23,015 --> 00:59:24,755
Now I'll take that money.

880
00:59:24,855 --> 00:59:27,475
I never would have guessed
it was a woman.

881
00:59:27,575 --> 00:59:30,035
Nor I... You're work is
very strong, Miss March.

882
00:59:30,135 --> 00:59:32,475
May we see some more of it?
- Sure... go ahead.

883
00:59:32,575 --> 00:59:35,210
Look in her studio.
- Thank you.

884
00:59:40,735 --> 00:59:43,115
You're crazy to try a thing like this.

885
00:59:43,215 --> 00:59:45,275
For cat's sake,
I thought they were cops.

886
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:47,475
I know what I'm doing...
they don't know from nothing.

887
00:59:47,575 --> 00:59:48,955
I can't fool that crític.

888
00:59:49,055 --> 00:59:51,435
You always wanted to be an actress...
Now's your chance.

889
00:59:51,535 --> 00:59:54,315
You've been around the old boy
long enough to pick up his lingo...

890
00:59:54,415 --> 00:59:57,475
Feed Janeway some of that... I'll get
him in here alone with you.

891
00:59:57,575 --> 00:59:59,575
No, no... wait.

892
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,515
How long has she been painting?

893
01:00:05,615 --> 01:00:07,400
Ever since she was a kid, Mr. Janeway.

894
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:11,395
Never went to art school, did she?
- No, she just picked it up...

895
01:00:11,495 --> 01:00:12,875
I guess I'm the only one who's...

896
01:00:12,975 --> 01:00:14,915
...been encouraging her, kind of...

897
01:00:15,015 --> 01:00:18,395
Helping her along... as a friend...
You know, just a friend.

898
01:00:18,495 --> 01:00:21,400
I didn't get your name.
- Prince.

899
01:00:24,015 --> 01:00:27,768
Say Mr. Janeway... she's kind of upset.

900
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:31,490
Maybe you'd go in and talk to her?

901
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,100
Be glad to.

902
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:41,100
Well, Mr. Dellarowe?

903
01:00:43,935 --> 01:00:47,300
I wonder if Miss March would
let me have all of these?

904
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,500
Well that depends...

905
01:00:49,775 --> 01:00:52,400
What's in it for her?

906
01:00:52,535 --> 01:00:56,785
Prices will have to be built up,
Mr. Prince, but...

907
01:01:06,355 --> 01:01:08,215
I can usually tell whether a canvas...

908
01:01:08,315 --> 01:01:10,695
...has been painted by a man or woman...

909
01:01:10,795 --> 01:01:12,750
But you fooled me completely,
Miss March.

910
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:16,300
Your work is not only original,
but has a masculine force.

911
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:20,140
How long does it take you
to paint a picture?

912
01:01:21,355 --> 01:01:25,109
Sometimes a day... sometimes a year.

913
01:01:25,875 --> 01:01:28,775
You can't tell, it has to grow.
- Of course.

914
01:01:28,875 --> 01:01:31,135
It's a matter of feeling, you know...

915
01:01:31,235 --> 01:01:34,125
...how feeling grows? It's like...

916
01:01:34,675 --> 01:01:37,225
Like falling in love, I guess.

917
01:01:39,755 --> 01:01:41,295
That's a very good description.

918
01:01:41,395 --> 01:01:45,735
The way I look at it... Every painting,
if it's any good, is...

919
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:47,835
...a love affair.

920
01:01:48,195 --> 01:01:49,975
May I quote that?
- Oh, no, no...

921
01:01:50,075 --> 01:01:51,535
Please don't write about me.

922
01:01:51,635 --> 01:01:54,535
I can see you're going to be
a very hard case.

923
01:01:54,635 --> 01:01:57,415
Why don't you have confidence
in your work?

924
01:01:57,515 --> 01:01:59,335
Because I can't draw.

925
01:01:59,435 --> 01:02:00,775
You do all right.

926
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:02,775
I just put a line around what I feel...

927
01:02:02,875 --> 01:02:05,000
...when I look at things.

928
01:02:06,275 --> 01:02:08,735
You're a very stimulating person to talk to.

929
01:02:08,835 --> 01:02:11,385
How are you two getting along?

930
01:02:12,275 --> 01:02:13,535
I think I'm breaking the ice.

931
01:02:13,635 --> 01:02:15,175
Kitty, Mr. Dellarowe wants to...

932
01:02:15,275 --> 01:02:18,695
...handle all your work exclusively...
Is it all right?

933
01:02:18,795 --> 01:02:20,655
As a friend I'd advise it.

934
01:02:20,755 --> 01:02:22,375
Could you come to the galleries tomorrow?

935
01:02:22,475 --> 01:02:25,790
What time?
- Any time that's convenient.

936
01:02:25,955 --> 01:02:27,335
How about twelve o'clock?

937
01:02:27,435 --> 01:02:29,215
And then lunch afterward with me.

938
01:02:29,315 --> 01:02:31,704
Well, I...

939
01:02:32,435 --> 01:02:34,435
She'll be there.

940
01:02:34,875 --> 01:02:38,815
I'm glad you're around, Mr. Prince,
to make up her mind for her.

941
01:02:38,915 --> 01:02:40,615
I can see you're tired, Miss March.

942
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:42,335
This has been enough for one evening.

943
01:02:42,435 --> 01:02:44,135
We'd better go. Until tomorrow?

944
01:02:44,235 --> 01:02:46,870
Thanks, Mr. Janeway... so long.

945
01:02:47,075 --> 01:02:48,335
Good evening.

946
01:02:48,435 --> 01:02:51,750
Good night, Mr. Dellarowe.
- Good night.

947
01:02:56,835 --> 01:02:58,875
Good night.
- Good night.

948
01:03:04,635 --> 01:03:06,635
Lazy Legs...

949
01:03:08,315 --> 01:03:09,775
I don't know what you told Janeway...

950
01:03:09,875 --> 01:03:11,375
...but you've got him eating
right out of your hand.

951
01:03:11,475 --> 01:03:13,175
It won't stop with lunch...

952
01:03:13,275 --> 01:03:15,655
Well, what's the difference?
- If you mean...

953
01:03:15,755 --> 01:03:18,560
Oh, stop acting like a green kid.

954
01:03:20,035 --> 01:03:23,415
Let him talk about what he wants to
talk about, and he won't talk about art.

955
01:03:23,515 --> 01:03:26,830
If I had any sense I'd walk out on you.

956
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:29,110
You haven't got any sense.

957
01:03:45,995 --> 01:03:49,215
Right here... just like you'd sign a letter.

958
01:03:49,315 --> 01:03:51,315
Come on.

959
01:03:52,355 --> 01:03:54,395
Katherine March.
- Kitty?

960
01:03:54,835 --> 01:03:57,980
For cat's sake.... Put that one back.

961
01:03:57,995 --> 01:03:59,995
Kitty?

962
01:04:01,955 --> 01:04:06,290
Chris. - Oh, Kitty,
I happened to be in the neigh...

963
01:04:07,555 --> 01:04:10,627
Hello, Mr. Cross, I just dropped in.

964
01:04:10,715 --> 01:04:12,925
I thought Millie was here.

965
01:04:13,275 --> 01:04:16,375
Say, I hope you don't mind me
looking at your picture?

966
01:04:16,475 --> 01:04:18,735
Oh no, not at all, Mr. Prince.

967
01:04:18,835 --> 01:04:22,065
Fine work, that's remarkable painting.

968
01:04:22,235 --> 01:04:24,375
You have a little trouble with
perspective, don't you?

969
01:04:24,475 --> 01:04:28,855
Yes, that's one thing I could
never master: Perspective.

970
01:04:28,955 --> 01:04:31,255
Well, I guess I'll have to run along.

971
01:04:31,355 --> 01:04:32,895
So long, Mr. Cross.

972
01:04:32,995 --> 01:04:35,135
If Millie drops in, tell her
I'll be at Tiny's place.

973
01:04:35,235 --> 01:04:38,125
Don't bother, I'll let myself out.

974
01:04:45,635 --> 01:04:47,415
Has he been here long?

975
01:04:47,515 --> 01:04:49,515
No, why?

976
01:04:49,675 --> 01:04:52,375
I don't like him. - Johnny's all right
He's a nice fellow, Chris. Really he is.

977
01:04:52,475 --> 01:04:55,535
I don't know why you don't like him.

978
01:04:55,635 --> 01:04:57,635
Well... was he the one?

979
01:04:58,235 --> 01:04:59,815
One what?

980
01:04:59,915 --> 01:05:01,135
Well you said there was one man...

981
01:05:01,235 --> 01:05:02,855
Oh for heaven's sake, won't you
ever forget that?

982
01:05:02,955 --> 01:05:04,095
Was he?
- No.

983
01:05:04,195 --> 01:05:05,415
Kitty...
- Go ahead and paint if you want to...

984
01:05:05,515 --> 01:05:10,530
I'm not going to stick around if
you're going to torment me.

985
01:05:44,155 --> 01:05:46,155
Kitty...

986
01:05:47,155 --> 01:05:48,615
Oh, Kitty...

987
01:05:48,715 --> 01:05:52,455
Oh, leave me alone,
I'm going out for dinner.

988
01:05:55,555 --> 01:05:56,935
Kitty, don't be angry.

989
01:05:57,035 --> 01:05:59,575
Why do you come here if you want to
quarrel? I didn't ask you to come here.

990
01:05:59,675 --> 01:06:01,675
Oh, please Kitty.

991
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:03,655
Oh, for Pete's sake.

992
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:06,349
Go and paint.
- I can't.

993
01:06:06,635 --> 01:06:10,375
I can't do a thing when
you're angry with me.

994
01:06:12,235 --> 01:06:14,235
Do you want me to go?

995
01:06:14,315 --> 01:06:17,205
I want you to stay here and paint.

996
01:06:26,275 --> 01:06:28,935
Chris... I'm sorry, Chris, but...

997
01:06:29,035 --> 01:06:32,095
...why do you torment me about something
that's over and done with?

998
01:06:32,195 --> 01:06:34,195
Well, because I...

999
01:06:35,755 --> 01:06:38,390
Would you marry me?
- You can't.

1000
01:06:39,075 --> 01:06:41,095
Well, something might happen.
- What?

1001
01:06:41,195 --> 01:06:44,295
You better not let your wife
hear you talking like that.

1002
01:06:44,395 --> 01:06:46,975
Of course I'd marry you if
you were free, but...

1003
01:06:47,075 --> 01:06:50,135
You're not, so... Let's not talk
about it. Now you go on and paint.

1004
01:06:50,235 --> 01:06:52,235
Could I paint you?

1005
01:06:54,075 --> 01:06:57,730
Well, I was going to do this myself, but...

1006
01:06:59,995 --> 01:07:01,995
Paint me, Chris.

1007
01:07:12,755 --> 01:07:14,880
There'll be masterpieces.

1008
01:07:59,555 --> 01:08:01,095
Hello, Adele.

1009
01:08:01,195 --> 01:08:03,895
I dropped over to the butcher shop
like you told me to.

1010
01:08:03,995 --> 01:08:06,800
They got a nice piece of liver...

1011
01:08:10,595 --> 01:08:13,995
How long have you
known Katherine March?

1012
01:08:14,115 --> 01:08:16,115
Answer me.

1013
01:08:19,675 --> 01:08:23,655
I don't know what you're talking
about. - How long have you known her?

1014
01:08:23,755 --> 01:08:26,295
Well now, don't get excited,
let me help you off with your coat.

1015
01:08:26,395 --> 01:08:29,735
You're the one who's excited... Look
at you. And keep away with that knife.

1016
01:08:29,835 --> 01:08:32,045
You want to cut my throat?

1017
01:08:35,155 --> 01:08:37,535
How long have you known her?

1018
01:08:38,235 --> 01:08:41,015
I don't know what you're talking about
- Don't lie to me.

1019
01:08:41,115 --> 01:08:43,095
You've been copying her work for years.

1020
01:08:43,195 --> 01:08:45,175
Pretending you painted those pictures
out of your own head and all the time...

1021
01:08:45,275 --> 01:08:47,255
...you were just copying the work
of a real artist.

1022
01:08:47,355 --> 01:08:50,335
I'll bet you're at Dellarowe's
every day making notes.

1023
01:08:50,435 --> 01:08:52,435
Where?
- You know where.

1024
01:08:52,515 --> 01:08:54,975
Dellarowe's Art Gallery in 57th Street.

1025
01:08:55,075 --> 01:08:58,455
They've got a window full of
paintings by Katherine March.

1026
01:08:58,555 --> 01:08:59,655
You're talking crazy.

1027
01:08:59,755 --> 01:09:03,735
She gets 500 dollars for a single
picture. She's a genius.

1028
01:09:03,835 --> 01:09:05,615
No wonder I used to think sometimes...

1029
01:09:05,715 --> 01:09:09,855
...there was something in your work...
Now I know why.

1030
01:09:09,955 --> 01:09:11,535
If you ever do any more
painting around here

1031
01:09:11,635 --> 01:09:13,095
I swear I'll write that woman a letter...

1032
01:09:13,195 --> 01:09:16,535
...telling her you're stealing her ideas.

1033
01:09:16,635 --> 01:09:18,635
You're a thief.

1034
01:09:19,075 --> 01:09:25,365
Hogarth had better watch out... Or next
thing you'll be stealing his money.

1035
01:09:29,675 --> 01:09:31,335
Not that one, Honey.

1036
01:09:31,435 --> 01:09:33,695
Dellarowe's asking for more pictures...

1037
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:35,975
Chris just finished it, he'll miss it.

1038
01:09:36,075 --> 01:09:38,895
Janeway says the new pictures are...

1039
01:09:38,995 --> 01:09:41,630
...the best things you've done.

1040
01:09:43,555 --> 01:09:45,815
Wasn't I right about Janeway,
Lazy Legs?

1041
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:47,575
Yeah, but he gets on my nerves.

1042
01:09:47,675 --> 01:09:49,935
I been out to dinner with him
three times this week...

1043
01:09:50,035 --> 01:09:52,775
...and now he's talking about breakfast.

1044
01:09:52,875 --> 01:09:54,695
He's getting that look in his eye...

1045
01:09:54,795 --> 01:09:56,775
All you gotta do is keep it there.

1046
01:09:56,875 --> 01:09:59,015
It's all very well for you to say...

1047
01:09:59,115 --> 01:10:01,175
...but what about the wear and
tear on my nerves?

1048
01:10:01,275 --> 01:10:03,740
Papa will take care of Kitty.

1049
01:10:03,955 --> 01:10:07,270
Baby's gonna have a big diamond ring...

1050
01:10:07,595 --> 01:10:09,535
...and a shiny limousine...

1051
01:10:09,635 --> 01:10:12,355
...and a penthouse.
- And Johnny?

1052
01:10:12,995 --> 01:10:15,290
He goes with the penthouse.

1053
01:10:26,195 --> 01:10:28,195
Chris...

1054
01:10:30,435 --> 01:10:34,430
How did my pictures get into
Dellarowe's window?

1055
01:10:37,515 --> 01:10:39,515
Oh, Chris.

1056
01:10:39,555 --> 01:10:41,680
Don't be angry with me...

1057
01:10:42,595 --> 01:10:45,415
No I'm not angry,
I just can't understand.

1058
01:10:45,515 --> 01:10:47,015
It's not possible.

1059
01:10:47,115 --> 01:10:49,095
Forgive me, Darling, I...

1060
01:10:49,195 --> 01:10:52,615
I needed money. They were
going to take the furniture back.

1061
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:54,095
It was humiliating...

1062
01:10:54,195 --> 01:10:58,015
I couldn't ask you for more,
you've been so generous.

1063
01:10:58,115 --> 01:11:01,824
I just couldn't.
So I sold some pictures.

1064
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:04,675
To Dellarowe?
- Yes.

1065
01:11:06,075 --> 01:11:07,815
You actually sold those pictures?

1066
01:11:07,915 --> 01:11:09,535
Yes.

1067
01:11:09,635 --> 01:11:13,215
I know I shouldn't have
put my name on them but

1068
01:11:13,315 --> 01:11:16,335
Mr. Dellarowe wanted
to know who painted them...

1069
01:11:16,435 --> 01:11:19,535
...and I just couldn't give him your name.

1070
01:11:19,635 --> 01:11:22,295
Now I can't tell him different... can I?

1071
01:11:22,395 --> 01:11:24,015
No.

1072
01:11:24,115 --> 01:11:28,975
The funny part is that it didn't seem
to make any difference.

1073
01:11:29,075 --> 01:11:32,415
Yes, well the funny part is it
made a great deal of difference.

1074
01:11:32,515 --> 01:11:34,575
If I'd brought those pictures
to a man like Dellarowe...

1075
01:11:34,675 --> 01:11:36,615
...he wouldn't have taken them.

1076
01:11:36,715 --> 01:11:38,415
I'm a failure, Kitty.

1077
01:11:38,515 --> 01:11:41,405
Oh, you're a great painter, Chris.

1078
01:11:41,915 --> 01:11:45,655
Mr. Dellarowe said so and
so did Mr. Janeway.

1079
01:11:46,195 --> 01:11:48,195
That is...

1080
01:11:49,395 --> 01:11:52,895
...they say I am.
- Well they're gonna keep on saying it.

1081
01:11:52,995 --> 01:11:55,055
Oh, Chris.
- Oh now don't...

1082
01:11:55,155 --> 01:11:56,815
Don't Kitty, now don't cry.

1083
01:11:56,915 --> 01:11:59,215
I'm happy....
Why, it's just like a dream.

1084
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:02,227
Oh Chris, you're so good, so kind.

1085
01:12:02,395 --> 01:12:04,375
What difference does it make whose
name is on those pictures...

1086
01:12:04,475 --> 01:12:06,295
...yours or mine?

1087
01:12:06,395 --> 01:12:09,295
Why, it's just like we were married.

1088
01:12:09,395 --> 01:12:11,395
Only I take your name.

1089
01:12:11,795 --> 01:12:16,045
Well, that gives me a little
authority around here.

1090
01:12:16,595 --> 01:12:20,760
I want to paint your picture, Kitty.
How about it?

1091
01:12:24,075 --> 01:12:26,075
Come with me.

1092
01:12:46,955 --> 01:12:51,290
Know what we're going to call this?
'Self-Portrait'.

1093
01:12:51,995 --> 01:12:57,023
DELLAROWE GALLERIES
EXHIBITION OF KATHERINE MARCH...

1094
01:13:32,555 --> 01:13:34,415
Hello, Damon.
- Hello, Ned.

1095
01:13:34,515 --> 01:13:35,735
Hello.

1096
01:13:35,835 --> 01:13:38,615
Well. This is the first time that
I've ever agreed with you, Janeway.

1097
01:13:38,715 --> 01:13:39,775
Thank you.

1098
01:13:39,875 --> 01:13:43,535
I find the painter even more
fascinating than her paintings.

1099
01:13:43,635 --> 01:13:45,635
What's she like?

1100
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:49,135
Mona Lisa without the smile...
Something hidden.

1101
01:13:49,235 --> 01:13:52,175
Sometimes it seems as if she
were two people.

1102
01:13:52,275 --> 01:13:56,950
I mention that in my notice...
would you care to see it?

1103
01:14:15,475 --> 01:14:18,255
Mr. Cross, there's a man outside
who says he wants to see you.

1104
01:14:18,355 --> 01:14:19,975
Who?
- I didn't get no name, sir.

1105
01:14:20,075 --> 01:14:22,710
But he says he was a detective.

1106
01:14:49,475 --> 01:14:53,725
You the detective?
- Well, I used to be, Mr. Cross.

1107
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:56,115
Don't you recognize me?

1108
01:14:57,035 --> 01:14:59,035
No.

1109
01:15:02,155 --> 01:15:03,615
Homer.

1110
01:15:03,715 --> 01:15:05,215
Quite a shock, huh?

1111
01:15:05,315 --> 01:15:06,815
Now don't faint, Mr. Cross.

1112
01:15:06,915 --> 01:15:09,655
Keep your head.
I'll explain everything.

1113
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:12,615
Well, I was in trouble at the time,
I'd been...

1114
01:15:12,715 --> 01:15:16,375
...collecting a little money from
the speakeasies along the waterfront.

1115
01:15:16,475 --> 01:15:18,895
Word got around to headquarters.

1116
01:15:18,995 --> 01:15:21,350
I was up for investigation.

1117
01:15:21,755 --> 01:15:23,135
One night I'm down by Brooklyn Bridge...

1118
01:15:23,235 --> 01:15:25,215
...trying to fix things up...

1119
01:15:25,315 --> 01:15:27,015
A man runs into the speakeasy and says:

1120
01:15:27,115 --> 01:15:29,335
'A woman just jumped off the bridge.'

1121
01:15:29,435 --> 01:15:32,655
So I run out and tear off my coat,
jump in...

1122
01:15:32,755 --> 01:15:36,695
The way I felt, I'm hoping
I don't come up again.

1123
01:15:36,795 --> 01:15:38,795
You mind?

1124
01:15:44,875 --> 01:15:47,935
Well, there I am, swimming
around in the dark...

1125
01:15:48,035 --> 01:15:51,175
I had hold of her hat once... the next
thing I know, I'm all tired out.

1126
01:15:51,275 --> 01:15:53,535
I heard a tugboat whistle,
and right down on top of me...

1127
01:15:53,635 --> 01:15:56,229
...comes a coal barge...

1128
01:15:56,395 --> 01:15:58,695
...so I grab ahold and climb aboard.

1129
01:15:58,795 --> 01:16:02,615
I look down at my hand,
and what do you think I got?

1130
01:16:02,715 --> 01:16:04,295
Her pocketbook.

1131
01:16:04,395 --> 01:16:07,535
That's what I grabbed ahold of
when I thought it was her hat.

1132
01:16:07,635 --> 01:16:11,674
And inside is 2700 dollars in folded money.

1133
01:16:12,275 --> 01:16:16,415
Imagine anyone committing suicide
with that much money.

1134
01:16:16,515 --> 01:16:18,655
Well the coal barge unloaded
on a banana boat...

1135
01:16:18,755 --> 01:16:22,580
...bound for Honduras...
Well, I went with it.

1136
01:16:23,355 --> 01:16:25,480
But if you're not dead...

1137
01:16:26,435 --> 01:16:30,005
Then I'm not really married to Adele,
am I?

1138
01:16:33,835 --> 01:16:36,335
What's it worth it to you for me to...

1139
01:16:36,435 --> 01:16:39,135
...keep my mouth shut and just...

1140
01:16:39,235 --> 01:16:41,235
...fade away?

1141
01:16:41,435 --> 01:16:42,535
Yes but...

1142
01:16:42,635 --> 01:16:45,015
If you're Adele's husband...

1143
01:16:45,955 --> 01:16:50,460
Wait a minute. I can see you need Adele.
I need money.

1144
01:16:51,435 --> 01:16:52,615
You're a cashier...

1145
01:16:52,715 --> 01:16:56,615
...it ought to be easy for you to get
your hands on a couple of thousand...

1146
01:16:56,715 --> 01:17:00,795
Well, I... I... I couldn't do a thing like that.

1147
01:17:02,595 --> 01:17:05,015
You're going back to her?
- No.

1148
01:17:05,115 --> 01:17:07,575
But not to do you a favor, Mister.

1149
01:17:07,675 --> 01:17:10,565
I'm clearing out for Adele's sake.

1150
01:17:12,435 --> 01:17:15,335
And don't think you're gonna get
any peace of mind, either.

1151
01:17:15,435 --> 01:17:17,985
I might turn up again someday.

1152
01:17:18,515 --> 01:17:22,595
She'd kick you out in a minute
for a man like me.

1153
01:17:25,275 --> 01:17:27,315
I'll get you some money.

1154
01:17:27,555 --> 01:17:29,415
Now you're using your head.

1155
01:17:29,515 --> 01:17:31,015
But you'll have to wait here.

1156
01:17:31,115 --> 01:17:33,935
I can't get it until after we
close at six o'clock.

1157
01:17:34,035 --> 01:17:36,035
I'll wait, Cross.

1158
01:17:37,875 --> 01:17:40,095
Hello, Johnny. Hello, Kitty.
- Hiya, Marchetti.

1159
01:17:40,195 --> 01:17:42,195
Hi.

1160
01:17:43,355 --> 01:17:45,615
Don't forget the champagne, Baby.

1161
01:17:45,715 --> 01:17:48,495
Nice car you have, Johnny.
She go fast, eh?

1162
01:17:48,595 --> 01:17:51,015
I'd like to see any cop trying to catch me.

1163
01:17:51,115 --> 01:17:53,615
Say, I'll give you four bits
for a bucket full of that ice...

1164
01:17:53,715 --> 01:17:55,715
Okay, Johnny.

1165
01:18:00,755 --> 01:18:02,575
Can I borrow the icepick?

1166
01:18:02,675 --> 01:18:05,565
You give it back, eh?
- Sure, sure.

1167
01:18:07,635 --> 01:18:09,635
Thank you.

1168
01:18:12,355 --> 01:18:14,355
Only 200?

1169
01:18:14,435 --> 01:18:16,695
Well, that's all I could get.

1170
01:18:16,795 --> 01:18:20,450
Don't you think your wife's more than that?

1171
01:18:20,995 --> 01:18:25,295
Look, I want you to get all
that's coming to you, Mr. Higgins.

1172
01:18:25,395 --> 01:18:27,015
Now what about the insurance money?

1173
01:18:27,115 --> 01:18:28,095
The insurance?

1174
01:18:28,195 --> 01:18:30,709
2000 dollars... on your life.

1175
01:18:30,995 --> 01:18:34,695
Adele collected it.
It's really yours, isn't it?

1176
01:18:34,795 --> 01:18:36,575
She keeps it right in her bedroom.

1177
01:18:36,675 --> 01:18:40,055
Now I wouldn't touch a penny of it,
Mr. Higgins, but...

1178
01:18:40,155 --> 01:18:43,655
...if you took it,
it would be perfectly legal.

1179
01:18:43,755 --> 01:18:47,325
But just how would I get it?
- That's easy.

1180
01:18:48,035 --> 01:18:51,135
This is the night that she
always goes out to the movies.

1181
01:18:51,235 --> 01:18:54,466
I let you in, you take the money...

1182
01:18:55,635 --> 01:18:57,635
I let you out.

1183
01:18:59,075 --> 01:19:00,615
But why don't you get it?

1184
01:19:00,715 --> 01:19:03,935
Why, I've got to be able to
say that I didn't touch it.

1185
01:19:04,035 --> 01:19:06,035
You know Adele...

1186
01:19:09,915 --> 01:19:12,210
What if she don't go out...

1187
01:19:12,515 --> 01:19:16,765
...and I show up...
Your goose is cooked, isn't it?

1188
01:19:17,035 --> 01:19:19,035
Yes, but...

1189
01:19:19,675 --> 01:19:21,950
I can play it safe.
- How?

1190
01:19:22,875 --> 01:19:27,550
Well, you come along the street
at 11 o'clock tonight...

1191
01:20:14,555 --> 01:20:15,935
Okay?

1192
01:20:16,035 --> 01:20:18,695
Why are you whispering?
How come the lights are out?

1193
01:20:18,795 --> 01:20:22,535
Mrs. Michaels. You remember
Mrs. Michaels, don't you?

1194
01:20:22,635 --> 01:20:25,100
Oh, yeah.
- And the neighbors.

1195
01:20:32,195 --> 01:20:33,575
Where is the money?

1196
01:20:33,675 --> 01:20:37,585
In there... in the bottom drawer of the chest.

1197
01:20:38,955 --> 01:20:41,420
Okay, give me the flashlight.

1198
01:20:52,235 --> 01:20:54,015
Police.

1199
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:55,855
Murder.

1200
01:20:55,955 --> 01:20:57,615
Christopher.

1201
01:20:57,715 --> 01:21:00,435
Christopher, turn on the lights.

1202
01:21:26,155 --> 01:21:28,155
Johnny.

1203
01:21:28,595 --> 01:21:30,595
Oh, Johnny.
- Lazy Legs.

1204
01:21:30,635 --> 01:21:32,635
Jeepers, I love you.

1205
01:21:37,355 --> 01:21:39,355
What's that?

1206
01:21:47,915 --> 01:21:49,915
Chris?

1207
01:21:57,755 --> 01:22:00,985
Johnny, is it Chris?
- Call him, quick.

1208
01:22:01,915 --> 01:22:03,775
Chris.

1209
01:22:03,875 --> 01:22:05,055
Chris.

1210
01:22:05,155 --> 01:22:06,615
I ought to push you over on your head.

1211
01:22:06,715 --> 01:22:09,815
How did I know he was coming here
tonight? I don't understand it.

1212
01:22:09,915 --> 01:22:12,175
You don't understand anything.
- But why get sore at me?

1213
01:22:12,275 --> 01:22:14,975
Well what are the use of my brains if
I'm tied up with a dumb cluck like you?

1214
01:22:15,075 --> 01:22:17,535
I told you to watch your step,
didn't I? - Right, blame it on me.

1215
01:22:17,635 --> 01:22:19,935
Oh why did you keep me here tonight?
I didn't want to stay.

1216
01:22:20,035 --> 01:22:22,255
Johnny. Don't talk like that.

1217
01:22:22,355 --> 01:22:24,295
Well it's the truth,
I'm fed up with you.

1218
01:22:24,395 --> 01:22:25,455
Johnny.

1219
01:22:25,555 --> 01:22:30,910
That's the only thing you ever
understood, I'm through with you.

1220
01:22:41,735 --> 01:22:44,115
<i>Jeepers, I love you, Johnny.</i>

1221
01:22:51,895 --> 01:22:54,275
<i>Jeepers, I love you, Johnny.</i>

1222
01:22:57,215 --> 01:23:00,275
Oh Lord, have mercy upon us sinners.

1223
01:23:00,455 --> 01:23:03,395
The way of the sinner
is made plain with stones.

1224
01:23:03,495 --> 01:23:07,065
But at the end thereof is the pit of Hell.

1225
01:23:07,415 --> 01:23:11,044
Oh Lord, be merciful to me, a sinner.

1226
01:23:11,455 --> 01:23:14,515
Hallelujah. Amen.
- Hallelujah. Amen.

1227
01:23:18,255 --> 01:23:21,315
Millie? Yeah, Kitty.
You seen Johnny?

1228
01:23:22,175 --> 01:23:25,875
Oh, I thought he'd go to Tiny's.
Was he getting tight?

1229
01:23:25,975 --> 01:23:27,475
Oh, just a fight.

1230
01:23:27,575 --> 01:23:29,115
Listen, he can't live without me...

1231
01:23:29,215 --> 01:23:31,315
...any more than I can live without him.

1232
01:23:31,415 --> 01:23:34,555
Said he was coming back here?
To beat me up?

1233
01:23:34,655 --> 01:23:38,565
Jeepers, the way that guy
shoots off his mouth.

1234
01:23:38,615 --> 01:23:41,635
Oh you don't have to warn me,
that's just the way he talks.

1235
01:23:41,735 --> 01:23:45,050
If you were in love you'd understand...

1236
01:23:45,055 --> 01:23:48,285
Oh stop it.
Johnny wouldn't kill a fly.

1237
01:23:49,615 --> 01:23:51,615
That's love, Honey.

1238
01:23:53,255 --> 01:23:56,355
Here he is now.
And has he got a bun on...

1239
01:23:56,455 --> 01:23:57,875
Goodbye, Hon.

1240
01:23:57,975 --> 01:23:59,975
Hello, Johnny.

1241
01:24:02,535 --> 01:24:05,000
Come on, Johnny, I heard you.

1242
01:24:17,055 --> 01:24:19,055
You lied to me, Kitty.

1243
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:21,275
It was him, wasn't it?

1244
01:24:21,375 --> 01:24:23,840
Can I help it if I'm in love?

1245
01:24:24,695 --> 01:24:27,160
No, it's just an infatuation.

1246
01:24:27,295 --> 01:24:30,780
You couldn't love a man like that, Kitty.

1247
01:24:31,055 --> 01:24:33,055
He's evil.

1248
01:24:33,175 --> 01:24:36,830
He wouldn't let you alone,
isn't that right?

1249
01:24:37,855 --> 01:24:39,855
I wanted to kill him.

1250
01:24:40,015 --> 01:24:41,515
But it's wrong.

1251
01:24:41,615 --> 01:24:43,615
Why did you come here?

1252
01:24:45,175 --> 01:24:47,235
To ask you to marry me.
- And what about your wife?

1253
01:24:47,335 --> 01:24:49,275
I haven't any wife, that's finished.
- For cat's sake, you didn't...

1254
01:24:49,375 --> 01:24:52,095
Her husband turned up, I'm free.

1255
01:24:54,655 --> 01:24:57,328
Oh now... don't cry, Kitty.

1256
01:24:57,695 --> 01:25:01,435
I know how you feel,
but that's all over now.

1257
01:25:01,495 --> 01:25:05,875
We all make mistakes.
I don't care what's happened, I...

1258
01:25:05,975 --> 01:25:07,755
I can marry you now, I...

1259
01:25:07,855 --> 01:25:09,475
I want you to be my wife.

1260
01:25:09,575 --> 01:25:12,595
We'll go away together,
away far off, so...

1261
01:25:12,695 --> 01:25:15,245
You can forget this other man.

1262
01:25:15,575 --> 01:25:18,465
Don't cry, Kitty.
Please don't cry.

1263
01:25:19,255 --> 01:25:22,075
I'm not crying you fool, I'm laughing.

1264
01:25:22,175 --> 01:25:24,175
Kitty...

1265
01:25:24,335 --> 01:25:27,515
Oh you idiot, how can a man be so dumb?

1266
01:25:27,615 --> 01:25:29,615
Kitty...

1267
01:25:33,335 --> 01:25:35,700
I've wanted to laugh in your face
ever since I first met you.

1268
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,300
You're old and ugly...

1269
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:40,435
...and I'm sick of you.
Sick. Sick. Sick.

1270
01:25:40,535 --> 01:25:41,600
Kitty, for Heaven sake.

1271
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:44,709
You kill Johnny?
I'd like to see you try.

1272
01:25:44,809 --> 01:25:47,800
Why, he'd break every bone in your body.
He's a man.

1273
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:49,515
You wanna marry me, you?.

1274
01:25:49,615 --> 01:25:51,740
Get out of here. Get out.

1275
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:54,115
Get away from me. Chris. Chris.

1276
01:25:54,215 --> 01:25:55,555
Get away from me. Chris.

1277
01:25:55,655 --> 01:25:57,655
Chris.

1278
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:12,484
Hey.

1279
01:26:12,775 --> 01:26:16,940
You better look out, Johnny.
You'll kill somebody.

1280
01:27:56,655 --> 01:27:58,655
Chris.

1281
01:28:23,655 --> 01:28:26,205
Hold on, Chris, wait a minute.

1282
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,495
What made you do it, Chris?

1283
01:28:30,575 --> 01:28:32,875
When these officers called me,
I wouldn't believe it.

1284
01:28:32,975 --> 01:28:35,795
We were tipped off on the telephone.
- By a man named Higgins.

1285
01:28:35,895 --> 01:28:38,955
I checked the cash before you came in.

1286
01:28:39,055 --> 01:28:41,520
You know how much is missing?

1287
01:28:42,095 --> 01:28:44,875
Over 1200 dollars.
- We'll take him along.

1288
01:28:44,975 --> 01:28:46,155
You can make the complaint, Mr. Hogarth.

1289
01:28:46,255 --> 01:28:48,255
Hold on, Morris.

1290
01:28:48,935 --> 01:28:50,915
I just can't do it.
- But Mr. Hogarth...

1291
01:28:51,015 --> 01:28:54,395
I know you've done your duty
and I'm obliged to you.

1292
01:28:54,495 --> 01:28:57,075
There's a box of cigars on the table,
take them along with you.

1293
01:28:57,175 --> 01:29:00,065
Okay, Mr. Hogarth, it's up to you.

1294
01:29:08,255 --> 01:29:11,060
Chris, it was a woman, wasn't it?

1295
01:29:11,975 --> 01:29:13,975
I thought so.

1296
01:29:14,735 --> 01:29:16,955
I'm not going to put you in jail, Chris...

1297
01:29:17,055 --> 01:29:19,860
...only of course you're through.

1298
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:42,700
Well I didn't do anything.
I want a law...

1299
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,800
I want a lawyer.

1300
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:48,350
Where was he picked up?
- Riverside Drive.

1301
01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:49,900
He tried to get away in the
murdered girl's car.

1302
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
That was my car.

1303
01:29:54,575 --> 01:29:56,435
This is yours, too.

1304
01:29:56,535 --> 01:30:00,615
It's got your initials on it,
but it's her blood.

1305
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:03,715
Here's 140 dollars that was taken
out of her pocketbook.

1306
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:05,815
That was mine.

1307
01:30:06,775 --> 01:30:10,600
It's her diamond ring, worth
5 or 600 dollars.

1308
01:30:12,735 --> 01:30:14,995
You guys know a lot, don't you?

1309
01:30:15,095 --> 01:30:17,095
It cost 1200.

1310
01:30:17,975 --> 01:30:20,270
These are personal jewelry.

1311
01:30:21,015 --> 01:30:23,795
Not much value, but he cleaned her out.

1312
01:30:23,895 --> 01:30:29,335
But why wouldn't I? She didn't
have any more use for it, did she?

1313
01:30:32,335 --> 01:30:33,395
Listen you guys, I want a lawyer.

1314
01:30:33,495 --> 01:30:36,130
I'm a citizen, I got my rights.

1315
01:30:38,055 --> 01:30:40,075
This belongs to you too, huh?

1316
01:30:40,175 --> 01:30:42,155
It's got your fingerprints on it.

1317
01:30:42,255 --> 01:30:43,955
Well naturally, I picked it up.

1318
01:30:44,055 --> 01:30:45,435
How did I know she was dead?

1319
01:30:45,535 --> 01:30:48,510
I thought she was asleep, at first.

1320
01:30:50,975 --> 01:30:53,235
She didn't paint those pictures.

1321
01:30:53,335 --> 01:30:57,200
Old Cross isn't as dumb as he looks.
He painted them.

1322
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:59,475
The accused brought me two pictures.

1323
01:30:59,575 --> 01:31:02,400
He told me Miss March painted them.

1324
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:05,800
In my expert opinion, there's
no doubt about it...

1325
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:07,955
She was a very great artist.

1326
01:31:08,055 --> 01:31:09,200
She told me she was an artist...

1327
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:12,110
...when she rented the studio,
he was with her.

1328
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:14,600
I didn't like him then
and I don't like him now.

1329
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:16,875
Yeah, he was mean when he was drunk.

1330
01:31:16,975 --> 01:31:20,300
He said he was gonna fix her when
he left my place around 2 a. m.

1331
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,595
That's when I tell him:

1332
01:31:21,695 --> 01:31:23,795
'You look out, Johnny,
you're gonna kill somebody.'

1333
01:31:23,895 --> 01:31:25,795
So he kills her with my icepick.

1334
01:31:25,895 --> 01:31:28,600
And then I heard her say
'Hello, Johnny', before she hung up.

1335
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:30,740
He was there, all right.

1336
01:31:30,775 --> 01:31:33,100
But what I don't understand is this
talk about her being an artist.

1337
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:34,700
I never saw her paint.

1338
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,700
That was one of her peculiar traits:

1339
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:39,075
She never let anyone see her paint.

1340
01:31:39,175 --> 01:31:41,435
I've compared her handwriting
with her signature.

1341
01:31:41,535 --> 01:31:43,075
There's no question.

1342
01:31:43,175 --> 01:31:45,405
Mr. Cross paint?

1343
01:31:45,935 --> 01:31:48,595
He only copied her work. He's a thief.

1344
01:31:48,695 --> 01:31:52,675
He stole from me, from his employer,
from Katherine March.

1345
01:31:52,775 --> 01:31:56,345
My wife, I mean my former wife,
is correct.

1346
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:59,500
I really can't paint.

1347
01:32:00,575 --> 01:32:03,275
My copies were so bad I
had to destroy them.

1348
01:32:03,375 --> 01:32:05,670
For cat's sake. He's lying.

1349
01:32:17,015 --> 01:32:19,245
Hello, Mr. Cross.
- Hello.

1350
01:32:19,855 --> 01:32:22,150
Tom Crocker, Evening Globe.

1351
01:32:22,335 --> 01:32:24,075
Oh yes, Tom Crocker.

1352
01:32:24,175 --> 01:32:26,555
Joe Williams, Morning World...
Conway's with the Ledger.

1353
01:32:26,655 --> 01:32:28,655
Hello.

1354
01:32:28,855 --> 01:32:30,855
Cigarette?
- No thanks.

1355
01:32:31,015 --> 01:32:32,395
Going to Sing Sing?

1356
01:32:32,495 --> 01:32:34,795
Yeah. I don't like to cover executions...

1357
01:32:34,895 --> 01:32:36,875
...but I must say this is one I don't mind.

1358
01:32:36,975 --> 01:32:38,435
You sure cooked County's goose,
Mr. Cross...

1359
01:32:38,535 --> 01:32:40,955
...when you testified you couldn't paint.

1360
01:32:41,055 --> 01:32:42,595
Nobody cooked County's goose
except Johnny...

1361
01:32:42,695 --> 01:32:44,755
...the way he shot off his mouth.

1362
01:32:44,855 --> 01:32:48,035
He was a dead pigeon when he dragged
the girl's name through the mud.

1363
01:32:48,135 --> 01:32:49,595
I watched the jury.

1364
01:32:49,695 --> 01:32:52,635
If he'd kept his trap shut, he might
have got off with his life.

1365
01:32:52,735 --> 01:32:54,235
Sure, the evidence was only circumstantial.

1366
01:32:54,335 --> 01:32:57,195
What do you mean?
He got a fair trial, didn't he?

1367
01:32:57,295 --> 01:32:59,315
Yeah, but there's always a doubt.

1368
01:32:59,415 --> 01:33:02,275
I suppose you fellas are going to say
it was a miscarriage of justice.

1369
01:33:02,375 --> 01:33:04,795
That someone is getting
away with murder?

1370
01:33:04,895 --> 01:33:06,915
Not me, there's no such thing.

1371
01:33:07,015 --> 01:33:09,955
Mr. Cross, nobody gets away with murder.

1372
01:33:10,055 --> 01:33:12,875
How's that?
- Oh, don't get him started.

1373
01:33:12,975 --> 01:33:16,885
He'll talk your ear off,
that's his pet theory.

1374
01:33:17,135 --> 01:33:19,075
All right, go ahead and laugh all you like.

1375
01:33:19,175 --> 01:33:20,995
But no one escapes punishment.

1376
01:33:21,095 --> 01:33:24,035
I figure we have a little
courtroom right in here:

1377
01:33:24,135 --> 01:33:26,515
Judge, jury and executioner.

1378
01:33:27,815 --> 01:33:29,195
I don't get it.

1379
01:33:29,295 --> 01:33:31,835
Murder never solves anything,
how about it, fellas?

1380
01:33:31,935 --> 01:33:32,995
You've covered lots of trials.

1381
01:33:33,095 --> 01:33:35,275
I'm sorry, but I have to admit you're right.

1382
01:33:35,375 --> 01:33:38,235
The problem just moves in here
where it can never get out.

1383
01:33:38,335 --> 01:33:41,055
Right here in solitary. So what?

1384
01:33:41,055 --> 01:33:43,075
So you go right on punishing yourself.

1385
01:33:43,175 --> 01:33:46,065
You can't get away with it. Never.

1386
01:33:46,255 --> 01:33:48,075
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

1387
01:33:48,175 --> 01:33:50,955
Well you haven't seen as much of
murder as I have, Mr. Cross.

1388
01:33:51,055 --> 01:33:57,175
I'd rather have the judge give me the
works than have to do it to myself.

1389
01:33:59,855 --> 01:34:02,830
What time do they throw the switch?

1390
01:34:04,335 --> 01:34:06,335
11 o'clock.

1391
01:34:40,495 --> 01:34:43,115
I didn't do it,
I tell you I didn't do it.

1392
01:34:43,215 --> 01:34:44,915
Won't anyone believe me?

1393
01:34:45,015 --> 01:34:47,155
Give me a break, somebody.
I never got a square deal in my life.

1394
01:34:47,255 --> 01:34:50,825
Won't somebody,
somebody give me a break...

1395
01:35:53,135 --> 01:35:54,515
Johnny.

1396
01:35:54,615 --> 01:35:56,615
Johnny.

1397
01:35:57,175 --> 01:35:59,175
Oh, Johnny. Johnny.

1398
01:36:01,735 --> 01:36:04,329
<i>Lazy Legs, Lazy Legs...</i>

1399
01:36:04,495 --> 01:36:06,915
<i>Johnny darling... Johnny darling...</i>

1400
01:36:07,015 --> 01:36:10,925
<i>I'm here, baby...
Jeepers I love you, Johnny...</i>

1401
01:36:12,535 --> 01:36:14,535
<i>Johnny.</i>

1402
01:36:16,335 --> 01:36:19,168
<i>Lazy Legs, Lazy Legs...</i>

1403
01:36:19,255 --> 01:36:22,167
<i>Jeepers I love you, Johnny...</i>

1404
01:36:45,055 --> 01:36:48,445
<i>Oh Johnny, now we're together...</i>

1405
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,235
<i>Yeah... He killed me too, Kitty...</i>

1406
01:36:53,335 --> 01:36:55,995
<i>He brought us together, Johnny...</i>

1407
01:36:56,095 --> 01:36:58,095
<i>Forever...</i>

1408
01:36:58,575 --> 01:36:59,835
Kitty...

1409
01:36:59,935 --> 01:37:02,955
<i>Oh you idiot, how can a man be so dumb?</i>

1410
01:37:03,055 --> 01:37:04,795
No, Kitty, no.

1411
01:37:04,895 --> 01:37:07,115
<i>You wanted to marry me? You?</i>

1412
01:37:07,215 --> 01:37:10,190
<i>She's mine, Chris, mine... forever.</i>

1413
01:37:10,255 --> 01:37:12,255
Leave me alone.

1414
01:37:12,935 --> 01:37:16,355
<i>You killed me, Chris, you're old
and ugly and you killed me...</i>

1415
01:37:16,455 --> 01:37:19,395
<i>You killed me, you killed me,
you killed me.</i>

1416
01:37:19,495 --> 01:37:21,495
No, Kitty, it's him.

1417
01:37:21,735 --> 01:37:25,195
You were innocent, you were pure, that's
what he killed in you. He's the murderer

1418
01:37:25,295 --> 01:37:27,275
<i>No, he's not. Not Johnny.</i>

1419
01:37:27,375 --> 01:37:30,173
<i>You see, Chris? She loves me...</i>

1420
01:37:30,455 --> 01:37:34,705
That's why you had to die.
You're the one I killed.

1421
01:37:34,935 --> 01:37:36,935
<i>She's mine, Chris.</i>

1422
01:37:37,895 --> 01:37:39,895
<i>You kill Johnny?</i>

1423
01:37:39,935 --> 01:37:41,875
<i>I'd like to see you try.
- Kitty...</i>

1424
01:37:41,975 --> 01:37:44,195
<i>He'd break every bone in your body.
- Kitty.</i>

1425
01:37:44,295 --> 01:37:46,295
<i>He's a man.
- Kitty.</i>

1426
01:37:59,055 --> 01:38:01,410
<i>Johnny... Johnny...</i>

1427
01:38:02,695 --> 01:38:05,163
<i>Oh, Johnny.... Johnny.</i>

1428
01:38:08,855 --> 01:38:11,235
<i>Jeepers, I love you, Johnny.</i>

1429
01:38:17,655 --> 01:38:20,460
There's something wrong in there.

1430
01:38:44,695 --> 01:38:48,095
It's all right old man,
it's all right...

1431
01:38:48,095 --> 01:38:50,095
<i>Johnny.</i>

1432
01:38:50,135 --> 01:38:52,135
<i>Oh Johnny.</i>

1433
01:38:52,375 --> 01:38:54,755
<i>Jeepers, I love you, Johnny.</i>

1434
01:39:17,215 --> 01:39:19,935
Get up, come on, get up, get up.

1435
01:39:21,535 --> 01:39:23,535
Oh, it's you.

1436
01:39:23,535 --> 01:39:25,355
Haven't I told you to keep out of this park?

1437
01:39:25,455 --> 01:39:27,835
You know the Mayor's orders.

1438
01:39:36,095 --> 01:39:39,750
Get on down to the Bowery,
where you belong.

1439
01:39:40,135 --> 01:39:42,135
Come on, come on.

1440
01:39:52,975 --> 01:39:54,675
Who's that rick?

1441
01:39:54,775 --> 01:39:56,475
He has a crazy idea he killed
a couple of people...

1442
01:39:56,575 --> 01:39:59,275
...five or six years ago.
Can't get it off his mind.

1443
01:39:59,375 --> 01:40:02,180
Always trying to give himself up.

1444
01:40:03,375 --> 01:40:07,880
Wants to be tried and executed...
you know these nuts.

1445
01:40:52,455 --> 01:40:55,260
Well, there goes her masterpiece.

1446
01:41:00,975 --> 01:41:02,835
I really hate to part with it.

1447
01:41:02,935 --> 01:41:08,205
For 10,000 dollars I shouldn't
think you'd mind, Mr. Dellarowe.

1448
01:41:22,175 --> 01:41:24,175
<i>Johnny.</i>

1449
01:41:26,095 --> 01:41:28,095
<i>Oh Johnny.</i>

1450
01:41:30,015 --> 01:41:32,085
<i>Lazy Legs.</i>

1451
01:41:35,095 --> 01:41:37,475
<i>Jeepers, I love you, Johnny.</i>
