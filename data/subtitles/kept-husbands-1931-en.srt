2
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:18,000
I've never seen anything like it.
Talk about your heroism?

3
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:21,680
He went down in that blazing pit
not once, mind you, but three times...

4
00:01:21,699 --> 00:01:23,601
...and carried them all out,
one after another.

5
00:01:23,622 --> 00:01:26,602
- Not really.
- Why, he doesn't know what fear is.

6
00:01:26,623 --> 00:01:28,703
Probably too dumb to know what it is.

7
00:01:28,704 --> 00:01:32,304
Well, where there's no sense,
there's no feeling.

8
00:01:32,335 --> 00:01:35,200
There's nothing dumb about him.
I wish I had more men like him.

9
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:36,901
I hope you rewarded him, Arthur.

10
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:38,230
Say, you wouldn't believe this.

11
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:41,780
I presented him with a check for a thousand
dollars and he wouldn't take it.

12
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:42,799
What?

13
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,300
Must be interesting to meet
a man like that.

14
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:47,301
You're going to.
I've asked him over.

15
00:01:47,322 --> 00:01:48,900
- Here?
- Yes, tonight.

16
00:01:48,921 --> 00:01:49,921
For heaven's sake.

17
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:52,300
But we're going to the opera
right after dinner.

18
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,600
That's alright, he's only coming
for dinner.

19
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:57,500
- A workman?
- For dinner?

20
00:01:57,521 --> 00:01:58,700
Yes. Why not?

21
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,800
Arthur, what ghastly joke is this?

22
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:03,400
But Henrietta, he's a hero.

23
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:05,800
- In overalls.
- What will our guests say?

24
00:02:05,831 --> 00:02:08,200
Call him up at once and tell him
he's not to come over.

25
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:11,401
He isn't a common worker.
He's a steel boss.

26
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,902
See, Mother, it's perfectly alright.

27
00:02:13,923 --> 00:02:16,600
- He's a steel boss.
- His name is Dick Brunton.

28
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:18,480
I don't care what his name is.

29
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:21,250
Brunton? Brunton?
That name sounds familiar.

30
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:23,950
He's a fine chap. I've had my eye
on him for a long while.

31
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:27,101
Don't talk to me.
Overalls!

32
00:02:27,802 --> 00:02:31,902
Well, it'll be a thrill having
a working man for dinner.

33
00:02:32,303 --> 00:02:36,950
Yeah? Well, you've had one
for a good many years.

34
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:38,100
Me!

35
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:40,171
That's all I was when I started.

36
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:42,560
But this invitation, it's downright cruelty.

37
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:45,440
Dinner with all our flunkies around
might prove very embarrassing...

38
00:02:45,461 --> 00:02:47,900
...to Slim Jim, the railbender.

39
00:02:47,931 --> 00:02:50,200
Gosh, I never thought of that.

40
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:54,200
It'll be lots of fun watching him scoop
mashed potatoes on his knife.

41
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:56,201
Oh, it won't be as bad as that.

42
00:02:56,602 --> 00:02:58,980
I know those strong silent men.

43
00:02:59,021 --> 00:03:02,581
Well, I'll put the radio on while
he's inhaling his soup.

44
00:03:13,682 --> 00:03:16,182
Longview 5855.

45
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,680
Now what are you going to do?

46
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:19,601
Break the big news to Charlie Bates.

47
00:03:20,002 --> 00:03:22,000
Well, I guess I'll go up and change
for dinner.

48
00:03:22,021 --> 00:03:23,301
Yes, by all means.

49
00:03:23,332 --> 00:03:26,400
And Finnie's laid a nice new pair
of overalls for you.

50
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:28,321
Oh, hello, Charlie.

51
00:03:28,322 --> 00:03:30,622
Listen, you're going to have
the laugh of your life tonight.

52
00:03:30,623 --> 00:03:34,023
Father's invited a big he-man from
the mill for dinner.

53
00:03:34,054 --> 00:03:37,524
Alright, Dot, I'll come over
and bring my dinner pail.

54
00:03:37,545 --> 00:03:39,885
Now don't fail to get over here
on time, will you, Charlie?

55
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,380
You bet, Dot. As soon as the
whistle blows...

56
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:43,900
...I'll throw down my tools and rush
right over.

57
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:46,900
Alright, Charlie, goodbye.

58
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:50,031
What's the opera tonight?

59
00:03:50,032 --> 00:03:52,200
Well, I think they're singing
Il Trovatore.

60
00:03:52,201 --> 00:03:54,701
- Il Trovatore, good.
- I'm glad I ducked it.

61
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:58,202
I hear enough anvil chorusus
out at the foundry.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,403
Dot, I know you'll enjoy
the opera tonight.

63
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:06,704
- Why, she's not going.
- Pass the olives.

64
00:04:10,005 --> 00:04:13,000
Dorothy, would you mind passing
the olives?

65
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:17,600
Do the doctors think they
can cure it?

66
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:19,380
- Cure what?
- Your hearing.

67
00:04:19,381 --> 00:04:22,481
I've asked you eighteen times
to pass the olives.

68
00:04:22,882 --> 00:04:24,482
Pardon me.

69
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:29,583
I said the olives.

70
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:32,684
Excuse me.

71
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:47,185
Say, Dot.
Get a load of that.

72
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,586
The big barrel looking for
a toothpick.

73
00:04:54,387 --> 00:04:57,487
What a nice charm.
May I see it, please?

74
00:04:58,688 --> 00:05:01,188
- Oh, it's nothing really.
- Oh, pulease!

75
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:04,789
Thank you.

76
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,890
Ladies and gentlemen.

77
00:05:12,691 --> 00:05:15,201
A grievous social error has been
made here tonight.

78
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:16,292
Dorothy!

79
00:05:16,323 --> 00:05:19,393
A guest has been brought here
under false pretenses.

80
00:05:19,414 --> 00:05:22,294
Let me introduce to you
the real Dick Brunton.

81
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:25,305
All-American halfback.
The man who beat Yale.

82
00:05:25,336 --> 00:05:28,800
Why, Brunton!
Say, I had no idea!

83
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:32,901
Halfback? I thought you said
he was a steel boss.

84
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:37,300
Boy, I'll never forget that forward
pass as long as I live.

85
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:39,700
Well, I'll be a something or other.

86
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:42,901
You certainly will.
Well, I'm glad that's out.

87
00:05:42,932 --> 00:05:44,902
You've had me guessing all night.

88
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:46,903
Serve coffee in the drawing room.

89
00:05:46,904 --> 00:05:49,404
Dick Brunton, this is a surprise.

90
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:59,000
- One or two lumps, Mrs. Parker?
- One, please.

91
00:06:00,601 --> 00:06:03,521
Well, Brunton, have you changed
your mind about that check?

92
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:05,622
No, sir. Thanks just the same.

93
00:06:05,643 --> 00:06:08,900
- Have you talked it over with your mother?
- Yes, sir, and she agrees with me.

94
00:06:08,921 --> 00:06:11,001
You see, Mr. Parker, I didn't do
that for money.

95
00:06:11,002 --> 00:06:14,302
I did it because... well, anybody'd do it.
You understand, don't you?

96
00:06:14,323 --> 00:06:15,780
Yes, I think I do.

97
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:18,280
A thousand dollars is a lot
of money, Mr. Brunton.

98
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:20,900
- Yes, but...
- Oh, don't be silly. Go ahead and take it.

99
00:06:21,301 --> 00:06:23,301
Why? Do you want me to?

100
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:26,000
Would you, if I wanted you to?

101
00:06:26,021 --> 00:06:27,301
- No.
- Uh-oh.

102
00:06:27,322 --> 00:06:29,532
Fourth down, nine yards to go.

103
00:06:30,553 --> 00:06:33,743
Well, at the very least, I'll see
that you get the Carnegie medal.

104
00:06:33,764 --> 00:06:35,664
Oh, no, please don't do anything
like that.

105
00:06:36,565 --> 00:06:38,465
How does it feel to be a hero?

106
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:40,066
You'll never know.

107
00:06:40,097 --> 00:06:42,000
Dorothea!

108
00:06:42,031 --> 00:06:45,301
Now please leave Mr. Brunton alone.
I want to talk to him.

109
00:06:47,902 --> 00:06:51,262
Why didn't you tell us you were Dick
Brunton, the all-American halfback?

110
00:06:51,283 --> 00:06:54,300
Why should I? Right now I'm simply
your father's steel boss.

111
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:56,801
Well, I can't understand why
you kept it out.

112
00:06:56,832 --> 00:06:59,662
The all-American, I mean.
Makes things easier for you.

113
00:06:59,683 --> 00:07:02,063
I know. But easy things aren't
much good.

114
00:07:02,084 --> 00:07:05,100
But aside from that, it would get you
in with the right crowd.

115
00:07:05,131 --> 00:07:08,801
You can't run around with the right
crowd on forty-five a week

116
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:11,701
Mr. and Mrs. Post.

117
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,100
Good evening, everybody!

118
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:15,801
- Hello, there.
- Hello.

119
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:18,802
- Hello, Henrietta.
- How are you?

120
00:07:18,843 --> 00:07:21,403
Say good evening everybody,
Pansy, darling.

121
00:07:22,104 --> 00:07:23,700
Are you ready to go, Henrietta?

122
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:26,005
- Yes, dear. Good evening, Llewellyn.
- How do you do?

123
00:07:26,026 --> 00:07:28,280
Shall we go upstairs while
we get our wraps?

124
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:29,299
Naturally!

125
00:07:29,527 --> 00:07:34,127
- Say, Llewellyn, will you have a...
- Oh, you'd better go sit in the car.

126
00:07:34,128 --> 00:07:36,400
- Yes, dear.
- And bundle Pansy up good.

127
00:07:36,431 --> 00:07:39,800
Because I don't want my little bitsy
baby to catch cold.

128
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:41,801
Yes, dear.

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,500
Yes dear, yes dear, yes dear,
what a spectacle!

130
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:56,401
Why, he's no more than a
kept husband.

131
00:07:56,402 --> 00:07:59,902
It's a tragedy. Llewellyn Post should have
been the greatest architect in America.

132
00:07:59,903 --> 00:08:02,270
But he married Lucille.
She wouldn't let him work.

133
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:05,571
She killed all his ambition.
It's her fault, not his.

134
00:08:05,872 --> 00:08:08,350
Oh, you don't have to go yet.
Dad and I aren't going out.

135
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:11,020
I know, but it's late for me.
I have to get home and go to bed.

136
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,700
You see, I have to be at the
plant at six.

137
00:08:12,721 --> 00:08:15,701
Six, eh? I never go to bed until six.

138
00:08:15,852 --> 00:08:17,900
I'll have Hopkins take you home
in the car.

139
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:20,900
I haven't seen a first act in years.

140
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:22,601
- Well, all set?
- Yep.

141
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,100
- Good night, Mr. Brunton.
- Good night, Mrs. Parker.

142
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:26,401
I've had a wonderful time.

143
00:08:26,492 --> 00:08:28,802
- Have a good time.
- We will.

144
00:08:31,403 --> 00:08:33,260
You've been mighty kind,
Miss Parker.

145
00:08:33,281 --> 00:08:35,261
I'll remember this evening for
a long time.

146
00:08:35,362 --> 00:08:36,600
So will I.

147
00:08:36,731 --> 00:08:40,201
I hope you'll forgive me for
exposing your, er... past.

148
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,102
- That's all right.
- I wish you'd think it over.

149
00:08:43,143 --> 00:08:45,603
You know, about getting in
with the right crowd.

150
00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:48,650
- Honestly, I can't afford to.
- That wouldn't make any difference.

151
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:50,951
Anyhow, I spend my spare
time studying.

152
00:08:50,972 --> 00:08:52,600
See, I want to get somewhere.

153
00:08:52,621 --> 00:08:54,701
There's more to life than just
gold footballs.

154
00:08:54,722 --> 00:08:58,952
Really? And there's more to life than
grinding away at books every night.

155
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:00,980
I don't like to. I'm human.

156
00:09:00,981 --> 00:09:03,781
You don't mean it. I wouldn't have
suspected that.

157
00:09:03,782 --> 00:09:06,282
I enjoy a good time as much
as anyone.

158
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:08,663
But I'm working now so I can have
fun when I get older.

159
00:09:08,684 --> 00:09:11,184
- And can't enjoy it.
- Well, maybe you're right.

160
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:14,085
- Well, Brunton, if you're ready, we'll...
- Yes, sir.

161
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:16,200
- Good night, Miss Parker, thank you.
- Good night.

162
00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:19,400
Thank you too, you've been
very kind.

163
00:09:19,421 --> 00:09:20,701
Not at all.

164
00:09:23,302 --> 00:09:25,000
Well, good night, Mr. Parker.

165
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,501
Good night, my boy.

166
00:09:38,502 --> 00:09:39,202
Well?

167
00:09:39,503 --> 00:09:40,503
Well?

168
00:09:40,534 --> 00:09:42,704
Did you notice how he balanced
those peas on his knife?

169
00:09:42,725 --> 00:09:45,680
Oh, don't rub it in.
How about your thousand dollar check?

170
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:48,480
Oh, that boy has something.
He's one man in a thousand.

171
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:50,581
Thousand? He's one in a million.

172
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:54,000
And as far as your daughter's concerned,
he's the one man in the world.

173
00:09:54,021 --> 00:09:57,100
- What do you mean?
- I mean I'm going to marry him.

174
00:09:57,121 --> 00:10:00,001
- What? Are you crazy?
- You just bet I am.

175
00:10:00,022 --> 00:10:02,242
Look here, Dot, you're not serious.

176
00:10:02,263 --> 00:10:05,243
Dad, I was never more serious
in my life.

177
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:06,600
The minute I saw him...

178
00:10:06,621 --> 00:10:10,130
I didn't give two hoots if he gargled
his soup in the key of A minor.

179
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,000
All I knew was that boy was
made for me.

180
00:10:13,021 --> 00:10:15,501
And what's more, I'm gonna have him.

181
00:10:15,502 --> 00:10:19,002
Now look here, Dot, aren't you
just a little bit hasty?

182
00:10:19,023 --> 00:10:21,150
I can't get him too quick
to suit me.

183
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:24,400
See here, Dot, and listen.

184
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:26,231
Don't you fool yourself.

185
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:28,480
Now, I'm a pretty good judge
of men. I tell you...

186
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:32,381
...this boy has real character and he'll
never propose to you.

187
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,282
Now see here, Dad, listen.

188
00:10:34,453 --> 00:10:37,500
There isn't a man in this world
a woman can't win,

189
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:38,900
if she really wants to land him.

190
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:41,500
- I don't believe that.
- All right.

191
00:10:41,531 --> 00:10:44,641
- All I ask is four weeks.
- Four weeks.

192
00:10:44,662 --> 00:10:46,262
Four weeks.

193
00:10:47,863 --> 00:10:51,563
When do you think your wayward
son will stagger in?

194
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:52,964
Can't tell you.

195
00:10:53,165 --> 00:10:54,765
Well, it's getting late.

196
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:58,366
Oh, rich folks like the Parkers
have supper till all hours.

197
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:02,867
Yeah, what's caviar to the few
is apple sauce to the gander.

198
00:11:03,388 --> 00:11:06,068
You should have told him to take
that thousand bucks.

199
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:08,800
Oh, no, Hughie, why should I?

200
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,901
Why, I wouldn't want Dick to take
anything he didn't earn.

201
00:11:13,302 --> 00:11:15,602
A penny saved is a dollar earned.

202
00:11:16,303 --> 00:11:20,450
If you had all that sugar, maybe
you could ease up on my board bill.

203
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:23,501
I'm in no hurry for
the money, Hughie.

204
00:11:23,592 --> 00:11:27,200
Well, that's just as well,
cause I ain't got any.

205
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,401
Say, would you mind honking the horn
a couple of times?

206
00:11:43,432 --> 00:11:44,502
Sure.

207
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,303
Well, Mother, I told you we'd be riding
around in a Rolls-Royce one day.

208
00:12:06,324 --> 00:12:08,704
- Did you have a nice time, Dick?
- I certainly did.

209
00:12:12,805 --> 00:12:16,000
Hey, highpockets, did you bring
home the bacon?

210
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:18,290
No, I told him he could keep
his check.

211
00:12:18,441 --> 00:12:20,891
I figured that all in.

212
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:24,092
- Did you give Miss Parker my love?
- Sure.

213
00:12:24,113 --> 00:12:26,900
- What'd she say?
- I'll take vanilla.

214
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:31,900
Well, now that that's all settled,
maybe you'd better hit the hay.

215
00:12:31,921 --> 00:12:37,000
I claim early to rise and early
to bed and you'll live all your life.

216
00:12:37,821 --> 00:12:39,601
Until you're dead.

217
00:12:41,202 --> 00:12:43,202
Tell me, Dick, what kind
of people are they?

218
00:12:43,403 --> 00:12:45,603
Oh, you'd get a great kick
out of them Mother.

219
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:48,504
The father's a pretty good scout.
Don't do that, Mother!

220
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:51,065
- You're going to ruin your teeth.
- Oh, they were ruined long a ago.

221
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:52,866
How about Mrs. Parker?

222
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:55,367
She's got one of those trick
English accents.

223
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:57,768
The only trouble is it slips out
of gear all the time...

224
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,999
...and she gets all balled up between
her ballses and her bases.

225
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,200
Well, that's no crime.
Is she nice?

226
00:13:03,221 --> 00:13:05,101
She almost froze me when I first
came in.

227
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:08,002
Looked at me as though she expected
I'd be wearing overalls.

228
00:13:08,003 --> 00:13:10,303
Oh, you only imagine that.

229
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:11,604
How about the daughter?

230
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,400
Not for mine.
Just plain spoiled.

231
00:13:14,451 --> 00:13:17,041
Oh, now, maybe that isn't her fault.

232
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,800
Too much money isn't good
for anybody.

233
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:23,801
Still, some of them make very
good wives.

234
00:13:23,822 --> 00:13:26,000
Well, I can never imagine her
as a wife.

235
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:30,100
Imagine Dot Parker bending
over a washtub.

236
00:13:30,121 --> 00:13:32,751
Maybe she wouldn't be afraid
to bend over one if she had too.

237
00:13:32,772 --> 00:13:33,772
Oh, don't be silly.

238
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:37,373
She's about as useful as a little
silky kitten.

239
00:13:37,674 --> 00:13:40,474
That's what they should have
called her, kitten.

240
00:13:41,775 --> 00:13:43,175
Kitten.

241
00:14:07,276 --> 00:14:09,276
- Hello, Mr. Barber.
- Hello, Dick.

242
00:14:09,297 --> 00:14:11,800
- Look all of these.
- What are they?

243
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:15,601
The Mississippi Bridge plans. Something
that will revolutionize the industry.

244
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:19,502
- That is, if we can sell the idea.
- You don't seem very confident.

245
00:14:19,503 --> 00:14:22,103
I know it's the greatest engineering
achievement in years.

246
00:14:23,204 --> 00:14:25,200
Parker's willing to bet his roll on it.

247
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:28,901
But it'll take a real salesman
to make others see it as we do.

248
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,902
- Well, let's get started.
- Alright.

249
00:14:30,923 --> 00:14:33,203
Can you get them finished
by one o'clock?

250
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:35,704
- Yes, sir.
- Fine, we're awfully busy.

251
00:14:35,855 --> 00:14:37,300
I know I can depend on you.

252
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:07,401
Hey, how long have you
been working here?

253
00:15:16,702 --> 00:15:18,400
Well, there she is again.

254
00:15:18,421 --> 00:15:21,201
Couldn't be more regular if she
punched the clock.

255
00:15:21,232 --> 00:15:23,052
Ain't that old man Parker's daughter?

256
00:15:23,073 --> 00:15:25,253
- Sure.
- What's she here for?

257
00:15:25,274 --> 00:15:28,700
Well, if you don't know, you're
the only one that don't.

258
00:15:28,701 --> 00:15:30,701
She's here to grab Dick Brunton.

259
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:32,402
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

260
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:36,503
Pretty soft for Brunton.
That girl's independently rich.

261
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:40,804
She's got nothing on him.
He's independently poor.

262
00:15:40,855 --> 00:15:45,105
Gee! I wish some doll with all her
dough was nuts about me.

263
00:15:53,206 --> 00:15:54,906
Sorry, busy.

264
00:16:07,907 --> 00:16:09,900
Why, Dick, too busy for me?

265
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:13,301
- Oh, Dot. How are you.
- Fine, how are you?

266
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:15,902
Well, I'm kind of tide up.
Mr. Barber gave me a rush job.

267
00:16:15,923 --> 00:16:17,880
- Oh, that can wait.
- No, it's very important.

268
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:20,100
But I've got something even
more important.

269
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:21,601
Honestly, Dot, I can't.

270
00:16:25,002 --> 00:16:27,552
- It's your lunch hour, isn't it?
- But I promised Mr. Barber.

271
00:16:27,573 --> 00:16:29,640
- Oh, he can spare you for an hour.
- No.

272
00:16:29,701 --> 00:16:31,650
- Hello, Mr. Barber.
- Hello, Miss Parker.

273
00:16:31,651 --> 00:16:33,551
Do you mind if I take Dick away
for an hour?

274
00:16:33,582 --> 00:16:35,752
Why, no, not at all.

275
00:16:35,773 --> 00:16:39,253
- Those plans can wait, can't they?
- Yes, certainly.

276
00:16:39,274 --> 00:16:42,654
- But Mr. Barber...
- That's alright, my boy, that's all right.

277
00:16:42,675 --> 00:16:44,655
Thank you, Mr. Barber.

278
00:17:19,556 --> 00:17:20,656
Oh.

279
00:17:20,857 --> 00:17:22,107
Oh, no.

280
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,108
Oh, but this is my treat.

281
00:17:24,139 --> 00:17:25,709
You can't sign here.

282
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,550
You're not a member.

283
00:17:30,151 --> 00:17:32,351
- That's yours, Paul.
- Thank you.

284
00:17:42,452 --> 00:17:44,452
They always work.

285
00:17:45,353 --> 00:17:48,653
Gee, that's a keen trick.
You gotta show me how to do that.

286
00:17:53,454 --> 00:17:56,454
Dick, know what day it is today?

287
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,555
Yeah, Wednesday... December 20th.

288
00:18:00,456 --> 00:18:03,256
It was exactly for weeks ago
today I met you.

289
00:18:03,297 --> 00:18:05,657
That's right, four weeks.

290
00:18:07,058 --> 00:18:08,800
What are you smiling at?

291
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,401
Just thought of something.

292
00:18:10,432 --> 00:18:12,802
Just think, four weeks.

293
00:18:12,803 --> 00:18:16,603
- And it seems as if I'd known you ages.
- That's just the way it seems to me too.

294
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,804
But I have known you a long time.

295
00:18:18,825 --> 00:18:20,705
I've seen many games you've played.

296
00:18:20,706 --> 00:18:22,130
Why, when you beat Yale,

297
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:25,550
I even cut your picture out of the paper
and put it over my dresser.

298
00:18:25,581 --> 00:18:27,500
Oh, you're kidding.

299
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:29,101
Am I?

300
00:18:31,202 --> 00:18:33,102
- There.
- Well...

301
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:37,573
Gee, that... that was published about
five years ago.

302
00:18:37,594 --> 00:18:39,999
I guess you believe me now.

303
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,900
December 20th.

304
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:44,600
Five more days till Christmas.

305
00:18:45,651 --> 00:18:47,201
I'd better get busy.

306
00:18:47,222 --> 00:18:49,632
I suppose you did your Christmas
shopping early.

307
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:52,633
I've only got one more thing to get.

308
00:18:53,254 --> 00:18:55,544
Been expecting to get it for
four weeks.

309
00:18:55,565 --> 00:18:57,485
You'd better not put it off
any longer.

310
00:18:57,499 --> 00:19:00,500
- That depends on you.
- On me?

311
00:19:00,521 --> 00:19:01,601
Hm-hmm.

312
00:19:01,602 --> 00:19:03,802
Well, if there's anything I can do.

313
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:08,403
What is it?

314
00:19:11,904 --> 00:19:13,500
A proposal.

315
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:15,701
- A what?
- May I have it?

316
00:19:16,202 --> 00:19:19,102
- You mean you want me...
- I want you.

317
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,703
You're only kidding.

318
00:19:22,734 --> 00:19:26,304
Alright, just propose to me and see
whether I am or not.

319
00:19:27,005 --> 00:19:29,100
Dot, I can't do anything like that.

320
00:19:29,131 --> 00:19:30,901
- You mean...
- I'm nothing but a...

321
00:19:32,002 --> 00:19:34,902
You mean you won't propose to me?

322
00:19:37,003 --> 00:19:41,103
- I'd propose if I could, but...
- Very well, I'll propose to you, Dick.

323
00:19:41,194 --> 00:19:42,904
Will you marry me?

324
00:19:44,005 --> 00:19:47,900
No, Dot, I can't. I haven't anything
to offer a girl like you.

325
00:19:47,901 --> 00:19:51,501
You're all I want.
I know what you're thinking.

326
00:19:51,532 --> 00:19:53,702
But don't let that stand
in your way.

327
00:19:53,903 --> 00:19:56,103
Don't you love me enough to forget it?

328
00:19:57,304 --> 00:19:59,604
Oh, I wish I could forget.

329
00:20:00,205 --> 00:20:03,605
Oh, if you really love me,
you'll try.

330
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:07,700
Won't you please try?
Come on, Dick, say yes.

331
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,801
No.

332
00:20:26,702 --> 00:20:29,100
Dick!
Do you mean that?

333
00:20:29,201 --> 00:20:30,401
Yes.

334
00:20:33,002 --> 00:20:34,702
Oh, gee, I'm so happy.

335
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:39,800
- Put that on.
- No, I can't do that.

336
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,001
Oh, but look, some day you'll
afford to buy me one.

337
00:20:42,602 --> 00:20:44,502
Go on, Dickie.

338
00:20:45,103 --> 00:20:46,903
Please.

339
00:21:04,004 --> 00:21:07,204
Mrs. Borham, crystal champagne set.

340
00:21:07,205 --> 00:21:09,405
Miss Prag, you're impossible.

341
00:21:09,446 --> 00:21:11,440
Send her a Christmas card.

342
00:21:11,441 --> 00:21:14,000
And her husband is a victim
of the stock market.

343
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:16,001
Spare me your sarcasm, Arthur.

344
00:21:16,002 --> 00:21:18,400
- That completes the list, doesn't it?
- Yes, ma'am.

345
00:21:18,421 --> 00:21:20,201
Mother, you've forgotten
all about aunt Julia.

346
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:23,402
Thanks for reminding me, Dorothea.

347
00:21:23,443 --> 00:21:26,700
Now, let's see, what is useful
in a boarding house?

348
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:28,001
A long reach.

349
00:21:29,002 --> 00:21:31,002
Money's useful in a boarding
house, Mother.

350
00:21:31,003 --> 00:21:34,103
If I send Julia money, she'll only
spend it.

351
00:21:34,104 --> 00:21:37,504
Send aunt Julia a nice warm shawl,
Miss Prag.

352
00:21:40,305 --> 00:21:42,400
- That will be all?
- Yes, Prag.

353
00:21:48,601 --> 00:21:51,401
Christmas gets more appalling
every year.

354
00:21:51,432 --> 00:21:55,602
Prag's so stupid, I'm sure she's
omitted someone.

355
00:21:55,803 --> 00:21:57,703
She has.

356
00:22:06,304 --> 00:22:09,300
Now, what do you want
for Christmas?

357
00:22:09,801 --> 00:22:12,999
- Oh, I've selected my Christmas present.
- Oh, you have, have you?

358
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,700
Well, what is it?

359
00:22:14,721 --> 00:22:16,601
Not what, who.

360
00:22:16,622 --> 00:22:20,120
Stop your foolishness, Dorothea.
What do you want for Christmas?

361
00:22:20,141 --> 00:22:21,500
A husband!

362
00:22:21,571 --> 00:22:24,171
I'm afraid I have no sense of humor.

363
00:22:24,192 --> 00:22:27,100
- Wait a minute, so it's happened, has it?
- Hm-hmm.

364
00:22:27,131 --> 00:22:30,200
- Give a woman for weeks.
- What are you talking about?

365
00:22:30,201 --> 00:22:33,101
Mother, I'm going to marry
Dick Brunton.

366
00:22:33,122 --> 00:22:36,702
- Dick Brunton? The working man?
- Yes.

367
00:22:36,733 --> 00:22:38,600
But he's a steel boss.

368
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,201
Ohhh!

369
00:22:41,602 --> 00:22:45,702
Arthur, are you going to do nothing
if your daughter's gone crazy?

370
00:22:45,903 --> 00:22:49,703
Oh, it's all your fault,
inviting him here to dinner.

371
00:22:56,004 --> 00:22:58,300
Dot, I can hardly believe it.

372
00:22:58,321 --> 00:23:00,670
I never thought he'd propose to you.

373
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,801
He didn't.
I proposed to him.

374
00:23:02,802 --> 00:23:05,902
Well, I'll be...

375
00:23:08,103 --> 00:23:10,600
Oh, Dad, it's alright with you,
isn't it?

376
00:23:10,629 --> 00:23:11,629
Can't I have him?

377
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,080
But just think, Dot, he couldn't
keep you in shoes.

378
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,350
You're accustomed to all this.
You'd never be able to give it up.

379
00:23:17,351 --> 00:23:19,331
- Well, I don't intend to.
- You'll have to.

380
00:23:19,352 --> 00:23:22,642
- He only earns 45 dollars a week.
- But you're going to raise his salary.

381
00:23:22,643 --> 00:23:23,900
- What?
- Dad,

382
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:26,401
I want him more than anything
in the world.

383
00:23:26,422 --> 00:23:28,502
Won't you please let me have him?

384
00:23:28,503 --> 00:23:31,000
Oh, you know that I'd do anything
to make you happy.

385
00:23:31,001 --> 00:23:33,381
Gee, you're a peach, Dad.
He's a good man.

386
00:23:33,402 --> 00:23:34,900
And you'll promote him, won't you?

387
00:23:34,921 --> 00:23:36,680
I'll have to, if you're going
to marry him.

388
00:23:36,699 --> 00:23:40,500
And don't forget, I can't get along on
a cent less than 50 thousand a year.

389
00:23:40,521 --> 00:23:41,771
- Fifty thousand?
- Hm-hmm.

390
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:45,880
Why, I couldn't possibly pay him that.
It would disrupt all my organization.

391
00:23:45,881 --> 00:23:48,200
- Aw, Dad.
- Now, don't worry.

392
00:23:48,401 --> 00:23:50,801
I'll give him a little raise in salary

393
00:23:51,602 --> 00:23:54,402
...and I'll make up the difference
out of my own pocket.

394
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,803
- Aw, thanks, Dad.
- But look here, Dot, now you be careful.

395
00:23:57,804 --> 00:24:01,900
A man has to be made of strong stuff,
not to let money spoil him.

396
00:24:01,921 --> 00:24:05,200
- Don't let it spoil Dick.
- Money spoil Dick?

397
00:24:05,231 --> 00:24:08,001
Oh, don't be silly.
It could never spoil Dick.

398
00:24:08,022 --> 00:24:10,302
- Well, I have to be going.
- Now, where are you going?

399
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,603
I promised Dick that I'd go right over
and tell him what you said.

400
00:24:12,604 --> 00:24:14,504
Bye, I'm in an awful hurry.

401
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:30,005
Oh, that's you, Hughie?

402
00:24:30,006 --> 00:24:33,500
- I guess so.
- Didn't Dick come home with you?

403
00:24:33,601 --> 00:24:37,000
Two's company, three's a crowd.

404
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:38,900
What are you talking about?

405
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:44,100
It won't be long now. Coming events
cast their shadows behind.

406
00:24:44,131 --> 00:24:45,701
Oh, go up and get ready for dinner.

407
00:24:45,732 --> 00:24:49,502
I guess if you knew what I know,
you'd believe in Santy Claus.

408
00:25:09,303 --> 00:25:11,903
Mother, I've got a surprise for you.

409
00:25:11,924 --> 00:25:14,100
A surprise?
What is it?

410
00:25:14,231 --> 00:25:15,901
I'm going to be married.

411
00:25:20,302 --> 00:25:21,902
Dick...

412
00:25:23,003 --> 00:25:24,603
Oh, that's wonderful.

413
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:29,034
Who is she?

414
00:25:29,055 --> 00:25:31,400
You just wait. She'll be here
in a minute and you'll see her.

415
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:34,531
I just knew something like this
was going to happen.

416
00:25:34,572 --> 00:25:36,450
I know you're going to love her, Mother.

417
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:38,751
Oh, I'll fix up the spare bedroom.

418
00:25:38,772 --> 00:25:39,999
- Spare bedroom?
- Yes.

419
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,600
You can have it until you move into
a home of your own.

420
00:25:42,691 --> 00:25:45,261
Oh, Dick, this is lovely.

421
00:25:45,262 --> 00:25:48,562
Imagine getting a daughter for
a Christmas present.

422
00:25:50,463 --> 00:25:52,963
- I wonder who that is.
- Must be Santa Claus.

423
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:06,400
A Christmas present for you, Mother.

424
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:09,200
Mother, this is Dorothy,
Dorothy Parker.

425
00:26:15,601 --> 00:26:18,881
You dear, dear child.

426
00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:19,899
Isn't she sweet?

427
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,700
- She certainly is.
- She certainly is.

428
00:26:23,401 --> 00:26:26,551
I don't know what I've done to deserve
the two best women in the world.

429
00:26:26,582 --> 00:26:28,952
Who told him he deserves us?

430
00:26:32,053 --> 00:26:36,653
Oh... let me go.
You hug like a bear.

431
00:26:39,054 --> 00:26:41,454
Will you excuse me a moment,
please?

432
00:26:44,055 --> 00:26:46,855
Oh, Dick, I'm terribly happy.
Everything's alright.

433
00:26:46,876 --> 00:26:49,156
And you don't know how glad
I am, kitten.

434
00:26:49,197 --> 00:26:51,557
- Kitten?
- Yeah, that's my pet name for you.

435
00:26:51,578 --> 00:26:53,280
Well, isn't that funny.

436
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:55,381
You know, Dad used to call me
that when I was a kid.

437
00:26:55,882 --> 00:26:57,200
Let's sit down.

438
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,151
Want to take your coat off?

439
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,900
Oh, no, Dick, I think we'd better
be going.

440
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:03,999
Alright.

441
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,500
Dear, I want you to have this.

442
00:27:13,301 --> 00:27:16,800
I wore it when I was young,
and my mother before me.

443
00:27:16,831 --> 00:27:19,701
It's supposed to bring good
fortune for the bride.

444
00:27:20,302 --> 00:27:23,802
Why, what a lovely old ring.
I'll wear it all the time.

445
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:27,303
Mrs. Brunton, I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this.

446
00:27:27,804 --> 00:27:30,800
I hope it brings you all the
happiness in the world.

447
00:27:30,821 --> 00:27:33,301
I don't want to rush, Mother,
but we've got a million things to do.

448
00:27:33,322 --> 00:27:35,102
Oh, that's alright, I understand.

449
00:27:38,203 --> 00:27:40,200
Dick's a wonderful boy.

450
00:27:40,601 --> 00:27:43,001
But all men are peculiar.

451
00:27:43,032 --> 00:27:46,402
You just handle him right
and you'll be very happy.

452
00:27:46,503 --> 00:27:48,503
Oh, I understand.

453
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:54,404
I'll be home early, Mother.

454
00:27:54,425 --> 00:27:55,800
Good night, Mrs. Brunton.

455
00:27:57,601 --> 00:27:58,501
Good night.

456
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:07,902
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

457
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:09,603
- Bye, Mother.
- Bye.

458
00:28:22,904 --> 00:28:25,000
Isn't that a beautiful car?

459
00:28:25,901 --> 00:28:29,401
I don't give it much.
It's last year's model.

460
00:28:54,602 --> 00:28:56,502
Well, Hughie, what do you think?

461
00:28:57,203 --> 00:29:01,300
I think he's a sap if he marries
a dame like her.

462
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:03,701
You'd never catch me doing that.

463
00:29:04,002 --> 00:29:06,702
Doggone if I'd slave for
a million bucks a week...

464
00:29:06,723 --> 00:29:10,053
...just to have some canary spend
it on brassieres.

465
00:29:11,454 --> 00:29:13,000
She's a nice girl.

466
00:29:13,091 --> 00:29:16,351
What's one man's meat
is another guy's poison.

467
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:22,252
I've heard of marriages made in heaven,
but not in the Parker Steel plant.

468
00:29:22,283 --> 00:29:24,253
Well, they're so devoted.

469
00:29:24,854 --> 00:29:27,900
- I think it'll work out all right.
- Don't kid yourself.

470
00:29:27,921 --> 00:29:31,101
I claim oil and water don't mix.

471
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:35,202
East is west and west is east
when Greek meets Greek.

472
00:30:19,303 --> 00:30:21,903
You were the loveliest bride.

473
00:30:21,934 --> 00:30:25,004
When you came down that aisle,
it just took my breath away.

474
00:30:25,035 --> 00:30:27,580
Will you forgive me for kidnapping
your son?

475
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:30,781
Of course, I know he's in good hands.

476
00:30:33,882 --> 00:30:37,782
Dick, you have the most wonderful
girl in the world.

477
00:30:37,883 --> 00:30:41,383
- See that you take good care of her.
- I will, Mother.

478
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:46,300
And don't you go shutting yourself in your
room every night like you did with me.

479
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:50,401
You know, Dick was always
terribly ambitious.

480
00:30:50,422 --> 00:30:53,302
Yes, I know.
Oh, I won't let him work too hard.

481
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:55,650
Oh well, I...

482
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:58,851
Guess I'd better run along. You're in
a hurry to get down to the boat and...

483
00:30:58,852 --> 00:31:01,552
I'll say good... goodbye.

484
00:31:14,053 --> 00:31:16,700
I'm going out to the car.
Will you come along with me?

485
00:31:28,401 --> 00:31:30,601
- Come on, Mother, dear.
- Goodbye, Dick.

486
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,402
God bless you both.

487
00:31:32,823 --> 00:31:34,303
Goodbye, Mother.

488
00:31:39,304 --> 00:31:40,604
Say, Dick.

489
00:31:42,205 --> 00:31:45,500
- Well, are you happy?
- Yes, sir.

490
00:31:45,651 --> 00:31:47,200
Well, I hope you're a good sailor,

491
00:31:47,221 --> 00:31:49,971
...because my yacht isn't quite as large
as the Leviathan.

492
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:53,101
Now, have a good time.
Lots of work for you when you come back.

493
00:31:53,122 --> 00:31:54,270
Oh, I'll be ready.

494
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:56,700
One thing more, Dick. You know,
girls are peculiar...

495
00:31:56,721 --> 00:31:58,450
...and you have to handle them
very carefully.

496
00:31:58,471 --> 00:32:01,000
Well, Dorothy and I, I think we
understand each other, Mr. Parker.

497
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:06,680
Yes, I know, but when little things crop up
as they will in best of families, well...

498
00:32:06,699 --> 00:32:09,900
you give in a bit and the woman
will give in a whole lot.

499
00:32:10,201 --> 00:32:11,301
I see.

500
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:15,202
Er... just some spending money
for your honeymoon.

501
00:32:20,003 --> 00:32:21,200
What?

502
00:32:21,221 --> 00:32:24,000
- Well, haven't you made some mistake?
- That's all right.

503
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:27,701
I want you both to remember your
honeymoon as long as you live.

504
00:32:27,702 --> 00:32:30,500
- But I can't...
- Now, you've turned down my check...

505
00:32:30,521 --> 00:32:32,551
...once for saving some lives.

506
00:32:32,572 --> 00:32:34,402
I want this one to remind you...

507
00:32:34,423 --> 00:32:38,703
...that I'm entrusting you with
the most precious life in the world.

508
00:32:46,804 --> 00:32:48,700
Well... thank you, Mr. Parker.

509
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:11,001
Come in.

510
00:33:12,602 --> 00:33:14,802
Hello, Dick.
Isn't it funny?

511
00:33:14,823 --> 00:33:16,703
That door connects both our rooms.

512
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:19,600
Oh, please come in,
so I can really believe it.

513
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:21,701
It still seems like a dream.

514
00:33:22,602 --> 00:33:26,202
- Oh, you're nothing but a kid.
- And you're nothing but a kitten.

515
00:33:26,243 --> 00:33:30,003
It's been a strenuous day, getting
married and running off to the yacht.

516
00:33:30,064 --> 00:33:34,004
So I think I'll retire.
Good night.

517
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:35,605
Husband.

518
00:33:45,306 --> 00:33:47,006
See you in the morning?

519
00:33:48,807 --> 00:33:49,999
Good night.

520
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,200
Kitten.

521
00:34:19,241 --> 00:34:21,101
- You're asleep?
- Hm-hmm.

522
00:34:57,202 --> 00:34:59,999
Oh, c'est charmant!

523
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:03,700
C'est charmant, madame.
You look marvelous in it!

524
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:06,600
And this, Mme. Brunton, I have
shown to no one else.

525
00:35:06,631 --> 00:35:09,201
For no one else could wear it
as you can.

526
00:35:09,262 --> 00:35:11,962
Is that the kind of a woman
you think I am?

527
00:35:11,983 --> 00:35:15,563
Oh, not that you are, but that
you should look on occasion.

528
00:35:17,064 --> 00:35:18,164
Oh...

529
00:35:24,265 --> 00:35:25,965
What's that, Prinz?

530
00:35:29,366 --> 00:35:31,000
But I didn't order a coat.

531
00:35:31,021 --> 00:35:33,201
But I knew you will after
you saw this.

532
00:35:33,202 --> 00:35:36,600
- Oh, it's magnificent.
- It was smuggled out of Russia...

533
00:35:36,621 --> 00:35:38,301
...a few skins at a time.

534
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,500
Don't tempt me, Prinz, we're
almost broke.

535
00:35:42,701 --> 00:35:45,101
But when your husband
sees you in this...

536
00:35:45,162 --> 00:35:49,300
oh-ha-ha-ha, he will not think
of the expense.

537
00:35:49,331 --> 00:35:53,401
Oh-ha-ha-ha, I'll try it on,
but I won't take it.

538
00:35:57,402 --> 00:36:00,102
Oh, it's beautiful, Dorothea.

539
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:02,703
- It is...
- C'est magnifique, magnifique!

540
00:36:02,734 --> 00:36:04,104
What's the bad news, Prinz?

541
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:07,800
Oh... only 200.000 francs.

542
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:10,900
Good heavens, I can't afford that.

543
00:36:10,901 --> 00:36:14,501
Afford? Ten thousand dollars
for a coat like this?

544
00:36:14,552 --> 00:36:15,902
Madame!

545
00:36:15,953 --> 00:36:18,903
Really, you frighten me when
you say it in francs.

546
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:22,404
But put that way, it does
seem sort of, er...

547
00:36:59,205 --> 00:37:01,305
- There you are.
- Merci bien, madame.

548
00:37:01,336 --> 00:37:04,606
- Merci beaucoup. Au revoir, madame.
- Au revoir.

549
00:37:07,407 --> 00:37:09,607
- Au revoir, madame.
- Au revoir.

550
00:37:10,908 --> 00:37:12,808
Au revoir, mesdames.

551
00:37:12,909 --> 00:37:14,609
Au revoir, monsieur.

552
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:18,710
- Do you really like it?
- I think it's perfectly stunning.

553
00:37:18,811 --> 00:37:20,011
I do.

554
00:37:21,112 --> 00:37:23,100
Oh, Dick, come here. I want
to show you something.

555
00:37:23,133 --> 00:37:26,400
- Dick, where's Llewellyn?
- Why...

556
00:37:26,431 --> 00:37:28,800
Why, he's downstairs, I think he'll
be up in a moment.

557
00:37:29,501 --> 00:37:30,901
Entrez.

558
00:37:36,502 --> 00:37:40,202
Oh! Oh, my Pansy is dying!

559
00:37:40,243 --> 00:37:42,503
Oh... oh, my baby!

560
00:37:42,534 --> 00:37:45,500
What happened to my beautiful baby?

561
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:47,901
Oh, my darling baby.

562
00:37:47,902 --> 00:37:50,200
- Oh...
- Listen, darling, I can explain...

563
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:53,280
Oh, I thought at least you could take
care of my dog to earn your living.

564
00:37:53,299 --> 00:37:55,181
- I know, pet...
- Don't talk to me!

565
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:57,200
You're not fit for anything!
You're not a man!

566
00:37:57,221 --> 00:38:00,380
- You're just what everybody calls you.
- Now, pet, please let me explain...

567
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,700
Get out of my sight, you...

568
00:38:02,843 --> 00:38:04,300
You worm!

569
00:38:04,341 --> 00:38:06,001
Alright, pet.

570
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:07,402
Oh!

571
00:38:08,303 --> 00:38:10,303
Aren't you a little rough
on him, Lucille?

572
00:38:11,004 --> 00:38:13,104
What do you think I give him
his allowance for?

573
00:38:13,105 --> 00:38:15,405
Look at my darling, just look at him.

574
00:38:15,406 --> 00:38:18,606
Can't the poor sap do anything
to earn his money?

575
00:38:19,107 --> 00:38:21,807
Just look at my darling!
Just look at her!

576
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:24,108
Oh, you don't understand
what I've been through.

577
00:38:24,149 --> 00:38:26,409
Just wait until I get him alone.

578
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:30,250
I'm awfully sorry this had
to happen, Dick.

579
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:33,800
I'll see you again later.
Good night.

580
00:38:34,401 --> 00:38:39,500
Where's mother's little baby girl?
Getting hurt by that nasty, mean old man.

581
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:42,300
Just wait till Mother gets home
to that man.

582
00:38:51,901 --> 00:38:55,301
- Dick, how did you like the coat?
- Don't try and change the subject.

583
00:38:55,322 --> 00:38:57,702
Disgusting, wasn't it?
I'm through with her.

584
00:38:57,733 --> 00:38:59,203
That's all right.
You know what I mean.

585
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:01,304
Kept husband there.

586
00:39:01,335 --> 00:39:04,005
If you apply that to yourself,
it's an insult to me.

587
00:39:04,026 --> 00:39:06,400
Well, that's what I am,
until we get home.

588
00:39:06,421 --> 00:39:07,900
You're making me angry!

589
00:39:26,001 --> 00:39:28,380
Oh, please don't be angry
with me, Dot.

590
00:39:28,401 --> 00:39:31,001
Well, if you promise not to say
things like that anymore, I...

591
00:39:31,032 --> 00:39:32,380
I've got to get back to work.

592
00:39:32,399 --> 00:39:36,170
But look, we haven't been to Deauville,
Nice, Monte Carlo or Biarritz.

593
00:39:36,191 --> 00:39:38,471
Why, that's the best part of
our honeymoon.

594
00:39:38,499 --> 00:39:41,500
- Road work can keep.
- How about keeping my self-respect?

595
00:39:41,521 --> 00:39:44,001
Oh, why can't we stay over
here longer?

596
00:39:44,022 --> 00:39:47,102
Why, a few more months won't
do any harm.

597
00:39:47,503 --> 00:39:49,203
Well...

598
00:39:55,004 --> 00:39:57,204
- What are you whistling about?
- Well, this coat.

599
00:39:57,235 --> 00:39:59,705
Two hundred thousand dollars,
that's ten thousand dollars.

600
00:39:59,706 --> 00:40:02,400
- Well, it's worth it?
- Well, where's the money coming from?

601
00:40:02,426 --> 00:40:05,106
Oh, don't be so dense. All you have
to do is cable Father.

602
00:40:05,127 --> 00:40:08,107
- I've cabled him three times already.
- And he hasn't turned us down once.

603
00:40:08,128 --> 00:40:10,108
Well, I'm not going to keep on
hitting him for more.

604
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:13,609
- Not if I ask you?
- Aw, please don't ask me.

605
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:17,910
You know I've got to get back to work.
I've got to start earning a living.

606
00:40:17,931 --> 00:40:19,611
But there's no rush.

607
00:40:19,632 --> 00:40:23,500
Now, your father's been wonderful, but I'm
not going to impose on him any longer.

608
00:40:30,001 --> 00:40:31,700
But we've got to go back.

609
00:40:32,701 --> 00:40:34,901
Oh, Dot, what's the matter?

610
00:40:34,902 --> 00:40:37,000
You know very well your old
work can wait.

611
00:40:37,021 --> 00:40:39,100
But it isn't right.
We've got to go back.

612
00:40:39,301 --> 00:40:43,900
First we're going to Deauville, Nice,
Monte Carlo and Biarritz.

613
00:40:43,921 --> 00:40:47,800
No, we're not going to Deauville,
Nice, Monte Carlo and Biarritz.

614
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:49,501
We're going home!

615
00:42:14,602 --> 00:42:16,302
Well, how do you like it?

616
00:42:16,303 --> 00:42:18,900
- Well, it's fine, but...
- But what, sweet?

617
00:42:18,941 --> 00:42:22,480
It's alright for people who like this sort
of thing, but we won't stay here long.

618
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:23,700
Why, what do you mean?

619
00:42:23,731 --> 00:42:26,001
Tomorrow you and I will go looking
for a little apartment.

620
00:42:26,032 --> 00:42:28,300
Say, that's right. I'd forgotten
all about that.

621
00:42:28,321 --> 00:42:30,600
We do need a little place in town.

622
00:42:30,601 --> 00:42:33,501
- Say, what are we driving at?
- Don't you know where we are?

623
00:42:33,652 --> 00:42:35,400
We're home!

624
00:42:35,421 --> 00:42:39,100
- Home? Our home?
- Yes, I've been saving it for a surprise.

625
00:42:39,191 --> 00:42:41,500
Surprise!
Surprise!

626
00:42:54,101 --> 00:42:56,001
A little cheer for the homecoming.

627
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,802
To the homecoming!

628
00:43:00,853 --> 00:43:03,453
Jolly times and happy moments.

629
00:43:03,494 --> 00:43:05,554
Hooray!

630
00:43:08,555 --> 00:43:11,200
They're both too happy
for words, Hughie.

631
00:43:11,601 --> 00:43:15,601
Isn't it wonderful to think they've
been in every spot in Europe?

632
00:43:15,652 --> 00:43:19,552
England, France, Germany,
Italy, Switzerland.

633
00:43:19,573 --> 00:43:20,599
Everywhere.

634
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,500
Yeah. Well, I don't want
to discourage you.

635
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:26,701
But a rolling stone gathers
no moss.

636
00:43:27,202 --> 00:43:29,800
Dick has a wonderful wife.

637
00:43:29,831 --> 00:43:31,401
I'm so glad.

638
00:43:33,602 --> 00:43:36,002
Didn't they ask you over
to the house?

639
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:38,703
This is their first night in their
new home...

640
00:43:38,734 --> 00:43:41,200
...and they want to be alone,
and quiet.

641
00:43:53,401 --> 00:43:56,300
Well, Mr. Parker, I'm ready
to go back on the job.

642
00:43:56,331 --> 00:43:58,501
That's great. I'm glad to hear it.

643
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:03,450
We've got a fine office for you, son,
and we're going to keep you mighty busy.

644
00:44:03,481 --> 00:44:04,681
Well that's great.

645
00:44:04,999 --> 00:44:06,982
Well, we've got to be going.

646
00:44:15,483 --> 00:44:17,483
I'm going to say good night, Dick.

647
00:44:17,784 --> 00:44:20,000
You see, I think you and Dot
ought to be alone.

648
00:44:20,031 --> 00:44:22,501
Oh, by the way, where is Dot?
I want to say good night.

649
00:44:22,522 --> 00:44:23,802
Well, I don't know.

650
00:44:23,803 --> 00:44:25,800
Well, never mind, I'll see her
again later.

651
00:44:25,824 --> 00:44:26,824
Alright.

652
00:44:26,825 --> 00:44:28,965
Come, Llewellyn, we must go.
Good night.

653
00:44:28,986 --> 00:44:30,016
Good night.

654
00:44:30,057 --> 00:44:32,317
Well, Dick, we'll have to go too.

655
00:44:32,718 --> 00:44:35,518
Tell me, how did the boyfriend
behave?

656
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:37,370
Did he sleep in his overalls?

657
00:44:37,371 --> 00:44:39,200
What do you care what he slept in?

658
00:44:39,351 --> 00:44:41,601
Can't you do anything besides
knock people?

659
00:44:42,402 --> 00:44:44,402
Now, listen, Dot, you think
you're kidding me.

660
00:44:44,503 --> 00:44:46,803
But you're only kidding yourself.

661
00:44:46,804 --> 00:44:49,280
About Dick?
Oh, you're crazy.

662
00:44:49,299 --> 00:44:51,251
Oh, this marriage can't last.

663
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:53,702
I've never seen one that could,
and you know it's true.

664
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:56,600
- But Dick and I are different.
- I know.

665
00:44:56,621 --> 00:44:58,870
But he just doesn't belong
with this crowd.

666
00:44:58,899 --> 00:45:01,780
Don't worry about him. He will before
I get through with him.

667
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:05,600
Oh, you're going to have a tough
time making a tea hound out of that, er...

668
00:45:05,621 --> 00:45:08,251
What do you call him...
Oh, yes, steel boss.

669
00:45:08,552 --> 00:45:09,652
What's the matter?

670
00:45:09,653 --> 00:45:13,000
- If you don't stop riding Dick...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

671
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:15,101
Won't you forgive me?

672
00:45:15,102 --> 00:45:19,202
- Yes. But it won't happen again.
- It won't. I promise.

673
00:45:19,403 --> 00:45:21,403
Cross my heart, right?

674
00:45:22,004 --> 00:45:24,600
Now listen, just to prove
that we're still good friends,

675
00:45:24,631 --> 00:45:26,601
how about a little kiss?

676
00:45:26,602 --> 00:45:28,202
Just one, Charlie.

677
00:45:34,703 --> 00:45:36,103
Uh-oh!

678
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,104
Aren't you forgetting your friends?

679
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:45,600
They're all going home.

680
00:45:45,641 --> 00:45:47,401
Well, if that's the case, I guess
I'd better go along.

681
00:45:47,802 --> 00:45:49,902
- Good night, Dot.
- Good night, Charlie.

682
00:45:50,503 --> 00:45:51,803
Good night, Dick.

683
00:45:52,904 --> 00:45:55,104
Sorry, Dick. I'll bid them
good night.

684
00:46:02,505 --> 00:46:05,305
- Good night, Dot.
- Good night. Good night.

685
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,200
- Good night, Llewellyn.
- Good night.

686
00:46:11,801 --> 00:46:13,101
- Good night.
- Good night, Dick.

687
00:46:13,132 --> 00:46:14,450
- Good night, Dot.
- Good night.

688
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:16,751
- We had a lovely time.
- That's good. Come again, will you?

689
00:46:35,452 --> 00:46:38,252
Well? What have you got
to say for yourself?

690
00:46:38,273 --> 00:46:40,923
- Wasn't it a swell party?
- You know what I mean.

691
00:46:40,924 --> 00:46:43,424
- No. What?
- Your necking with Bates.

692
00:46:43,445 --> 00:46:46,975
Oh, Dick, don't be silly.
I've known Charlie all my life.

693
00:46:46,999 --> 00:46:48,600
That doesn't make any difference.

694
00:46:48,621 --> 00:46:50,600
You don't mean to tell me
you're jealous.

695
00:46:51,501 --> 00:46:54,780
You just bet I am. I don't care
very much for Mr. Bates.

696
00:46:54,799 --> 00:46:57,881
Now look, Charlie's alright.
Now don't go worrying about that.

697
00:46:57,882 --> 00:47:00,800
Listen, Dot, don't let it ever
happen again.

698
00:47:00,801 --> 00:47:04,000
Of course I won't, if you feel
that way about it.

699
00:47:05,201 --> 00:47:07,570
Come on, now. Let's go and
inspect the house, huh?

700
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:09,800
Now wait a minute.
We can't stay here.

701
00:47:09,821 --> 00:47:11,050
- Why not?
- It isn't right.

702
00:47:11,072 --> 00:47:13,140
It's too much. Your father's been
too kind to us.

703
00:47:13,161 --> 00:47:15,941
Besides, I could never support
this place on my salary.

704
00:47:16,142 --> 00:47:18,702
- Is that all that's bothering you?
- Yes.

705
00:47:18,723 --> 00:47:21,003
And that's why we're going
into a smaller place.

706
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:24,204
Oh, Dick.
Oh, I'd be so disappointed.

707
00:47:24,225 --> 00:47:27,250
- Why, I planned everything.
- I know, dear, but...

708
00:47:27,271 --> 00:47:31,051
Now look, Dick. What would everybody
say if we left this house?

709
00:47:32,252 --> 00:47:36,452
Aw, Dick, you'll do this for your
little kitten, won't you?

710
00:47:49,053 --> 00:47:51,253
Oh, I'd do anything in the world
for you.

711
00:47:52,254 --> 00:47:53,354
Oh...

712
00:48:13,255 --> 00:48:16,155
Hello, Hughie. How's everything
at the factory?

713
00:48:16,656 --> 00:48:19,956
Sufficient unto the day is
the evil thereafter.

714
00:48:20,657 --> 00:48:22,257
Why, what do you mean?

715
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:25,558
That son of yours is getting
pretty high-hat.

716
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:29,059
Well, a friend in need is
a friend indeed.

717
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,460
Why? What has Dick done?

718
00:48:31,481 --> 00:48:34,581
It ain't what he's done, it's what
he ain't done.

719
00:48:34,582 --> 00:48:37,582
He won't even get me that job
as boss puddler.

720
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:40,460
Well, I do more work around there
now than he does.

721
00:48:40,481 --> 00:48:41,800
He don't do nothing.

722
00:48:41,821 --> 00:48:44,900
- He's the joke of the joint.
- Oh, now, Hughie, I'm sure...

723
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:49,200
Well, he won't high-hat this baby
any longer. I'm through with him.

724
00:48:49,601 --> 00:48:53,101
We are known by the company
we do not keep.

725
00:49:18,603 --> 00:49:21,600
- Good morning.
- Any calls?

726
00:49:21,704 --> 00:49:24,104
Yes, Mr. Parker's been trying
to get you all morning.

727
00:49:24,155 --> 00:49:25,705
Said he'd call after lunch.

728
00:49:25,736 --> 00:49:28,306
And Mrs. Brunton called.
Said she'd call back.

729
00:49:28,347 --> 00:49:29,700
Hm, fine.

730
00:50:01,201 --> 00:50:02,401
Hello?

731
00:50:02,552 --> 00:50:04,252
Oh, yes, just a moment, please.

732
00:50:04,253 --> 00:50:06,800
- Mrs. Brunton on the wire, Mr. Brunton.
- Thank you.

733
00:50:09,501 --> 00:50:11,001
Hello, kitten.

734
00:50:11,032 --> 00:50:14,702
I just wanted to remind you, dear,
I'll meet you at the recital at 2:30.

735
00:50:14,733 --> 00:50:17,003
And don't forget we're due
at the Ritz at five.

736
00:50:17,094 --> 00:50:21,104
Oh, yes, and Rose Clayton is giving us that
big dinner party at the club tonight.

737
00:50:23,705 --> 00:50:25,405
All right.

738
00:50:25,806 --> 00:50:27,206
Goodbye, sweetheart.

739
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,307
Any orders, Mr. Brunton?

740
00:50:32,999 --> 00:50:37,508
Due at the recital at 2:30,
the Ritz at five and...

741
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,609
Never mind about that.

742
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:51,710
Well, Dick.
Well, I've got big news for you.

743
00:50:51,731 --> 00:50:53,770
- Is that so?
- Been looking for you all morning.

744
00:50:53,791 --> 00:50:57,271
- I'm sorry, I didn't feel very well.
- Oh, that's all right.

745
00:50:57,272 --> 00:51:00,352
You still think Barber's idea about
that bridge is practical?

746
00:51:00,373 --> 00:51:01,473
I know it is.

747
00:51:01,494 --> 00:51:03,694
And you know it's against all
theories of engineering.

748
00:51:03,715 --> 00:51:05,795
Yes, but this bridge won't be built
on theories.

749
00:51:05,826 --> 00:51:09,800
It'll be built on brains, and imagination,
and concrete and steel.

750
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:11,900
Why, look at this.

751
00:51:12,601 --> 00:51:15,041
Now, when Barber planned to put
those steel girdles...

752
00:51:15,062 --> 00:51:17,042
That's all right, that's far enough.

753
00:51:17,063 --> 00:51:20,170
I just wanted to know if you were
still sold on the idea.

754
00:51:20,199 --> 00:51:22,771
- More than ever.
- Fine, that's just the way I feel.

755
00:51:22,792 --> 00:51:24,672
Now, what I want to tell you is this.

756
00:51:24,699 --> 00:51:28,800
I've made up my mind to take
the biggest gamble of my life.

757
00:51:28,801 --> 00:51:32,501
I am going to win this contract
with that bridge.

758
00:51:32,802 --> 00:51:35,602
You'll never make it. You know
what you're up against, don't you?

759
00:51:36,003 --> 00:51:38,950
A bunch of old fogies who can't
see anything new or original.

760
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:43,351
Yes... The thing I need most is a man
who knows this idea from every angle.

761
00:51:43,372 --> 00:51:46,300
A man who will set them afire
with his own enthusiasm.

762
00:51:46,321 --> 00:51:50,500
A man who gets whatever he goes after
no matter how tough the opposition.

763
00:51:51,102 --> 00:51:54,902
You mean Barber?
- No, he's an inventor, I want a salesman.

764
00:51:54,943 --> 00:51:58,800
The man I've picked up
to put this thing over is...

765
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:00,700
- You.
- Me?

766
00:52:00,722 --> 00:52:02,800
Yes, if you can sell a hard-boiled
egg like me,

767
00:52:02,821 --> 00:52:04,531
...you can certainly sell those
St. Louis folks.

768
00:52:04,552 --> 00:52:06,870
- You bet I can.
- Of course you can!

769
00:52:06,899 --> 00:52:11,201
All you need to do is put that old fighting
football spirit into it and you can't fail.

770
00:52:11,222 --> 00:52:12,682
Don't you worry, I won't fail you.

771
00:52:12,699 --> 00:52:16,680
- Why, son, it's the chance of a lifetime.
- I know it is. I'll catch the next train.

772
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,900
Oh, now, take it easy.
Time enough for that tonight.

773
00:52:18,901 --> 00:52:23,000
What we'll do, we'll spend this afternoon
going over this thing from A to Z...

774
00:52:23,021 --> 00:52:25,040
...so there won't be any chance
of a slip up.

775
00:52:25,061 --> 00:52:27,320
Oh, boy, just wait till I tell Dot.

776
00:52:27,341 --> 00:52:30,300
Won't she be proud to know
that you gave me this big job?

777
00:52:31,722 --> 00:52:33,982
- How long will I be away?
- About two weeks.

778
00:52:35,083 --> 00:52:37,083
- Great, I'll take her with me.
- Fine.

779
00:52:37,084 --> 00:52:40,500
Now come on. We'll go over to the office
and go through this thing thoroughly.

780
00:52:40,561 --> 00:52:41,701
Alright.

781
00:52:45,202 --> 00:52:46,802
That's fine, Mary.

782
00:52:47,503 --> 00:52:50,900
By the way, did Mr. Brunton call
and say he'd be detained?

783
00:52:50,931 --> 00:52:52,601
No. No, madame.

784
00:52:57,802 --> 00:52:59,000
Dot!

785
00:53:01,101 --> 00:53:02,201
Dot!

786
00:53:05,402 --> 00:53:08,702
- Oh, Dot, I've got the grandest news.
- Good heavens, where've you been?

787
00:53:08,703 --> 00:53:11,500
- Oh, my gosh, I forgot to call you.
- Yes.

788
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:14,600
You didn't come to the recital.
You didn't show up at the Ritz.

789
00:53:14,652 --> 00:53:18,102
And here it is, nearly 8 o'clock, and you
know very well we're due at that party.

790
00:53:18,123 --> 00:53:20,980
Oh, but wait.
Gee, your father's a grand old scout.

791
00:53:20,999 --> 00:53:23,160
He's given me the biggest job
in the history of the company.

792
00:53:23,181 --> 00:53:25,600
- You can tell me all about it later.
- No, I can't.

793
00:53:25,621 --> 00:53:27,201
We're leaving for St. Louis tonight.

794
00:53:27,402 --> 00:53:29,452
- What?
- Sure, you and I.

795
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,600
Have you gone out of your head?

796
00:53:31,621 --> 00:53:34,301
Of course I have. Now come on
and get your things packed.

797
00:53:40,502 --> 00:53:44,002
Have you forgotten the Claytons are giving
a dinner in our honor at the club tonight?

798
00:53:44,043 --> 00:53:46,500
Oh, dickens with the dinner.
We're shoving off for St. Louis.

799
00:54:21,201 --> 00:54:23,701
Aw, kitten.
What's the matter?

800
00:54:23,752 --> 00:54:27,002
Matter? Well, of all the crazy stunts.
Going to St. Louis.

801
00:54:27,033 --> 00:54:29,000
I'll give father a piece of my mind.

802
00:54:29,021 --> 00:54:30,901
But, kitten, it's a chance of a lifetime.

803
00:54:30,932 --> 00:54:33,602
It'll be a good trip for you and
a nice change for two weeks.

804
00:54:33,633 --> 00:54:37,003
Two weeks? At the top of the season?
What a chance.

805
00:54:37,504 --> 00:54:39,360
Aw, it'll be like a second honeymoon.

806
00:54:39,381 --> 00:54:42,000
Well, I've decided you're not to go.
That's all there is to it.

807
00:54:46,201 --> 00:54:49,201
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'll tell Dad a thing or two.

808
00:54:49,232 --> 00:54:51,202
Riverside 6826.

809
00:54:52,203 --> 00:54:54,003
- Oh, give me that!
- Oh, no.

810
00:54:54,904 --> 00:54:57,000
I'm going to St. Louis and you're
going with me.

811
00:54:57,021 --> 00:54:59,600
With a book full of engagements?
I guess not.

812
00:54:59,621 --> 00:55:01,601
Well, then it looks like I'll have
to go alone.

813
00:55:01,602 --> 00:55:04,702
Oh... and you'd leave me all alone
for two weeks?

814
00:55:04,733 --> 00:55:06,703
I can't help it.
Business is business.

815
00:55:07,204 --> 00:55:09,900
And you think more of business
than you do about me?

816
00:55:09,921 --> 00:55:11,700
Now, you know it isn't that at all.

817
00:55:11,721 --> 00:55:15,501
- Oh, don't let's quarrel about it.
- I don't want to quarrel either, dear.

818
00:55:15,522 --> 00:55:17,999
You do love your little kittens,
don't you?

819
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,200
And you won't go away and leave
your little kittens...

820
00:55:20,221 --> 00:55:22,230
...all alone for two weeks,
will you?

821
00:55:22,251 --> 00:55:23,900
Oh, I do love you, Dot.

822
00:55:26,221 --> 00:55:27,600
But I've got to go.

823
00:55:27,601 --> 00:55:30,500
- Well, go, if you want to.
- Oh, now, be reasonable.

824
00:55:30,501 --> 00:55:33,601
Be reasonable, huh? Go to St. Louis.
Don't let me keep you.

825
00:55:33,632 --> 00:55:36,002
I'll find someone who'll be glad
to take me out.

826
00:55:36,003 --> 00:55:38,003
- Oh, now, listen.
- No.

827
00:56:21,604 --> 00:56:23,604
Aren't you going to say
goodbye, Dot?

828
00:56:33,305 --> 00:56:34,605
Goodbye.

829
00:56:50,506 --> 00:56:52,706
Then go to St. Louis!

830
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,307
Dick.

831
00:57:05,608 --> 00:57:09,300
You don't mean to tell me
you left her crying.

832
00:57:10,331 --> 00:57:12,801
Think I'm ashamed of you.

833
00:57:12,802 --> 00:57:15,680
- Can't you see it wasn't my fault?
- Oh, wasn't it?

834
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:19,001
She made her plans and you rushed in
without warning and upset them.

835
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:21,602
- But mine were more important.
- Oh, yes, to you.

836
00:57:21,603 --> 00:57:24,803
But her plans might have been
just as important to her.

837
00:57:25,304 --> 00:57:27,504
Oh... I never thought of that.

838
00:57:27,505 --> 00:57:29,900
Now you go on right home and
smooth it over.

839
00:57:30,601 --> 00:57:32,301
But I can't, I haven't time.

840
00:57:32,302 --> 00:57:36,202
You've got to find time.
You can't leave her like this.

841
00:57:36,223 --> 00:57:38,203
Why, there's no telling what
might happen.

842
00:57:38,224 --> 00:57:40,000
A high-spirited girl like her.

843
00:57:40,021 --> 00:57:41,501
Well, what could I do?

844
00:57:42,602 --> 00:57:46,202
Take her in your arms and ask
her to forgive you.

845
00:57:46,233 --> 00:57:49,700
- And give up the trip?
- You won't have to give up anything.

846
00:57:49,731 --> 00:57:53,301
But be fair to her. Don't ask her
to give up anything either.

847
00:57:53,332 --> 00:57:54,802
But what if she insists?

848
00:57:54,823 --> 00:58:00,230
Just take her in your arms
the right way and she won't insist.

849
00:58:00,381 --> 00:58:04,981
I'll bet you'll find her all packed up
and waiting for you to ask her.

850
00:58:07,182 --> 00:58:10,100
Oh, you look lovely in
that gown, madam.

851
00:58:10,121 --> 00:58:12,101
I've been saving it for a
special occasion.

852
00:58:15,702 --> 00:58:17,000
Hello?

853
00:58:17,151 --> 00:58:19,601
It's Mr. Bates, madam.
- Oh, let me talk to him.

854
00:58:21,202 --> 00:58:22,302
Hello, Charlie?

855
00:58:22,303 --> 00:58:24,103
I'll phone Dorothy right away,
Mother.

856
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:29,804
Carlton 8831.

857
00:58:29,835 --> 00:58:31,305
Now you be nice to her.

858
00:58:38,706 --> 00:58:40,406
Well, when am I going to see you?

859
00:58:41,007 --> 00:58:43,000
I'll see you over at the party tonight.

860
00:58:46,701 --> 00:58:49,101
- What's the matter?
- The line's busy.

861
00:58:50,002 --> 00:58:51,300
I know what I'll do.

862
00:58:51,301 --> 00:58:53,301
I'll run home and catch her
before she leaves.

863
00:58:54,802 --> 00:58:56,202
Now don't you worry.

864
00:59:07,303 --> 00:59:10,503
- Is Mrs. Brunton upstairs?
- No, sir, she just left.

865
00:59:21,204 --> 00:59:26,404
Hello? Give me Lakewood 6522...
please.

866
00:59:29,005 --> 00:59:30,805
Hello, ready to go in?

867
00:59:33,006 --> 00:59:34,306
Hello?

868
00:59:34,507 --> 00:59:36,400
Is this the Lakewiew Country Club?

869
00:59:36,701 --> 00:59:39,501
Mrs. Brunton will be there shortly
with the Clayton party.

870
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:41,502
I wonder if you'd have
her call her home.

871
00:59:41,653 --> 00:59:44,803
- Yes, Mr. Brunton, as soon as she comes in.
- Thank you.

872
00:59:52,404 --> 00:59:54,500
- Say when.
- All right.

873
00:59:54,601 --> 00:59:55,801
When!

874
01:00:01,002 --> 01:00:02,902
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

875
01:00:11,003 --> 01:00:12,500
Give us a little toast, Dot.

876
01:00:12,501 --> 01:00:14,301
- Know any new ones?
- No, I don't.

877
01:00:16,302 --> 01:00:17,802
Pardon me a moment.

878
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,800
Uh... I didn't want any intruders
coming in.

879
01:00:36,801 --> 01:00:39,801
Well, well, the old ten-twenty-thirty
stuff, eh?

880
01:00:39,822 --> 01:00:41,200
Surely, why not?

881
01:00:42,101 --> 01:00:44,000
Well, here's to you.

882
01:00:44,151 --> 01:00:46,180
Here's to both of us.

883
01:00:46,199 --> 01:00:47,300
Let it go.

884
01:00:54,301 --> 01:00:57,101
- How about some more?
- Fine.

885
01:01:03,602 --> 01:01:06,302
Give me Lakewood 6522.

886
01:01:07,403 --> 01:01:08,603
Yes.

887
01:01:12,204 --> 01:01:14,800
- Hello?
- Is this the Lakeview Country Club?

888
01:01:15,301 --> 01:01:17,101
Well, this is Mr. Brunton speaking.

889
01:01:17,122 --> 01:01:18,900
Mrs. Brunton is there with the
Clayton party,

890
01:01:18,921 --> 01:01:20,700
I wonder if you'd call her
to the phone.

891
01:01:20,721 --> 01:01:23,500
I'm sorry, sir, the Clayton party
has been called off.

892
01:01:23,601 --> 01:01:24,801
Called off?

893
01:01:26,402 --> 01:01:28,302
Well, is Mrs. Brunton there?

894
01:01:28,399 --> 01:01:31,200
No, sir. She just left with
Mr. Bates.

895
01:02:01,701 --> 01:02:06,600
The sound of the gong denoted
exactly 2 a.m., Eastern Standard Time...

896
01:02:06,601 --> 01:02:09,201
...and marks the conclusion of
our program.

897
01:02:09,252 --> 01:02:12,302
Good night, pleasant dreams.

898
01:02:18,303 --> 01:02:20,500
Is that right, 2 o'clock?

899
01:02:20,501 --> 01:02:22,801
Oh, the evening is still early.

900
01:02:22,832 --> 01:02:24,702
Really, Charlie, I'd better be
trotting along.

901
01:02:24,733 --> 01:02:28,403
You know, I'm terribly disappointed
in you.

902
01:02:28,424 --> 01:02:29,620
- Yes?
- Hm-hmm.

903
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:32,300
Well, we'll certainly have
to fix that.

904
01:02:33,501 --> 01:02:36,200
I thought you had lots more finesse.

905
01:02:36,201 --> 01:02:40,450
I suppose your big he-man taught you
all the fine points of the game.

906
01:02:40,451 --> 01:02:43,251
Oh, never mind about him.
Get my things.

907
01:02:43,272 --> 01:02:45,000
I'm bored stiff.

908
01:02:45,001 --> 01:02:47,401
I thought sure you'd give
me a thrill.

909
01:02:47,422 --> 01:02:51,142
Don't worry, darling, you're going
to get your thrill.

910
01:02:51,163 --> 01:02:53,643
Don't play so rough, Charlie.

911
01:02:53,664 --> 01:02:55,900
You're a cute little kitten.

912
01:02:55,951 --> 01:02:57,501
Kitten?

913
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,702
Kitten? Why, you're a little hellcat.

914
01:03:08,703 --> 01:03:11,403
Ah, the perils of the big city.

915
01:03:11,444 --> 01:03:13,600
Isn't any working girl safe?

916
01:03:13,631 --> 01:03:16,271
Not with this fiend in human form.

917
01:03:16,282 --> 01:03:21,472
Unhand me, Jack Dalton.
Think of my reputation, pulease.

918
01:03:23,773 --> 01:03:25,473
Just think of mine.

919
01:03:25,499 --> 01:03:28,274
Why, if I let you go it would be
fatal to my reputation.

920
01:03:29,075 --> 01:03:30,575
Wait, wait!

921
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:34,000
If you come one step nearer,
I'll plunge this dagger in my heart.

922
01:03:34,001 --> 01:03:36,101
Alright, clown if you want to,
but don't forget.

923
01:03:36,132 --> 01:03:38,602
The villain still pursues her.

924
01:03:38,603 --> 01:03:42,203
- Ah-ha!
- No, honestly, Charlie, you slay me.

925
01:03:42,234 --> 01:03:45,004
- Your technique is rotten.
- Yes?

926
01:03:45,005 --> 01:03:47,605
Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.

927
01:03:48,606 --> 01:03:50,706
Wait, what am I supposed to do now?

928
01:03:50,757 --> 01:03:52,007
Scream, I know.

929
01:03:52,038 --> 01:03:53,808
How loud can you scream?

930
01:03:54,509 --> 01:03:56,309
Not loud enough.

931
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:59,410
Will the marines never come?

932
01:04:01,011 --> 01:04:02,200
Halt! Halt! What's that?

933
01:04:04,401 --> 01:04:07,001
It's the United States Cavalry, boys!

934
01:04:07,002 --> 01:04:10,102
We are ashamed!

935
01:04:21,603 --> 01:04:23,603
There you are, Dot.
You win.

936
01:04:23,804 --> 01:04:25,604
But stay awhile, don't rush off.

937
01:04:25,635 --> 01:04:29,305
I'd love to, Charlie. But I've got to be up
first thing in the morning.

938
01:04:29,346 --> 01:04:31,606
Yes? What's the big idea?

939
01:04:31,637 --> 01:04:34,407
I'm going to grab the first
train for St. Louis.

940
01:04:36,408 --> 01:04:38,408
I'll get your wraps for you.

941
01:05:07,909 --> 01:05:09,609
- Good night, Charlie.
- Good night, Dot.

942
01:05:09,999 --> 01:05:11,710
- Good night.
- Good night.

943
01:05:34,011 --> 01:05:35,580
Why, Dick!

944
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,581
I thought you'd gone to St. Louis.

945
01:05:51,282 --> 01:05:52,800
Where have you been?

946
01:05:52,801 --> 01:05:56,101
- You know, Rose and Bob Clayton.
- Yeah?

947
01:05:56,122 --> 01:05:59,400
- At the party, remember?
- Must have been some party.

948
01:05:59,431 --> 01:06:01,900
Oh, it was. It was an awful brawl.

949
01:06:01,921 --> 01:06:05,100
- Lots to drink?
- Barrels. Why?

950
01:06:05,202 --> 01:06:07,080
Because those parties usually
don't break up...

951
01:06:07,099 --> 01:06:09,431
...until they've cleaned out the last
bottle of booze.

952
01:06:09,452 --> 01:06:10,700
And it's pretty late.

953
01:06:10,701 --> 01:06:12,770
Yes, I know, but you see, uh...

954
01:06:12,791 --> 01:06:16,771
Oh, Rose passed out, and Bob asked
me to take care of her.

955
01:06:16,792 --> 01:06:19,200
- Anything serious?
- Oh, no!

956
01:06:19,231 --> 01:06:21,700
Just a bad head.
Oh, but she's alright now.

957
01:06:21,901 --> 01:06:23,301
That's good.

958
01:06:34,502 --> 01:06:36,502
Oh, Dick.

959
01:06:46,303 --> 01:06:49,503
- Dick, let me explain?
- You don't have to!

960
01:06:49,531 --> 01:06:51,904
You were with Bates,
and I can guess the rest.

961
01:06:51,935 --> 01:06:55,205
- But, Dick, I want to tell you the truth.
- Don't bother!

962
01:06:55,606 --> 01:06:57,500
Don't you love me anymore?

963
01:06:58,201 --> 01:07:00,300
Why don't you ask yourself
the same question?

964
01:07:00,321 --> 01:07:02,501
- But you know I do.
- I don't know anything of the kind.

965
01:07:02,522 --> 01:07:05,282
- But I just told you.
- Yeah, you told me a lot of things,

966
01:07:05,299 --> 01:07:06,500
but I don't believe you.

967
01:07:06,501 --> 01:07:09,961
- Oh, Dick.
- Expect me to believe a liar and a cheat?

968
01:07:09,982 --> 01:07:12,562
- You dare say that to me?
- Well, that's what you are.

969
01:07:12,563 --> 01:07:13,880
You didn't give me the chance
to tell you.

970
01:07:13,899 --> 01:07:15,480
You've had your chance,
you told me enough.

971
01:07:15,499 --> 01:07:17,600
- I can account for everything!
- Oh, I don't doubt that.

972
01:07:17,621 --> 01:07:19,661
All your friends weren't drunk
and put in jail.

973
01:07:19,682 --> 01:07:22,360
Oh, I know all about you and
Charlie Bates.

974
01:07:22,381 --> 01:07:24,180
That's just it, you don't know
a thing about it.

975
01:07:24,199 --> 01:07:25,300
Well, I can guess.

976
01:07:25,321 --> 01:07:28,400
I'm well acquainted with the rotten habits
of that crowd you trot around with.

977
01:07:28,421 --> 01:07:31,431
The rotten crowd, eh? Well, I notice you
don't mind trotting around with them.

978
01:07:31,452 --> 01:07:33,880
Oh, don't I? Well, I only did it
to please you.

979
01:07:33,899 --> 01:07:36,181
Hm, you accept their friendship
and hospitality,

980
01:07:36,182 --> 01:07:37,370
then you turn around and call them...

981
01:07:37,391 --> 01:07:39,700
A rotten bunch of pasty-faced,
loose-lipped wasters.

982
01:07:39,721 --> 01:07:40,901
Parasites!

983
01:07:42,002 --> 01:07:44,302
Parasites?
Well, that's good!

984
01:07:46,203 --> 01:07:48,303
That sounds fine coming from you.

985
01:07:48,304 --> 01:07:51,400
Why, you're in the same class as
Llewellyn Post, only you won't admit it.

986
01:07:51,421 --> 01:07:54,201
Oh, I'll admit it.
I'm nothing but a kept husband.

987
01:07:54,222 --> 01:07:57,100
Since you put it that way,
that's just what you are.

988
01:07:57,171 --> 01:07:59,700
- That's just what I was.
- Was?

989
01:07:59,791 --> 01:08:01,700
- What are you going to do?
- Quit.

990
01:08:01,721 --> 01:08:03,501
I'm through with you and I'm
through with all this.

991
01:08:03,502 --> 01:08:05,952
Through chiselling your father out of
all that money I don't earn...

992
01:08:05,973 --> 01:08:07,453
...just to be your lap dog.

993
01:08:07,474 --> 01:08:10,180
Oh, is that so?
Well, you can keep all that stuff.

994
01:08:10,199 --> 01:08:11,900
There's only one thing I'll keep.

995
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,201
- That's my self-respect.
- All right!

996
01:08:14,702 --> 01:08:18,202
I won't give you back this engagement ring
because I paid for it myself.

997
01:08:19,003 --> 01:08:20,703
But you can give this back
to your mother.

998
01:08:20,754 --> 01:08:21,900
Here.

999
01:08:26,701 --> 01:08:28,201
Goodbye, Mr. Brunton.

1000
01:08:28,202 --> 01:08:30,502
My lawyers will call you up
in a few days.

1001
01:08:30,533 --> 01:08:32,903
Don't hold me up for too
much alimony.

1002
01:08:42,504 --> 01:08:45,600
You don't look so snappy this
morning, Mrs. Brunton.

1003
01:08:47,201 --> 01:08:51,000
I didn't sleep a wink all night,
worried about Dick.

1004
01:08:51,122 --> 01:08:54,302
Oh, he's all right.
He takes after you.

1005
01:08:54,703 --> 01:08:57,503
Great oaks from little acorns grow.

1006
01:08:58,804 --> 01:09:00,800
I know everything's alright, but...

1007
01:09:01,101 --> 01:09:02,501
Still I...

1008
01:09:04,402 --> 01:09:08,502
Say, you ain't going to raise my room rent
just because I'm a boss puddler, are you?

1009
01:09:08,553 --> 01:09:10,403
No, Hughie.

1010
01:09:10,604 --> 01:09:13,504
- You'd better hurry.
- I never hurry.

1011
01:09:13,505 --> 01:09:16,005
I claim haste makes waste.

1012
01:09:18,006 --> 01:09:19,206
Holy Moses.

1013
01:09:28,107 --> 01:09:29,999
- Good morning, Mr. Parker.
- Morning.

1014
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,280
Is Mrs. Brunton downstairs?
- No, sir.

1015
01:09:32,299 --> 01:09:34,000
She hasn't come down yet today.

1016
01:09:37,801 --> 01:09:40,201
- Is my daughter in?
- Yes, sir, but you can't see her.

1017
01:09:40,222 --> 01:09:42,400
- Why can't I?
- She's been ill.

1018
01:09:42,401 --> 01:09:45,701
- She hasn't slept.
- Well, that's just too bad.

1019
01:10:10,502 --> 01:10:12,402
Here, read that.

1020
01:10:29,203 --> 01:10:31,303
Oh, Dad, I'm terribly sorry.

1021
01:10:31,334 --> 01:10:32,954
You ought to be.
Though little good it'll do you.

1022
01:10:32,975 --> 01:10:33,975
What do you mean?

1023
01:10:33,976 --> 01:10:37,176
You almost ruined the biggest deal
the Parker Steel Corporation ever had.

1024
01:10:37,197 --> 01:10:39,947
Yes, and you ruined one of the
finest boys I ever saw.

1025
01:10:39,968 --> 01:10:41,480
- I did not.
- I tell you you did.

1026
01:10:41,481 --> 01:10:44,730
You rotted his soul, you killed
his manhood and ambition.

1027
01:10:44,771 --> 01:10:48,331
Why, when he walked into the office with
this I thought I was looking at a ghost.

1028
01:10:48,332 --> 01:10:50,250
- Why, what has he...
- I don't know what he's done,

1029
01:10:50,271 --> 01:10:52,331
...and I hate to think what
he might do.

1030
01:10:52,352 --> 01:10:55,032
I tried to pep him up and make
him take that St. Louis job.

1031
01:10:55,053 --> 01:10:57,680
- But I'm afraid.
- Oh, I'm afraid too.

1032
01:10:57,699 --> 01:11:01,381
You had an infernal nerve letting your
pink teas interfere with that boy's career?

1033
01:11:01,399 --> 01:11:03,882
What right have you to say that
to me when it's all your fault?

1034
01:11:03,899 --> 01:11:05,383
- My fault?
- Yes!

1035
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:08,000
Oh, it's no use arguing with you.
You men always stick together.

1036
01:11:08,021 --> 01:11:10,700
Well you can get rid of this house.
I never want to live in it again.

1037
01:11:10,721 --> 01:11:12,401
You'd better get rid of some
of your foolishness...

1038
01:11:12,422 --> 01:11:14,900
...and you've got to find that boy
and find him quick.

1039
01:11:14,921 --> 01:11:16,800
And what's more, you're going
back to him.

1040
01:11:16,821 --> 01:11:18,800
I won't go back!
I won't go back!

1041
01:11:18,801 --> 01:11:22,101
I won't, I won't, I won't,
I won't, I won't go back!

1042
01:11:24,502 --> 01:11:28,302
Well... he said goodbye.

1043
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:33,803
But he said he couldn't go to St. Louis and
put that deal over the way he was feeling.

1044
01:11:37,004 --> 01:11:40,304
Mother, I'd give anything to see him
just for a minute.

1045
01:11:42,305 --> 01:11:45,605
I'm afraid, dear, from what
you've told me...

1046
01:11:46,706 --> 01:11:48,306
...it's too late.

1047
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,600
There, there, there now, dear.
I didn't mean that.

1048
01:12:02,201 --> 01:12:05,101
No, it's just that you said...

1049
01:12:05,132 --> 01:12:06,702
...it's too late.

1050
01:12:06,703 --> 01:12:10,603
- Oh, Mother, I've been just rotten.
- No you haven't, dear.

1051
01:12:10,634 --> 01:12:12,804
You've just been human.

1052
01:12:13,805 --> 01:12:17,505
But why did I say...
Oh, why didn't I cut my tongue off?

1053
01:12:17,506 --> 01:12:20,680
Oh, well, you didn't mean it.
Dick should have known you didn't mean it.

1054
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:23,901
Oh, can you blame him?
Who'd stand for being called a...

1055
01:12:23,922 --> 01:12:25,102
Listen, Dorothy.

1056
01:12:25,999 --> 01:12:28,103
All husbands are kept.

1057
01:12:28,804 --> 01:12:30,900
Some of them are kept with money.

1058
01:12:30,931 --> 01:12:36,001
But most of them with love, devotion,
and sacrifice.

1059
01:12:36,022 --> 01:12:38,802
Why, it's every woman's mission in life.

1060
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:40,400
Keeping her husband.

1061
01:12:41,701 --> 01:12:42,999
Mother.

1062
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,880
- Couldn't you find him, Mr. Hanready?
- No, didn't he phone in?

1063
01:12:54,899 --> 01:12:55,999
No.

1064
01:12:56,030 --> 01:12:58,900
What can't be cured must be endured.

1065
01:13:01,301 --> 01:13:04,600
- Any luck, Hanready?
- No, couldn't find him anywhere.

1066
01:13:04,601 --> 01:13:08,200
- Been in every speakeasy in town.
- By George.

1067
01:13:08,451 --> 01:13:09,600
I wonder...

1068
01:13:09,801 --> 01:13:11,600
Say, I think I know where
I can find him.

1069
01:13:11,601 --> 01:13:13,931
Call my chauffeur and tell him
to bring my car at once.

1070
01:13:13,952 --> 01:13:15,132
Yes, sir.

1071
01:13:28,133 --> 01:13:31,233
Connecticut wrapper with
ACID fedity filler.

1072
01:13:34,634 --> 01:13:37,334
Beggars can't be chosers.

1073
01:13:52,135 --> 01:13:55,065
My boy, I'm glad you didn't
change your mind.

1074
01:13:55,086 --> 01:13:56,976
- Mr. Parker.
- I knew you wouldn't fail me.

1075
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:58,047
All aboard!

1076
01:13:58,068 --> 01:13:59,900
Don't you worry a minute.
I'll put this deal over.

1077
01:13:59,921 --> 01:14:01,780
But that resignation goes
the minute I get it over.

1078
01:14:01,799 --> 01:14:03,481
We'll talk about that when
you get back.

1079
01:14:06,182 --> 01:14:07,782
- Goodbye.
- Good luck.

1080
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:23,583
And boy, bring in a table.

1081
01:14:23,599 --> 01:14:25,484
Yes, sir. Coming right up, boss.

1082
01:14:33,885 --> 01:14:35,285
Oh, Dick!

1083
01:14:36,586 --> 01:14:37,800
What are you doing here?

1084
01:14:37,801 --> 01:14:39,501
Aren't you glad to see me?

1085
01:14:39,522 --> 01:14:41,350
I can't say that, I'm no liar.

1086
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:45,400
Oh, I don't blame you. I did lie to you.
But I'm no cheat.

1087
01:14:45,401 --> 01:14:48,101
I couldn't let you go away
without explaining it to you.

1088
01:14:48,302 --> 01:14:51,100
Oh, Dick, you must believe me.

1089
01:14:52,201 --> 01:14:54,101
Oh, I do believe you.

1090
01:14:54,102 --> 01:14:56,302
Oh, thanks.
Oh, listen, Dick.

1091
01:14:56,333 --> 01:14:59,000
- I'm going to get rid of the house.
- That's not enough.

1092
01:14:59,021 --> 01:15:01,601
We're not going to be kept by
your father's money any longer.

1093
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:03,000
Oh, no, never.

1094
01:15:03,021 --> 01:15:05,401
Dick, we're going to live on your salary.

1095
01:15:05,702 --> 01:15:08,202
But wait a minute.
Will you do me a favor?

1096
01:15:08,223 --> 01:15:10,600
- What is it?
- Let's start all over again.

1097
01:15:11,201 --> 01:15:13,101
You propose to me.

1098
01:15:14,302 --> 01:15:16,202
Will you be my wife, Dot?

1099
01:15:16,203 --> 01:15:21,000
Yes. But this time I'm going to keep
you in a different way.

1100
01:15:32,001 --> 01:15:42,001
