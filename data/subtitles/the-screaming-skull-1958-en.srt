00:00:51,076 --> 00:00:53,236
The Screaming Skull
<i>is a motion picture

2
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,753
<i>that reaches its climax
in shocking horror.

3
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:58,747
<i>Its impact is so terrifying

4
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,499
<i>that it may have
an unforeseen effect:

5
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:04,091
<i>it may kill you.

6
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:08,126
<i>Therefore,
its producers feel

7
00:01:08,343 --> 00:01:10,093
<i>they must assure
free burial services

8
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,313
<i>to anyone
who dies of fright

9
00:01:12,514 --> 00:01:15,484
<i>while seeing</i>
The Screaming Skull.

10
00:03:36,866 --> 00:03:38,526
Welcome, Mrs. Whitlock.

11
00:03:38,743 --> 00:03:40,293
It's lovely, Eric.

12
00:03:40,495 --> 00:03:42,245
You looked disappointed
for a moment.

13
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,865
I did not.
It's really lovely.

14
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,673
Oh, look.

15
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,310
I bet that's the den there.

16
00:04:01,516 --> 00:04:02,636
That's right.

17
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:04,021
Is that a bedroom?

18
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:08,364
- Yes, it is.
- It's gonna be ours?

19
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:10,895
It'll need some fixing first.

20
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:12,779
It was her room, wasn't it?

21
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:13,986
Yes.

22
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:16,284
Come on along. I'll show you
the rest of the house.

23
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:42,059
It's rather forbidding
now, I suppose,

24
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:44,015
<i>empty like this.

25
00:04:44,225 --> 00:04:46,385
<i>But it was usually this way.

26
00:04:46,603 --> 00:04:48,313
<i>Shortly after Marion
and I were married,

27
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,771
<i>she removed all of the furniture
her parents had left her.

28
00:04:51,983 --> 00:04:54,653
<i>"This is our home,"
she used to say,

29
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,861
<i>"and we must choose
everything carefully."

30
00:04:58,072 --> 00:05:00,662
<i>Well, we didn't get very far
before she died.

31
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:05,367
But now that you are here,
it's gonna be lovely again.

32
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,122
I'll get the things
out of storage tomorrow.

33
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,093
They're all in town
at the warehouse.

34
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,380
And I'll take care
of that, too.

35
00:05:18,593 --> 00:05:20,263
You have candles?

36
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,970
Sure.

37
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,720
It'll be twice as romantic.

38
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:27,273
Speaking of being romantic...

39
00:05:31,356 --> 00:05:34,026
I forgot to carry you
over the threshold.

40
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:38,525
I love you.

41
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:43,493
- I love you.
- Oh, Jenni.

42
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:46,581
I thought life
had died out for me.

43
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:04,682
What's that up there?

44
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:07,639
Oh, that's where Mickey
keeps his gardening things.

45
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,350
- Who's Mickey?
- The gardener.

46
00:06:10,561 --> 00:06:13,111
He's kept it up for
two years I've been away.

47
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:15,904
- By himself?
- That's right.

48
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,989
He must work awfully hard.

49
00:06:18,194 --> 00:06:20,494
Oh, he and Marion
would spend hours on end

50
00:06:20,697 --> 00:06:21,817
working here in the gardens,

51
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,408
and up in the greenhouse
back there.

52
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:26,987
See, he loved it very much.

53
00:06:27,203 --> 00:06:28,793
Sometimes, I used to wonder
who she was,

54
00:06:28,997 --> 00:06:31,997
my wife or Mickey's
nursemaid.

55
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:35,128
You know, I don't think
he quite believes she's gone.

56
00:06:35,336 --> 00:06:36,666
I think he expects her
to show up

57
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,509
one of these mornings
and scold her

58
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:40,925
for neglecting the gardens.

59
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,394
You still love her,
don't you?

60
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:50,559
No, I'm not jealous.

61
00:06:50,768 --> 00:06:52,768
I'm grateful to her.

62
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,769
I think to have loved once,

63
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,441
really loved,

64
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,189
is to learn
how to love always.

65
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:02,741
Learning it from her,
you give again to me.

66
00:07:03,948 --> 00:07:06,158
I wish there was some way
to thank her.

67
00:07:11,956 --> 00:07:14,706
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

68
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:18,047
And they're driving
around the back.

69
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:21,087
Come on, come on along.

70
00:07:24,052 --> 00:07:25,892
- Eric.
- I see Eric. Hi.

71
00:07:26,095 --> 00:07:28,715
We stopped by
to meet your new wife.

72
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:31,521
Oh, Eric, this is
a wonderful surprise.

73
00:07:31,726 --> 00:07:33,476
- It's been a long time.
- It has.

74
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,436
- Reverend.
- Good to see you, Eric.

75
00:07:35,646 --> 00:07:37,606
Jenni, this is Mrs. Snow.

76
00:07:37,815 --> 00:07:39,315
I'm very happy to meet you.

77
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,105
Jenni, this is
a lovely surprise.

78
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,070
And the reverend, Mr. Snow.

79
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,280
Hello, my dear.

80
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:47,738
- Oh, she's sweet, Eric.
- I know.

81
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,410
I happened to be going into town,
I ran into Mr. Mauer.

82
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,140
He told me you were
getting back today.

83
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,495
And we thought
we'd just drop by

84
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,176
and bring you something
for your dinner.

85
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,808
- How nice of you.
- Well, it'll save you

86
00:07:56,918 --> 00:07:59,358
all the bother of shopping while
you're trying to get settled.

87
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:01,342
Then, why don't you stay
for dinner?

88
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,167
- Oh, no, not tonight.
- Oh, no, no.

89
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:04,423
We wouldn't think of that.

90
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,010
- Oh, now, please say yes.
- We'd like for you to.

91
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,140
- It would be like old times.
- All right.

92
00:08:09,347 --> 00:08:11,597
On the condition
that I do the cooking.

93
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:13,018
You don't have to.

94
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,136
You know, I know that,
but I'd love to.

95
00:08:17,188 --> 00:08:18,768
Well, there's Mickey.

96
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:20,071
Excuse me, honey.

97
00:08:20,274 --> 00:08:21,734
Mickey!

98
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:29,532
Oh, poor Mickey.

99
00:08:30,952 --> 00:08:33,332
He keeps this place up
like a shrine.

100
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:37,915
Eric told me
how he loved Marion.

101
00:08:38,126 --> 00:08:39,626
Mickey's father
was a gardener here

102
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:42,256
when Marion's mother
was alive.

103
00:08:42,463 --> 00:08:45,423
Mickey and Marion
grew up together here.

104
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:48,553
Jenni, this is Mickey.

105
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:51,219
How do you do, Mickey?

106
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,981
I hope we'll be good friends.

107
00:08:54,725 --> 00:08:56,685
Well, Mickey?

108
00:09:01,315 --> 00:09:03,475
Thank you, Mickey.

109
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:06,323
- Well, shall we all go inside?
- It's a good idea.

110
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:07,709
Mickey, remember,
you promised me

111
00:09:07,738 --> 00:09:09,318
some of those rose cuttings.

112
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:11,082
Nice seeing you again,
Mickey.

113
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,414
I'm going to have to get you

114
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:13,798
down to the barbershop
one day very soon.

115
00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:15,748
Excuse us, Mickey.

116
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,327
All right, that's done.

117
00:09:56,537 --> 00:09:58,707
Oh, god. Please, be careful!

118
00:09:58,915 --> 00:10:00,955
Oh, Edward, now,
don't break your neck.

119
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,307
You're doing great,
reverend.

120
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,745
- Don't worry.
- Good heavens.

121
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:06,051
Honestly, the two of them
are just like children.

122
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:07,835
That doesn't look
too bad, Eric.

123
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:11,219
Jenni, I hope you have more luck
in getting your husband to mind

124
00:10:11,427 --> 00:10:12,757
than I've had with mine.

125
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,300
You know,
you've got to admit,

126
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:16,064
it does make the room
look better.

127
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:17,465
It went very well, Tarzan.

128
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,853
For penance, you can come
help me with dinner.

129
00:10:20,061 --> 00:10:21,061
Now, come on.

130
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:22,469
Edward, you keep
Jenni company?

131
00:10:22,563 --> 00:10:24,063
Yes, dear.

132
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,870
No, Marion, no...

133
00:10:43,084 --> 00:10:45,174
Send them away!

134
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,665
No.

135
00:10:52,843 --> 00:10:55,263
Oh, she's so very nice, Eric.

136
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:56,471
- Jenni?
- Yes.

137
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,759
- Isn't she wonderful?
- Yes.

138
00:10:57,807 --> 00:11:00,977
She's not at all like Marion,
and I think that's for the best.

139
00:11:01,185 --> 00:11:03,395
You know, so many men,
when they lose a wife,

140
00:11:03,604 --> 00:11:05,114
they try so hard
to deny the loss,

141
00:11:05,314 --> 00:11:07,524
they marry someone
exactly like the first wife.

142
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,693
It hardly seems fair
using the living

143
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,612
to bring back the dead,
does it?

144
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:13,161
No, I suppose, it doesn't.

145
00:11:13,364 --> 00:11:15,374
We make a prison
for ourselves out of the past,

146
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,535
at least, our sentimental
wished-for past.

147
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:21,334
- Mrs. Snow.
- Yes, dear.

148
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:23,539
There's something I must
tell you and the reverend.

149
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,253
Well, of course, Eric.
What is it?

150
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,420
You see, Jenni has not had
a very happy past.

151
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:30,089
- Oh?
- And talking about it,

152
00:11:30,298 --> 00:11:33,588
or about something that might
strongly remind her of it,

153
00:11:33,801 --> 00:11:35,591
she's very impressionable.

154
00:11:35,803 --> 00:11:37,103
Is there something
wrong, Eric?

155
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:38,505
No, not really.

156
00:11:38,723 --> 00:11:40,313
You see,

157
00:11:40,516 --> 00:11:43,096
she lost her parents
many years ago

158
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:45,401
in a very tragic way,

159
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:48,815
and talking about
unhappy past only...

160
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:50,525
She's very impressionable.

161
00:11:50,735 --> 00:11:52,565
See, I want her
to be happy, Mrs. Snow.

162
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:55,318
Of course you do,
and so do we all.

163
00:11:55,531 --> 00:11:57,991
Now, how did she lose them?

164
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:00,623
Well, I'm not prying, dear.

165
00:12:00,828 --> 00:12:02,588
It's just that Mr. Snow
and i can help better

166
00:12:02,747 --> 00:12:04,037
if we know something
about it.

167
00:12:04,248 --> 00:12:07,958
They drowned in an accident.

168
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:09,669
Jenni saw it all.

169
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,921
Who's Mr. Mauer?

170
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:17,093
Mr. Mauer? Well,
he's a lawyer in town.

171
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,743
I thought no one knew
we were coming.

172
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:20,508
You said you heard
from Mr. Mauer?

173
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:22,143
Well, Eric wrote him.

174
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,940
He takes care of the estate
or what's left of it.

175
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,984
Oh, that's right.
Eric has to see him tomorrow.

176
00:12:28,189 --> 00:12:29,729
Well, Eric's co-executor
of the estate,

177
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,320
along with Mr. Mauer.

178
00:12:31,525 --> 00:12:33,045
You see, Marion's death
was so sudden

179
00:12:33,235 --> 00:12:34,775
that, well, all that
was left to Eric

180
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:37,697
was the house and these grounds.

181
00:12:37,907 --> 00:12:39,617
Mr. Mauer told me
that Eric had found

182
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:42,195
someone very sweet
and very kind,

183
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:44,581
and with whom he is
very much in love.

184
00:12:44,789 --> 00:12:47,079
He didn't say enough.

185
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,590
How did Marion die?

186
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:57,219
Didn't Eric tell you?

187
00:12:57,426 --> 00:12:59,716
I think the subject's
rather painful to him.

188
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:02,719
I don't like to make him
talk about it.

189
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,140
Would you mind telling me?
I'd like to know.

190
00:13:08,145 --> 00:13:10,015
It was a rainy day.

191
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,860
She and Mickey had been working
up there in the greenhouse.

192
00:13:14,068 --> 00:13:18,358
She left him to go back
to the house for a few minutes.

193
00:13:20,074 --> 00:13:24,124
The way we pieced it together
after the accident is that...

194
00:13:24,328 --> 00:13:26,958
While she was coming
down this path,

195
00:13:27,164 --> 00:13:30,134
apparently, it began
to rain very hard.

196
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:32,544
She must have run along here.

197
00:13:33,587 --> 00:13:36,967
We don't know, of course,
what happened then.

198
00:13:37,174 --> 00:13:39,844
Perhaps she slipped
on a leaf.

199
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,642
They said her skull
was smashed.

200
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:49,521
It was thought
that she hit her head

201
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:52,649
on the edge of the cement wall
where we're sitting,

202
00:13:52,857 --> 00:13:55,027
and she fell in there.

203
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,784
She died in the water.

204
00:13:56,986 --> 00:13:58,746
That's where Eric found her
10 minutes later.

205
00:14:04,285 --> 00:14:06,655
Marion.

206
00:14:06,871 --> 00:14:08,291
Marion.

207
00:14:09,623 --> 00:14:10,753
Marion...

208
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,878
You said...

209
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:16,125
You said, "Mickey, wait here.

210
00:14:16,338 --> 00:14:20,838
"I'm going down to the house
for just a minute.

211
00:14:21,844 --> 00:14:23,644
"Wait here, Mickey,"
you said,

212
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:27,306
<i>and then you went away
in the rain...

213
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:29,556
<i>And you didn't
come back to play.

214
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,229
Marion!

215
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:35,067
Why didn't you?

217
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,730
And don't forget that you
and Eric are coming for lunch

218
00:14:38,903 --> 00:14:39,953
the day after tomorrow.

219
00:14:40,154 --> 00:14:41,194
We'll do better than that.

220
00:14:41,363 --> 00:14:42,923
We'll come to church
on Sunday, as well.

221
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:46,615
Oh, getting Eric to church
is like moving a mountain.

222
00:14:46,827 --> 00:14:47,827
He'll come.

223
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,873
Come along, my dear,
it's getting late.

224
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,043
Eric, thank you very much

225
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,090
for bringing Jenni
into our lives.

226
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,754
Thank you for the dinner.

227
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,802
It's a pleasure. Thank you.

228
00:14:59,006 --> 00:15:00,966
- Good night.
- Good night.

229
00:15:02,718 --> 00:15:05,138
Edward, did you know
that Jenni's very wealthy?

230
00:15:05,346 --> 00:15:07,386
Well, yes, Mr. Mauer
told me in town today.

231
00:15:07,598 --> 00:15:08,948
But she's not at all
like Marion.

232
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,564
You know, she's so gentle
and timid as if...

233
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:14,349
As if she were afraid
of something.

234
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:20,151
I knew you'd like
my friends, dear.

235
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:23,361
Hey, what's this, huh?

236
00:15:23,572 --> 00:15:25,662
Just happy, that's all.

237
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:27,326
- Oh, come here.
- I'm so happy.

238
00:15:27,535 --> 00:15:28,575
Come on.

239
00:15:54,144 --> 00:15:55,944
How are the cots?

240
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:58,899
Fine.

241
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,027
What are you reading?

242
00:16:05,155 --> 00:16:07,905
Something Mrs. Snow
sent over.

243
00:16:08,492 --> 00:16:09,842
Interesting?

244
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:13,964
It's called
<i>Beast in the Jungle.

245
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,964
It's all about a man
who waited all of his life

246
00:16:22,172 --> 00:16:23,512
for something great,

247
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,426
wonderful to happen to him.

248
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:29,845
He had only one good friend,

249
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:34,141
it's a woman
in whom he confided.

250
00:16:35,185 --> 00:16:37,845
And she died.

251
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,864
At her grave,
he suddenly realized

252
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,547
that she was the great
wonderful thing

253
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,986
that he'd waited for
all of his life.

254
00:16:47,823 --> 00:16:50,373
But it's too late then.

255
00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:54,496
And his memory is like...

256
00:16:54,705 --> 00:16:57,075
Beast in the jungle...

257
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,131
Rise up out of the past...

258
00:17:00,336 --> 00:17:01,336
Overwhelming.

259
00:17:01,545 --> 00:17:03,505
Oh...

260
00:17:03,714 --> 00:17:06,094
Poor fellow.

261
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:09,509
He doesn't know what
he missed.

262
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:48,801
Eric?

263
00:18:15,285 --> 00:18:16,735
Eric?

264
00:18:33,595 --> 00:18:35,255
Eric?

265
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:11,883
Jenni!

266
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:14,552
What are you doing here?

267
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:21,523
The window was blowing.
Where were you?

268
00:19:21,935 --> 00:19:24,765
I thought I heard
someone moving about.

269
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,520
Now, what is it?

270
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,445
What is that?

271
00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:34,609
Is that water?

272
00:19:36,116 --> 00:19:38,536
A lily pad?

273
00:19:47,878 --> 00:19:51,048
I don't think Mickey
looks for her in the pond.

274
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,966
Jenni, now, stop it.

275
00:19:54,176 --> 00:19:57,636
I can't help it, Eric,
that bad feelings come back.

276
00:19:57,846 --> 00:19:59,716
I forbid you
to talk about it.

277
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,892
She looked like that, Eric.

278
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,271
My mother looked like that!

279
00:20:03,477 --> 00:20:05,227
Oh, Jenni, Jenni.

280
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:08,187
I can't help it, Eric.

281
00:20:08,398 --> 00:20:09,838
Darling, you're just
talking yourself

282
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,322
into those same old fears.

283
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:12,807
I've got to talk
about it, Eric.

284
00:20:12,903 --> 00:20:13,573
I have to talk about it!

285
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,409
I forbid you
to talk about it now.

286
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,025
What?

287
00:20:18,242 --> 00:20:20,042
Just that with you beside me,
I'm alive again.

288
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,699
I don't wanna be
sick anymore.

289
00:20:21,912 --> 00:20:23,582
Honey, look.

290
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,999
Now, you mustn't go on
thinking like this.

291
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:30,589
Besides, how could a very
poorly-done self-portrait

292
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,296
upset you so much?

293
00:20:40,097 --> 00:20:42,677
I know it's only
my own fear.

294
00:20:42,891 --> 00:20:45,891
It's my own guilt
that I can't get away from.

295
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:49,107
Eric, I'm sorry.

296
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:56,911
I want you to listen to me,
and I want you to believe me.

297
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:06,827
Now, you were sick once, yes,
but you were cured.

298
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,171
Mickey caused this.

299
00:21:09,376 --> 00:21:11,126
You may as well know.

300
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,016
He does look for Marion
night after night

301
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,670
down by that pond.

302
00:21:14,882 --> 00:21:16,972
And he probably
comes here afterwards.

303
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:20,756
I'm gonna speak to Mickey
in the morning.

304
00:21:20,971 --> 00:21:22,931
Now, don't you see

305
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,980
how simply it's all
explained away?

306
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:28,475
But if I also heard
a scream, Eric?

307
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,227
Before I went
to the hospital,

308
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:32,069
I was hearing things.

309
00:21:32,274 --> 00:21:33,274
I'm hearing them again.

310
00:21:33,442 --> 00:21:35,572
What did you hear?

311
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:37,947
It was a high,
strange scream.

312
00:21:38,155 --> 00:21:40,405
High, strange scream?

313
00:21:40,616 --> 00:21:41,616
Like a peacock's cry?

314
00:21:41,825 --> 00:21:43,905
What's that sound like?

315
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,449
Come here.

316
00:22:01,637 --> 00:22:03,807
Sound like that?

317
00:22:04,014 --> 00:22:05,014
You see?

318
00:22:05,182 --> 00:22:08,062
It's all very, very real.

319
00:22:08,268 --> 00:22:10,438
I'm such a fool.

320
00:22:10,646 --> 00:22:12,226
You feeling better now?

321
00:22:12,439 --> 00:22:13,439
Yes.

323
00:22:38,298 --> 00:22:39,668
Good night.

324
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:47,769
Ah, we won't be bothered
with any of Mickey's

325
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:49,515
nightly visits anymore.

326
00:22:49,726 --> 00:22:51,556
I've forbidden him
to come into the house.

327
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,980
I was just nervous
last night.

328
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:54,828
I wish you wouldn't
take it out on Mickey.

329
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,150
No, he's a child.

330
00:22:56,358 --> 00:22:57,778
He must be disciplined.

331
00:22:57,985 --> 00:23:00,395
I'd like him to feel
I'm his friend.

332
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,132
Why don't you do
some gardening with him

333
00:23:02,155 --> 00:23:03,235
while I'm in town?

334
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:04,608
If he sees you're
interested,

335
00:23:04,658 --> 00:23:06,408
you'll win him over
quickly enough.

336
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:07,868
Wait a minute.

337
00:23:14,668 --> 00:23:16,668
I made a list, staples mostly.

338
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:19,298
Are you sure you don't
wanna come in with me?

339
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,592
You'll get more done
without me.

340
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:27,888
I got to see about the lights,
the phone, the bank,

341
00:23:28,098 --> 00:23:29,778
and the warehouse people
about that furniture,

342
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,848
you know, that couch
has just about broken my back.

343
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,480
Don't forget
to see Mr. Mauer.

344
00:23:33,687 --> 00:23:34,747
I have to see him
this evening.

345
00:23:34,771 --> 00:23:36,611
It's a bore, but I'll
have to see him.

346
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,975
Will you be home in time
for dinner? I'll wait for you.

347
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:40,817
Now, if I'm not,
don't you worry, darling.

348
00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:42,168
Getting out of
Mauer's clutches

349
00:23:42,195 --> 00:23:44,735
sometimes requires
an active guard.

350
00:23:44,948 --> 00:23:46,198
I love you.

351
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:09,473
Hello, Mickey.

352
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:18,692
Oh, look out.

353
00:24:18,899 --> 00:24:21,109
You almost cut him.

354
00:24:21,318 --> 00:24:23,188
He's a handsome one,
isn't he?

355
00:24:23,403 --> 00:24:25,533
So cuddly and warm.

356
00:24:25,739 --> 00:24:29,619
When I was a little girl, I used
to wanna be a caterpillar.

357
00:24:31,328 --> 00:24:33,118
So, I was a very
little girl!

358
00:24:34,164 --> 00:24:35,674
There you go.

359
00:24:38,293 --> 00:24:41,213
Marion must've loved
the gardens.

360
00:24:42,005 --> 00:24:44,625
We'll keep them lovely
for her always.

361
00:24:44,841 --> 00:24:47,301
You know what I'd like
to do, Mickey?

362
00:24:47,511 --> 00:24:49,191
I'd like to pick some
of the nicest flowers

363
00:24:49,262 --> 00:24:51,682
and take them to her.

364
00:24:52,182 --> 00:24:54,392
Would you like that?

365
00:24:55,685 --> 00:24:58,015
Yes.

366
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,900
Eric told me
she was near here.

367
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,357
Could you show me where?

368
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,190
Is that all right, Mickey?

369
00:25:45,986 --> 00:25:48,486
I'm sure it was a great loss
to all of you, Mickey.

370
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,906
She cries.

371
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,619
Cries?

372
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,790
- In the night.
- Dead people don't cry, Mickey.

373
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,420
I heard her.

374
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,383
Heard her?

375
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,061
Mickey?

376
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,234
<i>I don't think he quite
expects she's gone.

377
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,517
<i>She cries.

378
00:28:27,731 --> 00:28:29,691
<i>She cries in the night.

379
00:28:31,526 --> 00:28:33,106
<i>I think he expects her
to show up

380
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,070
<i>one of these mornings.

381
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,950
<i>She died in the water.

382
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:40,579
<i>The base of her skull
was smashed.

383
00:28:41,995 --> 00:28:43,535
<i>She didn't wanna die.

384
00:28:43,747 --> 00:28:45,167
<i>She died in the water.

385
00:35:53,009 --> 00:35:54,469
Eric?

386
00:36:43,142 --> 00:36:44,182
Jenni?

387
00:36:44,393 --> 00:36:45,393
Jenni?

388
00:36:45,561 --> 00:36:46,771
Jenni? Honey?

389
00:36:46,979 --> 00:36:48,269
Honey?

390
00:36:48,481 --> 00:36:49,761
- Eric!
- It's all right, darling.

391
00:36:49,857 --> 00:36:51,397
It's all right,
I'm right here.

392
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:52,939
I'm right here.

393
00:36:53,152 --> 00:36:56,242
Just lie back, that's
right, just lie back.

394
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:57,527
It's all right.

395
00:37:00,701 --> 00:37:04,001
When you found me,
what else was there?

396
00:37:04,205 --> 00:37:06,785
What do you mean what else?

397
00:37:06,999 --> 00:37:08,669
A skull?

398
00:37:08,876 --> 00:37:10,246
Jenni?

399
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:13,341
I know there was no skull.

400
00:37:13,548 --> 00:37:14,668
Of course not.

401
00:37:18,886 --> 00:37:21,306
Mickey says
Marion cries at night.

402
00:37:21,514 --> 00:37:24,524
Why, that childish,
stupid...

403
00:37:24,725 --> 00:37:25,885
Don't blame him.

404
00:37:26,102 --> 00:37:28,272
We both heard the peacocks.

405
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:29,809
He, out of his love
for Marion,

406
00:37:30,022 --> 00:37:32,772
wishes the cry to be
from her.

407
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,614
I, out of my sickness.

408
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,069
Now, darling.

409
00:37:36,279 --> 00:37:39,529
We've been all through that
nonsense last night.

410
00:37:40,616 --> 00:37:42,406
Don't you see?

411
00:37:44,078 --> 00:37:48,418
I've never imagined
seeing these things before.

412
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:53,208
To just stand there and see it,
if it turned out to be not...

413
00:37:58,176 --> 00:37:59,546
Eric...

414
00:38:02,221 --> 00:38:05,101
I want you to call Dr. Anne
tomorrow in New York.

415
00:38:07,643 --> 00:38:09,063
I want you to take me back.

416
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,110
No, Jenni.

417
00:38:11,314 --> 00:38:13,444
Now, it may sound selfish,

418
00:38:13,649 --> 00:38:15,649
but don't you see,
having you to love,

419
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,400
I'm happy, too.

420
00:38:17,612 --> 00:38:20,242
I don't wanna lose that.

421
00:38:20,448 --> 00:38:22,128
Now, in the morning,
Mr. Snow will be here,

422
00:38:22,325 --> 00:38:23,615
and we'll tell him...

423
00:38:23,826 --> 00:38:25,156
He's very comforting.

424
00:38:28,581 --> 00:38:31,461
And I think
he'll agree with me.

425
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:32,877
About what?

426
00:38:33,085 --> 00:38:35,665
I think it's Mickey.

427
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,880
You see, he hated me
from the first.

428
00:38:39,091 --> 00:38:41,181
Marion was his friend,
and while I married her,

429
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,965
he thought I was taking
her away from him.

430
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,600
And now that she's dead,

431
00:38:45,806 --> 00:38:47,766
taken away from him forever,

432
00:38:47,975 --> 00:38:50,265
I suppose in that
childish mind of his,

433
00:38:50,478 --> 00:38:52,348
I'm responsible for that.

434
00:38:54,607 --> 00:38:58,647
And now, because you're my wife
and in Marion's house,

435
00:38:58,861 --> 00:39:01,861
he hates you, too.

436
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:05,743
I don't think
Mickey is responsible.

437
00:39:05,952 --> 00:39:08,002
He's not quick enough
or clever enough.

438
00:39:08,204 --> 00:39:09,414
Then who?

439
00:39:09,622 --> 00:39:11,792
Myself.

440
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:13,669
It's all in my own mind.

441
00:39:13,876 --> 00:39:16,666
We do need
somebody else, darling.

442
00:39:16,879 --> 00:39:19,459
We need somebody
outside of the confusions

443
00:39:19,674 --> 00:39:22,184
of our love for each other.

444
00:39:22,385 --> 00:39:25,095
Now, the reverend Snow
will be here in the morning.

445
00:39:33,396 --> 00:39:35,056
It was in there.

446
00:39:37,066 --> 00:39:39,356
Well,
this much is real anyway.

447
00:39:39,568 --> 00:39:41,948
Look here, Jenni.

448
00:39:42,154 --> 00:39:44,364
You see, this is how
you gouged your hand.

449
00:39:44,573 --> 00:39:46,213
And you say, you threw
the skull down here

450
00:39:46,325 --> 00:39:47,615
where Eric is looking?

451
00:39:49,036 --> 00:39:50,036
Yeah.

452
00:39:50,246 --> 00:39:51,656
Did you find anything, Eric?

453
00:39:51,872 --> 00:39:53,422
Nothing yet.

454
00:39:55,584 --> 00:39:57,294
Surely, Jenni,
you must agree with me

455
00:39:57,503 --> 00:39:59,883
that anything
as fragile as a skull

456
00:40:00,089 --> 00:40:02,089
would've been smashed
to bits down there.

457
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,090
And Eric has found nothing,

458
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:07,262
and to assume that the skull
would move of its own

459
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:10,431
all the way from there
to the driveway door...

460
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:14,271
Come now, Jenni,
there's no reason for that.

461
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:17,898
Don't you see?
I agree with you.

462
00:40:18,107 --> 00:40:19,647
Did Eric tell you
i spent over a year

463
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:21,569
in the sanitarium?

464
00:40:21,777 --> 00:40:22,817
Well, Eric told Mrs. Snow

465
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:24,529
that you are
very impressionable,

466
00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:26,529
but that's all.

467
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:30,491
I know lots of people needing
a rest go to sanitariums.

468
00:40:30,703 --> 00:40:34,293
This wasn't quite
that kind of sanitarium.

469
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,330
You see...

470
00:40:38,961 --> 00:40:42,461
I grew up loving my father
and hating my mother.

471
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,223
Well, she never knew it.

472
00:40:45,259 --> 00:40:47,799
Something I kept to myself.

473
00:40:48,471 --> 00:40:51,061
She was very beautiful,

474
00:40:51,265 --> 00:40:54,055
very gay, like her.

475
00:40:54,268 --> 00:40:55,808
Very much.

476
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:00,520
And I knew she resented
that I was not more like her.

477
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:04,735
I used to lie awake at night
and wish she were dead.

478
00:41:08,324 --> 00:41:10,534
Well, that isn't
very unusual.

479
00:41:10,743 --> 00:41:13,623
I understand many children
go through such a period.

480
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:16,789
I was no longer a child.

481
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,630
One day...

482
00:41:25,091 --> 00:41:26,341
I got my wish.

483
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:30,101
They were both drowned.

484
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,469
I could still hear
her scream.

485
00:41:35,101 --> 00:41:37,851
I was all alone
on the little beach.

486
00:41:38,687 --> 00:41:40,367
And all I could see
was the overturned boat

487
00:41:40,523 --> 00:41:43,233
on the top of the waves.

488
00:41:43,442 --> 00:41:45,992
And I kept trying
to reach them,

489
00:41:46,195 --> 00:41:48,735
and the waves kept
throwing me back.

490
00:41:51,951 --> 00:41:53,331
And then...

491
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,539
I could hear
her cries no more.

492
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,710
And then, hours later,

493
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:04,589
the men came and searched
for the bodies.

494
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,130
They were never found.

495
00:42:10,136 --> 00:42:12,006
And that's when these
bad feelings started,

496
00:42:12,221 --> 00:42:13,781
this feeling that if
I really wanted to,

497
00:42:13,806 --> 00:42:16,766
I could've saved them,
but I didn't.

498
00:42:17,518 --> 00:42:20,268
That I really killed them.

499
00:42:22,189 --> 00:42:24,359
No, Jenni, you tried.

500
00:42:24,567 --> 00:42:26,067
You tried your very best.

501
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:27,737
I didn't.

502
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:28,985
But thinking, and begging,

503
00:42:29,155 --> 00:42:32,735
and praying couldn't make
this feeling go away.

504
00:42:33,868 --> 00:42:37,198
That's when they took me
to the hospital.

505
00:42:38,497 --> 00:42:40,417
But they told me
I was cured.

506
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:43,004
Jenni.

507
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:45,920
They told me I was cured.

508
00:42:57,099 --> 00:42:58,389
Mickey!

509
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,111
Mickey!

510
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:14,699
All right, you go on.

511
00:43:14,867 --> 00:43:16,327
I'll be there
in time for lunch.

512
00:43:16,535 --> 00:43:18,535
But where do you think
he's gone off to, Eric?

513
00:43:18,746 --> 00:43:20,246
Who knows about Mickey.

514
00:43:20,456 --> 00:43:21,916
He might be hiding.

515
00:43:22,124 --> 00:43:24,634
You looked at
Marion's grave?

516
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,051
Mickey?

517
00:44:10,923 --> 00:44:12,053
Mickey!

518
00:44:15,928 --> 00:44:17,258
Mickey?

519
00:44:18,764 --> 00:44:20,724
Mickey!

520
00:44:20,933 --> 00:44:22,103
Mickey!

521
00:44:26,272 --> 00:44:27,442
Mickey!

522
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:45,458
Eric, did you find him?

523
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:46,876
No.

524
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:47,884
Where's Jenni?

525
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:49,535
She's with Mrs. Snow
on the patio.

526
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:51,133
Eric...

527
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:53,498
I think I should tell you
that Jenni has confided in me

528
00:44:53,632 --> 00:44:54,972
about the sanitarium.

529
00:44:55,175 --> 00:44:58,545
Oh, did your wife know?

530
00:44:59,471 --> 00:45:00,911
I told her Jenni
was impressionable,

531
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:01,931
but not that...

532
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:04,059
Well, I haven't said
a word to her.

533
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:05,268
Mr. Snow,

534
00:45:05,477 --> 00:45:07,517
you can do both Jenni
and me a great favor

535
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:09,820
by forgetting
she ever told you that.

536
00:45:10,024 --> 00:45:11,824
But, Eric,
if it helps explain...

537
00:45:12,026 --> 00:45:13,276
It explains nothing.

538
00:45:13,485 --> 00:45:16,235
If I were you, Eric,
I'd take her away.

539
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:17,527
If she's so impressionable,

540
00:45:17,698 --> 00:45:20,198
and that house
frightens her so much,

541
00:45:20,409 --> 00:45:21,489
why subject her to it?

542
00:45:21,702 --> 00:45:23,202
Look, I can't do a thing
like that.

543
00:45:23,412 --> 00:45:25,122
It'd be the worst
thing for her.

544
00:45:25,331 --> 00:45:28,631
Mr. Snow, it would be
admitting she was sick again.

545
00:45:28,834 --> 00:45:30,794
I want her to be happy.

546
00:45:31,003 --> 00:45:32,303
We'll stay here.

547
00:45:32,504 --> 00:45:34,094
Perhaps you know best, Eric.

548
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:35,878
See, I've got a simple
and old-fashioned

549
00:45:36,091 --> 00:45:37,631
piece of philosophy.

550
00:45:37,843 --> 00:45:40,803
The only cure for her fear
is to teach her she's loved,

551
00:45:41,013 --> 00:45:43,063
I mean, really loved,

552
00:45:43,265 --> 00:45:44,925
and I love her so much.

553
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:47,102
God bless you for that, Eric.

554
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:48,561
She's a very fortunate woman

555
00:45:48,771 --> 00:45:50,441
having someone like you
to care for her.

556
00:45:55,402 --> 00:45:56,822
It'll be night soon.

557
00:45:57,029 --> 00:46:00,199
Oh, Jenni, Jenni...

558
00:46:00,407 --> 00:46:02,237
I'm sorry.

559
00:46:02,451 --> 00:46:05,951
Darling, you've got to believe,
it will not happen again.

560
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:08,373
Ever.

561
00:46:08,582 --> 00:46:10,582
Mickey!

562
00:46:10,793 --> 00:46:11,793
Mickey!

563
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,840
Eric.

564
00:46:14,046 --> 00:46:15,336
Eric!

565
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:30,466
- Eric, stop it!
- All right,

566
00:46:30,604 --> 00:46:32,244
what are you trying to do
with that skull?

567
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:33,706
Eric, stop it,
it wasn't his fault!

568
00:46:33,732 --> 00:46:35,252
- Where did you get it?
- Leave him alone!

569
00:46:35,275 --> 00:46:36,475
I'll take care of this,
Jenni.

570
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:38,150
I know you never
liked me, Mickey.

571
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:40,322
I know you're doing it
to get us to leave here.

572
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:43,081
Idiotic attempt to scare us,
as if we were children.

573
00:46:43,283 --> 00:46:44,993
It was you, wasn't it?

574
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:46,202
Wasn't it?

575
00:46:46,328 --> 00:46:48,408
No, not me, not me.

576
00:46:48,622 --> 00:46:51,502
Ah, get out of here!
Get out of here!

577
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:04,472
I wish you'd apologize to him.

578
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,560
You know as well as I do
it's not his fault.

579
00:47:06,765 --> 00:47:07,765
It's all in my own mind.

580
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:12,391
Jenni, I'm gonna do something,
and you're gonna help me do it.

581
00:47:13,522 --> 00:47:16,732
- What's that?
- That portrait upstairs

582
00:47:17,735 --> 00:47:20,565
reminds you of your mother.

583
00:47:21,155 --> 00:47:23,025
Yeah.

584
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,950
You were fine until
you saw it.

585
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,250
Now it has you all preoccupied
with memories of the past.

586
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:33,169
We're gonna burn it.

587
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,625
That's precious to you, Eric.

588
00:47:34,835 --> 00:47:37,125
The picture means 
nothing to me.

589
00:47:37,337 --> 00:47:39,837
I want you to be happy.

590
00:47:40,048 --> 00:47:43,718
We can't be until this fear
is out of our lives.

591
00:48:04,573 --> 00:48:07,333
All right, Jenni.

592
00:48:07,534 --> 00:48:08,954
Go on, Jenni.

593
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:29,217
Let's go back in now.

594
00:48:36,939 --> 00:48:38,069
It's only the peacocks.

595
00:49:00,128 --> 00:49:02,708
Fire's almost out.

596
00:49:03,757 --> 00:49:05,047
Yes.

597
00:49:05,259 --> 00:49:07,639
We can't let those ashes
stand overnight.

598
00:49:07,845 --> 00:49:11,765
The brush in this hill
is a regular tinderbox.

599
00:49:12,432 --> 00:49:14,432
You wanna help me?

600
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:24,235
All right,
you feeling better?

601
00:49:25,946 --> 00:49:29,316
It's as if I destroyed her
with my own hands.

602
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:32,908
She'll come back, Eric.

603
00:49:34,746 --> 00:49:35,746
She'll come back.

604
00:49:35,914 --> 00:49:37,434
Darling, if you go on talking
that way,

605
00:49:37,499 --> 00:49:39,499
you destroy the whole purpose.

606
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:42,300
Now, the thing is out
of the house, and it's over.

607
00:49:42,504 --> 00:49:46,304
You just give it half a chance,
and you'll begin to forget it.

608
00:49:48,343 --> 00:49:50,643
And if you'll just spread
those ashes out a little for me,

609
00:49:50,846 --> 00:49:53,216
I'll get the water to it.

610
00:49:54,808 --> 00:49:56,138
That's it.

611
00:50:09,364 --> 00:50:10,364
Eric!

612
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:13,292
Eric!

613
00:50:13,493 --> 00:50:14,493
What is it, darling?

614
00:50:14,703 --> 00:50:15,873
That skull!

615
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,869
It's the skull!

616
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:20,331
Darling,
there's no skull there.

617
00:50:20,542 --> 00:50:22,212
There's no skull there,
darling.

618
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:26,169
There is no skull there,
Jenni, darling.

619
00:50:26,381 --> 00:50:28,631
There's no skull there.

620
00:50:28,842 --> 00:50:29,842
There's no skull.

621
00:51:39,913 --> 00:51:42,373
We'll be able to catch
a plane tonight?

622
00:51:42,582 --> 00:51:45,542
When we get into town,
I will call Mr. Mauer.

623
00:51:45,752 --> 00:51:47,552
He'll arrange
a midnight plane.

624
00:51:47,754 --> 00:51:49,844
I thought there'd be
more time.

625
00:51:50,048 --> 00:51:52,378
Time for so many
wonderful things.

626
00:51:52,592 --> 00:51:55,262
It's gonna be all right.

627
00:51:56,471 --> 00:51:57,471
Of course.

628
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:03,690
It's just me.

629
00:52:07,107 --> 00:52:09,607
It's gonna be all right.

630
00:52:16,658 --> 00:52:17,868
Good evening, my dear.

631
00:52:18,076 --> 00:52:20,236
Mrs. Snow's hens thought
you might like some fresh eggs

632
00:52:20,412 --> 00:52:22,292
for your breakfast
in the morning.

633
00:52:22,497 --> 00:52:23,617
Hello, Eric.

634
00:52:23,832 --> 00:52:25,252
This is a surprise.

635
00:52:25,459 --> 00:52:28,039
Those hens labored mightily,
as you can see.

636
00:52:28,253 --> 00:52:29,923
Fine, I'll take them.

637
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:33,679
If you'll excuse me, dear.

638
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:34,934
Of course.

639
00:52:38,346 --> 00:52:39,716
What is it, Eric?

640
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:43,979
I've got to take Jenni away.

641
00:52:44,186 --> 00:52:45,896
That hospital
she was in before.

642
00:52:46,104 --> 00:52:48,234
It happened again?

643
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,650
I thought it would help her
if we got rid of that portrait.

644
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,990
- You know the one.
- Yes.

645
00:52:54,196 --> 00:52:55,816
And we burned it.

646
00:52:56,031 --> 00:52:58,281
She saw a skull in the ashes.

647
00:52:58,492 --> 00:52:59,492
You were there?

648
00:52:59,618 --> 00:53:01,158
I saw nothing, of course.

649
00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:02,539
Of course.

650
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:04,746
And I thought it was Mickey.

651
00:53:04,956 --> 00:53:08,126
But when I was there myself,
and I saw her...

652
00:53:10,295 --> 00:53:12,915
Mr. Snow, there's something
I've never told you,

653
00:53:13,131 --> 00:53:15,551
I've never told anybody,

654
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:18,799
but when Jenni was put away
in that hospital,

655
00:53:19,846 --> 00:53:23,016
she tried to do away
with herself.

656
00:53:23,225 --> 00:53:24,475
I'm terribly afraid.

657
00:53:24,684 --> 00:53:26,104
You think she might
try it again?

658
00:53:26,311 --> 00:53:27,731
I know she will.

659
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:29,858
Unless I get her back
to that hospital.

660
00:53:30,065 --> 00:53:31,225
When are you going?

661
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:32,941
Tonight.

662
00:53:33,151 --> 00:53:34,781
We shall miss you.

663
00:53:34,986 --> 00:53:37,606
Mrs. Snow and I have grown
very fond of Jenni.

664
00:53:37,823 --> 00:53:40,283
Yes, and she of you.

665
00:53:40,492 --> 00:53:42,662
I don't suppose you'll be
coming back here again, Eric?

666
00:53:42,869 --> 00:53:44,079
No.

667
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:45,577
Never.

668
00:53:49,417 --> 00:53:52,377
I'll miss him and his wife.

669
00:53:52,754 --> 00:53:54,344
He's very kind.

670
00:53:54,548 --> 00:53:56,508
Yes.

671
00:53:56,716 --> 00:53:58,626
And I said goodbye to him
just now.

672
00:53:58,844 --> 00:54:01,604
He tried to talk me out
of what I saw.

673
00:54:01,888 --> 00:54:03,718
How?

674
00:54:03,932 --> 00:54:06,272
He said he felt the skull
was real.

675
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:08,196
He's gonna bring
some men in the morning

676
00:54:08,228 --> 00:54:10,268
to search the estate.

677
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,060
Where?

678
00:54:12,274 --> 00:54:13,734
Everywhere.

679
00:54:16,236 --> 00:54:19,026
He's just talking,
trying to be kind.

680
00:54:19,239 --> 00:54:20,949
I suppose.

681
00:54:25,453 --> 00:54:28,583
I'll go upstairs and pack.

682
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:30,916
You wanna come with me?

683
00:54:31,126 --> 00:54:33,626
I'll be up in a minute.

684
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:27,723
Mickey!

685
00:55:27,933 --> 00:55:28,933
Mickey!

686
00:55:29,976 --> 00:55:31,096
Mickey!

687
00:55:51,539 --> 00:55:52,539
All right.

688
00:55:52,666 --> 00:55:55,086
Where's the skull at?
You saw me put it in the pond,

689
00:55:55,293 --> 00:55:57,023
- you must have. Where is it?
- I don't know.

690
00:55:57,045 --> 00:55:58,365
- I don't know.
- Don't lie to me!

691
00:55:58,546 --> 00:55:59,956
Don't lie to me.
Where is it?

692
00:56:00,173 --> 00:56:02,093
- I don't know!
- Tell me the truth.

693
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,630
Who took it?

694
00:56:03,843 --> 00:56:05,303
Tell me, tell me.

695
00:56:05,512 --> 00:56:07,062
- Tell me!
- I didn't take it!

696
00:56:07,264 --> 00:56:08,684
- I didn't take it!
- Who?

697
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:11,230
- Who?
- Not me, not me!

698
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:12,564
Who?

699
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:14,229
Marion! Marion, took it!

700
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:16,977
Marion took it.

701
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:18,730
You and your Marion!

702
00:56:46,219 --> 00:56:47,799
All right!

703
00:57:45,945 --> 00:57:49,065
Oh, Edward,
in the name of heaven.

704
00:57:49,282 --> 00:57:51,122
Mickey, where
did you find this?

705
00:57:51,326 --> 00:57:52,326
Pond.

706
00:57:52,452 --> 00:57:53,452
Well, who put it there?

707
00:57:53,578 --> 00:57:54,618
- He did.
- Eric?

708
00:57:54,829 --> 00:57:55,829
He did.

709
00:57:55,955 --> 00:57:57,915
Then, there was a skull.

710
00:57:58,124 --> 00:58:00,714
But Eric said that he didn't
see it when Jenni saw it.

711
00:58:00,919 --> 00:58:01,919
I know.

712
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:04,295
Oh, but why would Eric
lie like that?

713
00:58:04,506 --> 00:58:06,506
Mickey, those other times
with the skull,

714
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:07,716
did you do it?

715
00:58:07,842 --> 00:58:08,842
No.

716
00:58:08,968 --> 00:58:10,548
Mickey, you've never
lied to me before.

717
00:58:10,762 --> 00:58:13,312
Lying is a sin,
you understand that?

718
00:58:13,515 --> 00:58:14,885
You must not lie to me now.

719
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,830
Did you do it, Mickey,
all those other times?

720
00:58:16,851 --> 00:58:17,851
No.

721
00:58:17,977 --> 00:58:19,397
I simply do not
understand that.

722
00:58:19,604 --> 00:58:20,944
If it wasn't Mickey...

723
00:58:21,147 --> 00:58:23,107
And it wasn't
her imagination...

724
00:58:23,316 --> 00:58:25,936
But why would Eric
do such a thing?

725
00:58:26,152 --> 00:58:27,992
I don't know,
i just don't know.

726
00:58:28,196 --> 00:58:30,156
Well, what do you think
we should do about it?

727
00:58:30,365 --> 00:58:31,865
We're going back there
to that house.

728
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:33,195
All right.

729
00:58:58,643 --> 00:58:59,773
Mickey?

730
00:59:37,265 --> 00:59:38,885
Mickey?

731
00:59:40,226 --> 00:59:43,306
Eric and I are leaving,
Mickey.

732
00:59:43,521 --> 00:59:46,151
I'd like to say goodbye.

733
00:59:47,233 --> 00:59:50,403
I'd like to leave
as your friend, Mickey.

734
00:59:56,784 --> 00:59:58,954
Mickey?

735
01:00:01,456 --> 01:00:02,576
Mickey?

736
01:01:11,192 --> 01:01:13,492
Eric! Eric!

737
01:01:13,695 --> 01:01:15,065
Eric!

738
01:01:38,595 --> 01:01:40,255
Eric!

739
01:05:52,723 --> 01:05:54,433
Jenni?

740
01:05:54,642 --> 01:05:55,812
Jenni!

741
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:57,018
What happened?

742
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:58,846
Jenni,

743
01:05:59,063 --> 01:06:01,823
Jenni, are you all right?

744
01:06:02,024 --> 01:06:03,534
Oh, Jenni?

745
01:06:06,445 --> 01:06:08,945
Eric...

746
01:06:09,156 --> 01:06:10,156
Eric tried...

747
01:06:10,283 --> 01:06:13,043
- Shh, oh, don't, don't.
- Where is Eric?

748
01:06:14,871 --> 01:06:16,371
I don't know.

749
01:06:17,915 --> 01:06:19,455
- I don't know.
- I'll find him.

750
01:06:19,667 --> 01:06:21,017
It's all right.
Edward, now, be careful.

752
01:06:22,628 --> 01:06:23,958
It's all right, darling.

753
01:06:24,171 --> 01:06:26,381
Oh, it's all right.

754
01:06:26,591 --> 01:06:28,341
Oh, it's all right.

755
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:30,341
All right, come on.

756
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:33,715
Eric?

757
01:06:34,849 --> 01:06:35,849
Eric?

758
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:38,138
Please answer me.

759
01:06:38,352 --> 01:06:39,522
Eric?

760
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:40,979
Eric?

761
01:06:43,482 --> 01:06:44,942
Eric, where are you?

762
01:06:46,527 --> 01:06:49,027
Eric?

763
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:50,318
Eric?

764
01:07:00,958 --> 01:07:02,498
Eric.

765
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:15,143
Why did he do it?

766
01:07:15,348 --> 01:07:17,678
Your money.

767
01:07:17,892 --> 01:07:20,732
The question is now,
did Marion die in an accident?

768
01:07:20,937 --> 01:07:22,187
I suppose we'll never know.

769
01:07:49,507 --> 01:07:51,507
They're gone.

770
01:07:51,717 --> 01:07:52,837
Rest.
