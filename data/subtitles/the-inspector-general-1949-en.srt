1
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:39,238
- I have to see the Mayor.
- He's in a council meeting and he
can't be disturbed.

2
00:01:39,437 --> 00:01:42,419
- I demand that you let me through.
- I've ridden all night, 80 miles.
That's the orders.

3
00:01:42,618 --> 00:01:44,606
Get out of my way.

4
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:47,787
Stop! I said STOP!

5
00:01:49,973 --> 00:01:52,955
- I must see the Mayor.
- But the Mayor is in council meetings.

6
00:01:53,353 --> 00:01:57,527
-Let go of me. You'll be sorry, I'm a
relavtive of the Mayor's.
- So am I, so is the whole council.

7
00:01:57,925 --> 00:02:02,100
Where's the council room? Cousin Bryo.

8
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:06,473
- Stop making so much noise,
they're in a meeting.
- What is all this commotion?

9
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:09,256
Counsin Gregor, cousin Bryo.

10
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:15,220
- This is my cousin, the Mayor of Trebin.
- I'm sorry, this man he tried to...

11
00:02:15,617 --> 00:02:18,798
- Come in here.
- Counsin Gregor.

12
00:02:19,593 --> 00:02:23,768
- I've been riding all night. It's a disaster.
- Come and sit down. Fetch brandy and water.

13
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:27,346
-No water....
-Come on, tell what's happened. Speak up.

14
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:32,117
Like thunder, he appeared among us.
The postmaster was hanged, and the
chief of police was let off with 200 lashes.

15
00:02:32,515 --> 00:02:37,286
I was sentenced to the firing squad.
Lucky for me, the rifles blew up and I escaped.

16
00:02:37,683 --> 00:02:42,057
- I need a fresh horse. I must be off at once.
- A fresh horse for our cousin.
Sit down, sit down.

17
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:45,237
- I must go. Even now, he may be
here in your midst. - Who?

18
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:49,213
- Speak up man, who?
- The Inspector General.

19
00:02:50,008 --> 00:02:55,972
Yes, he has full power from the Emporer himself.
And where ever he finds bribery and coruption,
that's where the gallows and firing squads go to work.

20
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,346
- More!
- What does he look like, this Inspector General?

21
00:03:00,544 --> 00:03:04,719
Who knows? A man of mystery.
Five days he was in our midst and
no one even suspected it.

22
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:08,099
He went everywhere, saw
everything and uncovered such
coruption that even I was shocked.

23
00:03:08,496 --> 00:03:13,864
- Now don't get excited.
- Don't get excited! How I envy
you, secure in your clean town and fear no one.

24
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:18,436
- The horse is ready, Uncle Byro.
I must be off.
- Oh Gregor, where will you go?

25
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:22,412
Far away anywhere, Africa, China...
Good-bye cousin Byro.

26
00:03:22,809 --> 00:03:25,195
Farewell Uncle.

27
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,177
Good-bye cousin.

28
00:03:30,562 --> 00:03:34,140
Do you need any money?
I have a few crowns.

29
00:03:36,526 --> 00:03:38,911
Thank-you.

30
00:03:40,104 --> 00:03:41,694
City Funds.

31
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,279
Farewell.

32
00:03:58,194 --> 00:04:02,766
I would like to take this opportunity
to tend to my resignation.

33
00:04:03,164 --> 00:04:08,730
SIT DOWN! What would you do?
Go back to rolling pills in that stink
shop of a chemist?

34
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:16,483
- I promised my wife.......
- I have to talk to my sister.....

35
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,703
STAY WHERE YOU ARE! Nothing
is to be gained by rushing around blindly.

36
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,877
We must proceed according to
system. You Lazlo, clean up the square.

37
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:35,175
You Toleki. Get the children back
into school. Start teaching them
something, anything.

38
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:38,555
You two deliver the mail, all of it,
whether you've read it or not.

39
00:04:38,952 --> 00:04:41,934
- I never read the mail.
- Yes you did, don't you remember?

40
00:04:46,307 --> 00:04:48,693
Kovak, come back here.

41
00:04:49,886 --> 00:04:54,458
I want all roads policed day and night.
I want a report of everyone
who's entered this town in the past 24 hours.

42
00:04:54,575 --> 00:04:58,948
Check the tavern. lnvestigate all
strangers. Bring your reports to me
personally, do you understand?

43
00:04:59,147 --> 00:05:04,117
- es, but first I would like to.....
- First you will obey orders. Now
get out of here.

44
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:09,086
Thank-you.

45
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:21,761
Order double guards at the city
gates and patrol all roads to Brodny at once.

46
00:05:22,082 --> 00:05:24,269
AT ONCE!

47
00:05:27,648 --> 00:05:30,232
- Come with me.
- What goes with Uncle General?

48
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,618
I said come with me.

49
00:05:36,594 --> 00:05:39,377
- Anything wrong.
- Quiet.

50
00:05:42,955 --> 00:05:44,545
Quiet you.

51
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:59,046
I shall investigate here. You men
go on to the next town.

52
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:17,033
Countrymen approach. Step up,
step up. Come close for the
greatest experience of your life.

53
00:06:17,431 --> 00:06:20,015
You will tell your children and
grandchildren about this.

54
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:26,178
First you will be entertained by the
greatest musicians in the country
right from the court of the Emporer.

55
00:06:26,576 --> 00:06:32,340
Yakov's exlixsir, the best that can
be had. Yakov's elixsir is good for
what is bad.

56
00:06:43,852 --> 00:06:47,232
Now my good people, step closer
so that you may see with your own eyes.

57
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:52,003
I Yakov Guli, positioned to Princes
and crown heads come among you to...

58
00:06:52,202 --> 00:06:59,159
exhibit absolutely free of charge the
wonder of the world and parellel
since the dawn of time.

59
00:06:59,557 --> 00:07:06,912
Are you ready my friends? The
Egyptian marvel, the treasure of the
Pharohs. Behold!

60
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:16,256
- tep right up people. Examine, observe.
- You there! Who are you? Let me
see your peddlar card.

61
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:22,418
Here you go Captain. Yakov Guli.
An honest professional man from Pribirk.
I have testimonials from the Emporer himself.

62
00:07:23,213 --> 00:07:26,593
- Never mind.
- What about your friend there?
Who him?

63
00:07:29,376 --> 00:07:34,544
Captain, don't run away, come
back. We welcome all investigations.

64
00:07:34,942 --> 00:07:38,321
Look my friends. It lives, it breathes.

65
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:42,894
It laughs, it cries, it thinks.

66
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,267
Watch his left ear. How much is 2 + 2?

67
00:07:49,154 --> 00:07:55,316
Correct! This is not just an old
head. This is Prince Ahmed of ancient Egypt.

68
00:07:55,515 --> 00:08:01,479
Beheaded by the cruel Pharoh,
because of his forbidden love for
the crown Princess.

69
00:08:01,877 --> 00:08:08,039
And now my friends you ask
yourselves, How has this miracle
survived for over 2000 years?

70
00:08:08,437 --> 00:08:14,599
An excellent question. Only this.
Yakov's Golden Elixsir.

71
00:08:14,997 --> 00:08:18,973
Look how his eyes plead with me to
give him a dose of my elixsir.

72
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,750
He really yearns for its richness.

73
00:08:26,726 --> 00:08:31,695
I am a simple man my friends. I do
not make extravagant claims for my medicine.

74
00:08:32,093 --> 00:08:35,075
If a person is already dead, for instance...

75
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:38,653
there is only a slim chance that my
medicine will do him any good.

76
00:08:39,448 --> 00:08:42,430
But if only a spark of life remains....

77
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:48,195
Yakov's Golden Elixsir will fan it into
a roaring fire of health.

78
00:09:01,514 --> 00:09:05,689
How can Yakov cheat those poor people
like that? Why what's the matter? Well
this is the furniture polish he sold yesterday?

79
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:08,074
Come on, hurry up. He's almost through.

80
00:09:09,863 --> 00:09:14,237
- No, you don't wear this.
- Here is the testimonials from my
grateful customers.

81
00:09:14,436 --> 00:09:19,604
Even from the great Napoleon
himself, written on the battlefield of Austerlitz.

82
00:09:19,803 --> 00:09:22,785
He gives the elixsir full credit for the victory.

83
00:09:23,183 --> 00:09:26,164
For years I've suffered terrible
digestive depress."

84
00:09:26,562 --> 00:09:31,532
However since taking Yakov's
mircle elilxsir, I no longer find it
necessary to.....

85
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:34,116
continuously hold my hand on my
stomach."

86
00:09:34,911 --> 00:09:37,496
Kindest personal regards:
Napoleon."

87
00:09:45,447 --> 00:09:49,224
But why do I tell you these things
my friends when there is someone here....

88
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:54,592
a sufferer on whom I've looked with
compassion when he lay on death's door.

89
00:09:54,989 --> 00:09:58,766
Unable to move a muscle.
Paralyzed!

90
00:10:00,555 --> 00:10:06,718
Friend, are you aware that you are
losing your hair?

91
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:11,688
Do you need money? Have you
been on a diet?

92
00:10:11,887 --> 00:10:19,043
Are you bothered by quiet?
Quiet.....QUIET!

93
00:10:20,435 --> 00:10:22,224
Nice dancer that fellow.

94
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:29,579
Do you get colds, or prickly heat, a
burning brow, blazing feet, a
leaping pulse...

95
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:34,549
or Hic-cups? Do you get Hic-cup?

96
00:10:34,947 --> 00:10:41,109
A touch of laryngitis, asthama, or
appendincitis, or hic-cups......

97
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:45,681
or hic......cups.

98
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:53,832
Or measles, a diagnosis of
phycosis...

99
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,603
Have you ever been short of breath?

100
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,771
Well, cheer up, cheer up, cheer up.

101
00:11:01,224 --> 00:11:06,696
No matter how bad your condition.
I have news that will tickle your ears.

102
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:11,514
- I was dead.
- Dead?

103
00:11:11,912 --> 00:11:14,496
Well, pretty sick.

104
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:19,069
Til I saw a famous physician, who
hadn't seen a patient in years.

105
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:22,249
He was near-sighted.

106
00:11:22,846 --> 00:11:26,821
He said, hello young man, you are
possibly the plumber.

107
00:11:27,418 --> 00:11:31,990
I'm a patient Dr. Hummer. Dr.
Hummer said, hhhhmmmmmm.

108
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:42,327
Dr. Hummer said hmmmmm, with a
C. Dr. Cinger. Dr. Cinger said
aaaaaahhh.

109
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,454
You have something with your nose
and something with your sneezes.
Tell me young man.

110
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:58,628
You've had some diseases? Have I had.....

111
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:04,194
When I was one I had a.....

112
00:12:04,592 --> 00:12:06,977
When I was two I had a..

113
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,761
When I was three I had..

114
00:12:10,158 --> 00:12:12,941
By the time I was four...

115
00:12:14,532 --> 00:12:16,917
When I was six I had a....

116
00:12:17,315 --> 00:12:20,098
At seven I developed...

117
00:12:20,893 --> 00:12:23,477
When I was eight I got a....

118
00:12:24,272 --> 00:12:27,055
By the time I was nine....

119
00:12:30,236 --> 00:12:33,019
Doctor, why am I always so tired?

120
00:12:35,604 --> 00:12:39,579
Doctor Cinger said
aaaaaaaaahhhhh.

121
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,953
And gave me the following
perscription.

122
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:56,477
Zalaminhalticnol, twice a day.

123
00:12:58,067 --> 00:13:04,230
Since that day I haven't been sick
sir. And that medicine did the trick
sir. What was it, don't ask me.

124
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:08,647
I'll tell you.

125
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:17,990
Yakov's Golden Elixsir.

126
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:33,894
Come my friends. Who will be the
first to buy Yakov's Elixsir?

127
00:13:37,273 --> 00:13:41,845
I have 12 pennies. My husband is
sick. Maybe if he had your
medicine, he'd get well.

128
00:13:42,243 --> 00:13:45,821
Go away please. Will you take one here?

129
00:13:48,604 --> 00:13:51,387
Sell it to her. Why, I did very well I
sold three. Ooooohhhh.

130
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:57,914
Here you go mother. What ever is
wrong with your husband, he is now cured.

131
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:03,480
All right ladies and gentlemen, here
it is. The most wonderful, the most
miraclous all cure. The Golden Elixsir.

132
00:14:03,878 --> 00:14:06,860
- Mother, I'll give you your pennies,
give me back the medicine. - No!

133
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,631
- The medicine is no good.
- It's for my husband. He needs it, he's sick.

134
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:16,601
I know and this will fi nish him off.
Take the pennies and buy milk. It
will be better than the medicine.

135
00:14:16,998 --> 00:14:20,775
Do you remember me? I'm the
fellow with all the diseases, but
there is nothing wrong with me.

136
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:24,155
The medicine is a fake, I'm a fake,
Yakov is a fake.

137
00:14:24,552 --> 00:14:28,727
This is no good. I tell you mother, we are
cheating all the people, don't you see?
We wash windows with it, furniture polish.

138
00:14:29,522 --> 00:14:32,703
All the people. Pardon me. All the
people back there.

139
00:14:35,883 --> 00:14:37,871
Yakov!

140
00:15:06,895 --> 00:15:09,479
Yakov...Yakov!

141
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,250
Georgi... Georgi!

142
00:15:48,588 --> 00:15:50,377
You....

143
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:07,880
Look Yakov, a fish.

144
00:16:08,477 --> 00:16:12,651
We can have supper now. Put it
near the flame.

145
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:16,627
- It's mine Yakov.
- It's mine now. Yeah, but I caught it.
I took it.

146
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:20,603
When you learn a little more about
taking and a little less about giving,
you can come back.

147
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,970
- I'm sorry about that poor old woman.
- Being sentimental is not good.

148
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:31,735
In this life it's dog eat dog. Bite and
scratch. Grab everything for
yourself and hold on like a leech.

149
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:36,506
- You can't even pick a pocket.
- Yes I can so do it.

150
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:40,085
I'm a good thief Yakov. Even better
than you, see?

151
00:16:40,681 --> 00:16:44,856
- That's my watch.
- When did you get it? In the water.

152
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:49,229
Please Yakov don't send me off. I'll
do anything you want. I'll be hard as nails.

153
00:16:49,627 --> 00:16:54,000
- I'll steal my own mother's teeth.
-I'll believe it when I see it, get out.

154
00:16:55,193 --> 00:16:58,373
Oh all right, I'll go.

155
00:16:59,566 --> 00:17:03,144
- Right after supper.
- You get out of here.

156
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:07,518
- Why you iliterate numbskull you.
- I'm not iliterate!

157
00:17:07,915 --> 00:17:13,084
You're not huh? Read that.

158
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:16,265
- Read it?
- Read it!

159
00:17:19,843 --> 00:17:24,018
- Who can read on am empty stomach?
- Read it and I'll give you supper.

160
00:17:24,216 --> 00:17:27,198
It's say ah, ah.

161
00:17:27,596 --> 00:17:31,373
Oh this is very interesting. Your
handwriting shows defi nite
character, it shows...

162
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:34,951
your generous and wouldn't refuse
a hungry man...

163
00:17:35,548 --> 00:17:40,517
- Read it!
- It says, dear sir.

164
00:17:40,915 --> 00:17:45,686
- It says, "To whom it may concern".
- That's right, I was testing you.

165
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:56,818
Best personal regards, Napoleon.
Here you are.

166
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:04,770
- Maybe I can't read or write, but I'm not iliterate.
- You're nothing just a mill stone, get 
out of here.

167
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:08,547
- GET OUT!
-Good-bye Yakov.

168
00:18:16,101 --> 00:18:20,077
To Whom It May Concern. What a
silly way to start a letter.

169
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:53,673
To Whom It May Concern. What a
silly way to start a letter.

170
00:19:40,978 --> 00:19:44,158
The sailor loves the sea when the
wind blows fair.

171
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:47,935
The Arab loves the desert and the
sand which is there. The Farmer.

172
00:19:49,128 --> 00:19:50,718
Sandwiches...

173
00:20:14,772 --> 00:20:18,947
- Go get it.
- Oh, just the bottom of the barrel.

174
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:23,122
What do you want?

175
00:20:24,314 --> 00:20:28,688
I thought you men wouldn't mind
sharing a little of your food with a....

176
00:20:29,085 --> 00:20:32,664
- On your way you tramp. We
hardly got enough for ourselves.
- Go on, get on your way.

177
00:20:36,838 --> 00:20:41,212
- Well you just gave a little piece to the dog.
- The dog does something for his food.

178
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:44,194
What'd I tell you. Go on. Go away.

179
00:20:57,513 --> 00:21:01,290
- Oh he's moody.
- If I could just have a little piece.

180
00:21:00,582 --> 00:21:04,161
Wait a minute. Otto, come here.
Roll over.

181
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:12,779
- Can you do that? Could I have a little piece?
- Can you do that?

182
00:21:13,176 --> 00:21:16,755
Roll over? Let's
see you do that.

183
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,321
Hurry up. Lie down, lie down.

184
00:21:26,694 --> 00:21:31,068
Wait a minute. I bet he can run
faster than you can.

185
00:21:50,748 --> 00:21:53,929
No thanks Otto. You won it fair and
square.

186
00:21:55,122 --> 00:21:57,706
A bargain is a bargain.

187
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,566
Any good?

188
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:29,927
Would you mind if I tasted a few?
I haven't had anything to eat in a
couple of days.

189
00:23:31,716 --> 00:23:35,295
I appreciate this. Thank-you very much.

190
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:45,632
Don't put that heavy stuff on top of
the crystal. Where's the wagon?

191
00:23:48,216 --> 00:23:52,391
- Now please go back.
- Stop thief! Go get him.

192
00:23:53,981 --> 00:23:56,963
-Stop that thief. Is there somebody
over there that can stop that thief?
- I caught you, you thief!

193
00:23:57,361 --> 00:24:01,933
Who me? You have the wrong
person. The horse followed me, I'm innocent.

194
00:24:02,344 --> 00:24:07,313
Then you'll hang with a clear conscience.
Take him to jail. Take him away.

195
00:24:07,711 --> 00:24:11,289
Hold it, hold it. I'm innocent. Stop!
Ask the horse, I'm innocent.

196
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:15,685
Gentlemen.

197
00:24:17,871 --> 00:24:22,444
- To business. Gizzy or is it Izzy?
- I'm Izzy uncle.

198
00:24:22,841 --> 00:24:28,010
- You can always tell by the strawberry mark.
- Never mind. The hospital, have
you cleaned it up?

199
00:24:28,407 --> 00:24:31,389
We cleaned up the floor, put sheets
on the bed and got the goats out of surgery.

200
00:24:31,787 --> 00:24:34,967
And I put charts on each of the
patients beds, indicating the nature
of their illness.

201
00:24:35,365 --> 00:24:38,148
Good, at least now they'll know
what they die from. Kovach...

202
00:24:38,546 --> 00:24:41,528
Well, I've patrolled all the roads
leading to and from Brodny.

203
00:24:41,726 --> 00:24:48,485
So unless the Inspector General decides
to disguise himself like a bird and fly
into the city, he'll never get past me.

204
00:24:48,684 --> 00:24:53,256
- Good. And the jail?
- I've had new locks fitted to all the
cells, burned all the rubbish.

205
00:24:53,455 --> 00:24:57,232
- I even have a prisoner.
- Good, who is he?

206
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,208
Oh I don't know , just a tramp.
I apprehended him in the city square.

207
00:25:01,407 --> 00:25:04,985
He was trying to make off with a
horse and wagon, the one we were
loading with silver.

208
00:25:05,184 --> 00:25:09,557
- My silver? My valuables?
- Yes, but I got him before he.....

209
00:25:09,955 --> 00:25:14,527
- Who is he? Where did he come from?
- Oh I don't know he's just......

210
00:25:15,322 --> 00:25:18,304
a common tramp. Dressed in rags.

211
00:25:28,244 --> 00:25:31,822
You idiot! Did you cite him,
question him?

212
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,394
It was so near lunch time and he
was just a common tramp.

213
00:25:38,382 --> 00:25:41,762
The Inspector General? Well that's
ridiculous.

214
00:25:43,153 --> 00:25:46,930
Why not a tramp? In Falsburg he
appeared as a travelling shoe salesman.

215
00:25:47,328 --> 00:25:51,701
In Clamatti he was disguised as a
peddler. And here, why not a tramp?

216
00:25:52,298 --> 00:25:56,075
My horse and wagon. The wagon I
loaded with valuables to ship out of town.

217
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:59,454
Of course, the evidence he needed.
Now he knows.

218
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:04,026
-I would like to take this opportunity
to tender my resignation.
- To the jail.

219
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,779
Who's there?

220
00:26:27,484 --> 00:26:31,460
- Want some water? Water?
- I want some food.

221
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:38,219
- I'm sorry. The prisoners are fed
promptly at 3 o'clock.
- I guess I can hold out til then.

222
00:26:39,411 --> 00:26:44,182
- Wednesday and Saturday.
- But today is Thursday.

223
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:49,947
- What is time?
- Look I haven't eaten in two days.

224
00:26:50,345 --> 00:26:56,309
What kind of jail is this where they
won't even give a man a crust of
bread. All I want is a little piece of food there.

225
00:26:56,905 --> 00:27:02,471
This is a nice jail. Really it is.
We've had some nice hangings here.

226
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:08,634
- What's nice about the hanging?
- Oh, you should see the ceremony.

227
00:27:09,031 --> 00:27:12,610
- And the last meal.
- The last meal?

228
00:27:13,206 --> 00:27:19,567
- Can you order anything you like?
- Anything! The town of Brodny
may have its faults, but they certainly
do it right when they hang a man.

229
00:27:19,965 --> 00:27:23,941
The Mayor and all the commissionaires
come dressed in their finest clothes.

230
00:27:24,338 --> 00:27:27,320
And the town band assemblies at
the door of the jail.

231
00:27:27,718 --> 00:27:31,893
Such beautiful music. And they
play the prisoner right up to the gallows.

232
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:35,272
- I'll never forget one hanging we
had a few years ago. - What's that?

233
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:38,651
- What's what?
- What's that music?

234
00:27:49,386 --> 00:27:53,362
-What were you arrested for?
- Nothing, I'm innocent.

235
00:27:53,561 --> 00:27:56,742
It the commissionaires and
everybody and they brought the band.

236
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:01,513
Who are they going to hang?

237
00:28:02,904 --> 00:28:08,073
- There's only one prisoner here.
- Well, if he doesn't fi nish his last meal...

238
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:13,838
HELP! HELP! HELP!

239
00:28:14,832 --> 00:28:18,211
You let me out of the jail, you hear,
or I'll go right to the Emporer.

240
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:22,783
Help! What a fine crooked village this
much be. The thieves you must have here.

241
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,560
Let me out! Help! Help!

242
00:28:28,151 --> 00:28:31,928
- A common tramp eh?
- Why was I put in this jail? Help!

243
00:28:32,325 --> 00:28:35,705
- Open the gate.
- No trial, no justice.

244
00:28:36,102 --> 00:28:40,277
I will report this to the Emporer.
This is a crooked village, this is.

245
00:28:40,476 --> 00:28:46,638
Don't any of you come near me. If
any of you come near me. I
demand to be released.

246
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:51,409
If you have been put to any
inconvience, I assure you that my
colleagues and myself are deeply destressed.

247
00:28:56,777 --> 00:29:00,554
This is just a small community. Not
rich or powerful.

248
00:29:08,135 --> 00:29:12,310
Be it citizens or travellers, be they
humbled or clothed to the highest
degree of nobility....

249
00:29:12,707 --> 00:29:15,490
be they vagrants or inspector
generals appointed by the Emporer...

250
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:20,261
in our village they find courtsey, honor and
strict adherence to the principals of justice.

251
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,809
Command us you Excellency and
we will obey.

252
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:36,165
Believe me your Highness,
I nderstand and value your desire to
remain incognito.

253
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,749
Permit me to compliment you on
your amazing disguise. It's most convincing.

254
00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:46,701
In a corrupt city, with dishonest officials,
such a strategy would be most effective.

255
00:29:47,098 --> 00:29:52,665
But here in our fair village of
Brodny, we beg you to accept our hospitalilty.

256
00:29:53,062 --> 00:29:56,839
Why don't we discuss the entire
situation at dinner.

257
00:29:57,634 --> 00:30:01,809
Go to my house and tell my wife we
have an honored guest. To her to
make a feast, a banquet.

258
00:30:02,207 --> 00:30:07,176
Your Excellency, how can we talk in
these sordid sourroundings? At my
home, dinner will be just about ready.

259
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:12,345
A roast, a turkey, several kinds of
game, a rack of lamb and a
magnificent pot-roast.

260
00:30:12,743 --> 00:30:16,122
You will probably want a change of
clothes. Quick, some suitable
clothing for His Excellency.

261
00:30:16,321 --> 00:30:20,495
- Where will I get the clothing?
- Your uniform, take it off. Now?

262
00:30:21,092 --> 00:30:25,068
Your Excellency. Our chief of police
regrets his mistake.

263
00:30:25,465 --> 00:30:29,640
He will be delighted for you to wear
his uniform until your luggage arrives.

264
00:30:30,435 --> 00:30:34,808
-He's tall, I know he is. Is he going
to stay long? - I hope not.

265
00:30:35,206 --> 00:30:37,989
- What's taking you so long, hurry.
- But I can't get it, it's too tight.

266
00:30:38,387 --> 00:30:44,152
I wonder if the Inspector General will think
it's too tight? Tell me did you notice the
color of his eyes? Are they blue?

267
00:30:46,338 --> 00:30:49,122
What are you staring at stupid?
Get busy and set the table.

268
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:54,887
And you two. When you serve, see
that your hands are clean. You
Bela, you remove the dishes when I ring.

269
00:30:55,284 --> 00:30:59,459
Lateues, you bring on the fresh
course and move quickly and see
that you don't spill anything on our guests.

270
00:31:00,254 --> 00:31:04,031
- Did you hear me?
- What did I say? I take a bowl of fruits.

271
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:07,212
- When?
- When you ring the bell.

272
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:11,386
Lisa you serve the wine and do
anything else to make yourself
useful. Come Burbus.

273
00:31:11,784 --> 00:31:16,157
Put on a clean apron. Did he say
anything about Paris? Budapest? Vienna?

274
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:20,133
That dress was too tight. So tight, it
made her eyes pop out.

275
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:33,055
This is my humble home, Your
Excellency. It isn't large, I've only a
small pittance of a salary.

276
00:31:41,006 --> 00:31:42,795
Maria, my jewel. Maria.

277
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:50,548
You're Excellency, this is my wife, Maria.
His Excellency, The Inspector General.

278
00:31:51,145 --> 00:31:57,108
- Oh Your Excellency, this is such a pleasure.
- Let me take you hat and sword.

279
00:31:58,699 --> 00:32:01,879
Your Excellency, this is my wife Catherine.

280
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,060
Laslo...

281
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:09,632
We must get rid of him. I'll give him
plenty of brandy, anything to stop
the inspection. You get the glasses.

282
00:32:09,831 --> 00:32:14,403
A toast Your Excellency. Something
to prepare the pallate.

283
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,982
- I'll see about the dinner.
- Dinner?

284
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,964
Your Excellency, this way.

285
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:31,102
A toast to His Excellency. Love live
His Excellency.

286
00:32:35,277 --> 00:32:38,855
Laslo, get the wine, the brandy, quickly.

287
00:32:39,252 --> 00:32:42,831
Quickly. More brandy Bela.

288
00:32:43,626 --> 00:32:48,198
Now Your Excellency, how
charming it is.... May I present
Mrs. Burbus Your Excellency.

289
00:32:48,596 --> 00:32:51,776
She's the wife of our tax collector
and chemist.

290
00:32:51,975 --> 00:32:57,939
Here we are. Your Excellency, a
little more wine. And a toast to His
Majesty, The Emporer.

291
00:32:58,734 --> 00:33:01,318
Long live The Emporer.

292
00:33:08,077 --> 00:33:12,053
This is Izzy and his twin brother
Gizzy. They're in charge of our
postal department.

293
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:15,433
- The Inspector General Izzy.
- I'm not Izzy, he is.

294
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:20,601
- It's very easy to tell by the strawberry mark.
- No, no, no, some other time. One
more aperitif just before dinner.

295
00:33:21,993 --> 00:33:26,366
- Dinner is served.
-One last drink Your Excellency.

296
00:33:26,764 --> 00:33:29,746
Here's to the righteous.

297
00:33:31,535 --> 00:33:34,318
Here's to the evil-doer.

298
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:14,673
I suppose after Paris and Budapest,
your returning here must be very
distasteful?

299
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:21,233
What do you think of Switzerland? I
have relatives there. The
Berghoffs. Did you ever run across them?

300
00:34:22,028 --> 00:34:25,606
Your uniform is just beautiful One
husband has one just like it.

301
00:34:26,004 --> 00:34:29,980
I hope you're not disappointed in
the simple fair we serve here.

302
00:34:30,377 --> 00:34:34,552
Ladies and gentlemen! I would like
to propose a toast.

303
00:34:35,347 --> 00:34:39,919
To the fairest city in all the land. To
the home of courage, integrity and honesty.

304
00:34:40,317 --> 00:34:42,901
To Brodny.

305
00:34:52,642 --> 00:34:55,624
Even if I'd had time to prepare the
proper kind of dinner, I don't suppose....

306
00:34:56,021 --> 00:35:01,985
Your Excellency would have found it
comparable to the table they set at
The Emporer's Palace.

307
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:05,961
I do wish my husband had given me
a little more time.

308
00:35:07,154 --> 00:35:11,130
Maria! His Excellency's glass is empty.

309
00:35:12,521 --> 00:35:15,503
Lisa more wine. Quickly, quickly.

310
00:35:16,696 --> 00:35:21,069
After you've eaten, perhaps you'll
tell me about your life in Vienna?

311
00:35:25,443 --> 00:35:29,816
- I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to.
- That's all right, it was just an accident.

312
00:35:30,214 --> 00:35:32,798
Why you clumsy druge.

313
00:35:34,587 --> 00:35:39,756
Oh it was nothing, just merely an
accident. I always spill wine all
over my suit.

314
00:35:39,955 --> 00:35:44,726
She didn't mean it. It was just an
accident. Water is very good for wool.

315
00:35:45,322 --> 00:35:48,503
Just that she didn't mean it, it was
just an accident.

316
00:35:53,075 --> 00:35:55,460
She really didn't....

317
00:35:58,442 --> 00:36:03,014
Latus, bring on the meat course.
Bela the meat courses.

318
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:08,183
- Bring on the meat courses, quickly.
- Pardon me.

319
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:16,333
Is it true about the women in Paris?

320
00:38:12,948 --> 00:38:18,117
- Is there something wrong Your Excellency?
- Oh try this. I always carry it with
me, it'll cure anything.

321
00:38:41,574 --> 00:38:45,948
Good-morning Your Excellency.
I thought you would like a glass of
milk before breakfast.

322
00:38:46,345 --> 00:38:50,917
- How did I get here?
- We carried you up after dinner,
Your Excellency.

323
00:38:51,712 --> 00:38:56,285
We undressed you and you were in
a very playful mood, Your Excellency.

324
00:38:56,682 --> 00:39:01,056
-What a naughty Inspector General.
- What!?

325
00:39:04,236 --> 00:39:08,212
Maria. All right, all right. Good-
morning Your Excellency.

326
00:39:09,405 --> 00:39:15,170
- May I express the hope that you
spent a comfortable night.
- What time is it?

327
00:39:15,568 --> 00:39:20,935
It's just past nine. But you've ample
time for a substantial breakfast,

328
00:39:22,128 --> 00:39:27,098
Our program is 11 a.m., reception at
the Town Hall, and an inspection of
the Guard of Honor and a town concert.

329
00:39:27,296 --> 00:39:30,477
At 11:30 a parade to the jail and 12:
15 a public hanging.

330
00:39:30,676 --> 00:39:33,658
- Hanging?
- Followed by lunch.

331
00:39:34,055 --> 00:39:39,621
- This hanging? It isn't anyone I
know, is it?
- It's just some rascle the police arrested.

332
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:43,597
- He was impersonating a police office.
- Impersonating?

333
00:39:44,194 --> 00:39:50,953
- He made off with a sack of apples
from the local fruit merchant.
- Hanging is much too good for him.

334
00:39:51,151 --> 00:39:54,531
I realize that His Excellency wants
to continue his journey as soon as possible.

335
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:58,109
Yes, I must go immediately. No
receptions.

336
00:39:58,904 --> 00:40:04,073
- Your Excellency I'm broken hearted.
- I was looking forward to you
inspecting our little village. It's a
wonderful village. Finest village I've

337
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:08,049
- Would you be kind enough to say
so in your offical report?
- Yes of course, but I must get dressed.

338
00:40:08,446 --> 00:40:13,019
Of course. Assemble the villagers
and band to speed His Excellency
on his way.

339
00:40:13,416 --> 00:40:16,398
- Where are my clothes?
- Kovach! The uniform.

340
00:40:17,591 --> 00:40:20,970
- Well it's badly stained, I was
having it cleaned.
- Well then a fresh uniform for His Excellency.

341
00:40:21,368 --> 00:40:25,145
- Where will I get one for His Excellency?
- Yours will do.

342
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:29,717
- This is brand new, this wouldn't fit
His Excellency.
- Izzy, Gizzy, take care of this.

343
00:40:30,115 --> 00:40:35,283
They are tailors Your Excellency.
They will retify that. A new uniform
for His Excellency in a half an hour.

344
00:42:38,534 --> 00:42:44,299
Even in the short time you've been
here, you've captured the hearts of
our people. A pity you have to leave.

345
00:42:44,498 --> 00:42:50,661
-I thought I might be coming back
again soon.
- Don't change your plans on our account.

346
00:42:51,058 --> 00:42:55,432
Quick, His Excellency's horse.
The Inspector General's horse.

347
00:42:58,612 --> 00:43:03,185
- I'll send the horse back as soon as possible.
- No, no keep it. Help His
Excellency to mount.

348
00:43:10,938 --> 00:43:13,919
Oh Your Excellency, great star of
wisdom.

349
00:43:15,311 --> 00:43:19,883
Exhaulted one, do not be angry with
your devoted servants. I've hunted
for you everywhere.

350
00:43:20,082 --> 00:43:24,058
Forgive me great master. Forgive
me. Show mercy on your unworthy servant.

351
00:43:24,257 --> 00:43:29,425
- Forgive me you numbskull, or I'll
break you in half.
- It's all right Yakov.

352
00:43:30,022 --> 00:43:35,190
I am the lowly servant of His Great Lord,
The Inspector General. Due to my
negligence, we were separated on the road.

353
00:43:35,389 --> 00:43:38,172
- I was just leaving.
- I must speak to you first master.

354
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:41,552
The Emporer has sent you
confidential instructions. A secret message.

355
00:43:42,943 --> 00:43:47,714
- But he was just leaving.
- The Inspector General will decide
that for himself.

356
00:43:52,684 --> 00:43:56,859
What are you doing? Yakov, I'll
never be able to get out.

357
00:44:02,226 --> 00:44:06,599
- Yakov why did you stop me? I had a
chance to get away and now they may
hang me. - Be quiet you idiot.

358
00:44:06,798 --> 00:44:11,172
Why should they hang The
Inspector General. They lay the
whole town at your feet.

359
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:15,346
- I've got everything I want.
- You've got everything you want?
What have you got?

360
00:44:15,744 --> 00:44:19,720
I didn't let anything slip through my
fingers. What have you got? See!

361
00:44:20,117 --> 00:44:23,695
Three spoons? And these fat
thieves are loaded with gold.

362
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:26,876
But you don't understand. We can
sell the spoons, buy a new wagon
and leave this town.

363
00:44:27,274 --> 00:44:33,237
Go on run away. I was right in the
first place. You haven't got an
honest bone in your body.

364
00:44:35,822 --> 00:44:39,798
Wait a minute Yakov. A few days
ago you kicked me out because you
said I wasn't a good thief.

365
00:44:40,195 --> 00:44:45,761
I kicked you out? I do everything
for you and this is the thanks I get?

366
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,737
For once in your miserable life you
have a chance to do something really good.

367
00:44:49,936 --> 00:44:54,508
What happens? You want to run
like a rabbit.

368
00:44:54,707 --> 00:44:58,484
Never a thought to the people in the
village. Nothing but selfishness.

369
00:44:58,882 --> 00:45:03,056
I crawled through every corner of
this village. Georgi, what misery
exists here.

370
00:45:03,454 --> 00:45:08,424
The Mayor has taxed the very life
out of this town. And not content
with that, they steal.

371
00:45:09,418 --> 00:45:14,586
35,000 crowns they collected from
the little children and their parents
to buy a pipe organ from the church.

372
00:45:14,984 --> 00:45:19,158
And they trump up a cock and bull
story that the organ was destroyed
and that they sold it in another town.

373
00:45:20,351 --> 00:45:23,731
By tonight we can make them pay
35,000 crowns for protection.

374
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:27,905
Then I buy back the organ, you
present it to the town and we
expose these rascals.

375
00:45:28,104 --> 00:45:32,080
- May I become a wandering gypsy
if I'm not telling the truth.
- But you are a wandering gypsy.

376
00:45:32,478 --> 00:45:37,845
That proves I'm telling the truth. Now to work
Georgi. The most important thing that you make
them understand is that you know how crooked you are.

377
00:45:38,243 --> 00:45:43,610
- They'll shower you with gold.
- 35,000 crowsn Yakov, do you think
they'll give it to me just like that?

378
00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:47,586
They will give you more. It never
fails. They will give you more
because you are The Inspector General.

379
00:45:47,983 --> 00:45:51,363
- I don't know how to be an Inspector General.
- That's very simple, you have to
behave like one.

380
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,134
- But how?
- Oh how, why what. Don't bother
me with silly technicalities.

381
00:45:56,333 --> 00:46:00,308
You're The Inspector General. Be
big, strong, fair.

382
00:46:06,471 --> 00:46:11,640
Gentlemen, I have good news for
you. The Inspector General has
decided to remain indefinitely.

383
00:46:13,031 --> 00:46:18,200
He demands an inspection of the
financial affairs of Brodny and he
will meet with you at the town hall at 2 o'clock.

384
00:46:33,904 --> 00:46:39,073
Big big, be strong, be firm says
Yakov. But if it doesn't work, whose
neck will they jerk?

385
00:46:39,272 --> 00:46:43,645
Whose block will they knock off.
Not Yakov.

386
00:46:45,832 --> 00:46:49,211
Be an Inspector General.

387
00:46:51,994 --> 00:46:56,964
What does an Inspector General
do? lnspect Generals?

388
00:46:57,958 --> 00:47:01,735
An Inspector General generally
inspects that is.....

389
00:47:02,133 --> 00:47:06,904
they expect them to inspect
generally. If they're expecting a
General Inspector.

390
00:47:07,301 --> 00:47:14,458
But an exceptionally generous Inspector General
who made an exception and had no inspection
would cause suspision and in my
condition I couldn't accept. Thank

391
00:47:16,048 --> 00:47:22,608
However If people aren't suspecting now
accept without detecting an imposter who's
not posted as a pedigree inspector.

392
00:47:23,404 --> 00:47:28,175
Could this pabable imposter say a
gypsy or acoster could possibly get
past them by his posture?

393
00:47:28,771 --> 00:47:31,554
In two words-unlikely.

394
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:45,271
So it is not a question to fl ee or not
to flee, but to be or not to be.

395
00:47:46,265 --> 00:47:49,644
And if so, how?

396
00:47:51,632 --> 00:47:56,999
Should I be arrogant? Should I be
elegant? Should I be smart?

397
00:47:58,789 --> 00:48:02,168
A rolling Russian Czar, or very
British impar

398
00:48:02,566 --> 00:48:07,933
Or like the KGV in Nice who already
eats the cheese while he says "No
thank-you please".

399
00:48:08,331 --> 00:48:10,915
Very smart.

400
00:48:11,313 --> 00:48:18,071
I must examine every side of me.
The long, the narrow , the wide of me.

401
00:48:18,469 --> 00:48:24,234
The Dr. Jekyll and Hide of me.

402
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:31,987
If I value my anatomy, the skinny
and the pal of me, how shall I start
to play the part?

403
00:48:39,143 --> 00:48:41,131
Should I be arrogant?

404
00:48:41,529 --> 00:48:45,306
Up off your knees. Stop licking my boots.

405
00:48:45,704 --> 00:48:46,896
Elegant?

406
00:48:47,095 --> 00:48:48,884
Sugar?

407
00:48:49,282 --> 00:48:50,872
A lump more.

408
00:48:52,065 --> 00:48:55,047
-Lemon?

409
00:48:56,438 --> 00:48:59,619
- Cream?
- A dribble.

410
00:49:01,806 --> 00:49:04,986
- Tea?
- Never touch it.

411
00:49:06,577 --> 00:49:08,366
Or smart?

412
00:49:08,763 --> 00:49:12,739
If they don't know what they should
know, they don't know what you know.

413
00:49:13,137 --> 00:49:16,119
Arrogant, elegant, smart.

414
00:49:16,516 --> 00:49:17,709
If you say so.

415
00:49:18,107 --> 00:49:20,691
And it's not so! So what?!

416
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:25,064
If you talk to them pa-pa-pa, you
only waste your breathe.

417
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:29,438
Laught at them they're all you
probably need.

418
00:49:29,835 --> 00:49:34,805
Talk and you show your ignorance,
laugh and you show your teeth.

419
00:49:39,377 --> 00:49:46,534
Gentlemen, if you would just step aside
for one moment, I should be very happy
to talk to this unfortunate wretch.

420
00:49:51,901 --> 00:49:58,064
The course of action you should act
on that'd actually planned is a
smasher. A lot of thought I put in it.

421
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:03,431
If you casually cover up your mouth
with your hand,

422
00:50:04,226 --> 00:50:07,208
You will never put your foot in it.

423
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:12,973
Really gentlemen, please.

424
00:50:17,546 --> 00:50:20,130
Sneak a sniff in of snuff.

425
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:25,497
And so have you no more disease.

426
00:50:25,696 --> 00:50:29,473
Just stand around and wait for them
to sneeze.

427
00:50:43,389 --> 00:50:46,370
And you'll see which way will blow
the breeze.

428
00:50:47,364 --> 00:50:53,328
Pay no attention to what he tells.
Do it my way.

429
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:10,410
Stooooop! Please stop!

430
00:51:10,807 --> 00:51:13,789
You're confusing me, please stop,
please stop.

431
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:18,163
Please say no more.

432
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:22,139
You're so pleased with yourselves.

433
00:51:22,735 --> 00:51:25,916
You don't care about me.

434
00:51:27,307 --> 00:51:30,488
This isn't true.

435
00:51:31,681 --> 00:51:41,620
If we didn't care, would we talk this way?

436
00:51:41,819 --> 00:51:45,000
Things are not as bad as they look.

437
00:51:45,596 --> 00:51:49,969
No sir, they are much worse.

438
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:55,536
And remember an ear in the eye is
worth two in the bush.

439
00:51:57,524 --> 00:52:02,096
Then how do I play my roll.

440
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:13,825
With you I agree with me, you need
no longer linger.

441
00:52:14,421 --> 00:52:16,806
I'll give them the fist.

442
00:52:17,204 --> 00:52:18,993
Give them the wrist.

443
00:52:19,192 --> 00:52:23,764
Give them the finger.

444
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:44,836
To the Town Hall.

445
00:53:22,805 --> 00:53:25,589
You'll find everything in order, Your
Excellency.

446
00:53:49,444 --> 00:53:53,022
- Just a moment! What was that?
-What was what?

447
00:53:53,419 --> 00:53:56,004
I thought I saw something.

448
00:54:00,576 --> 00:54:02,961
How do you account for this?

449
00:54:09,323 --> 00:54:13,895
- There were no taxes that day, Your Excellency.
- If you put your official signature to
the books, Your Excellency.

450
00:54:16,281 --> 00:54:20,654
- What is this?
- It's the very best we have Your
Excellency. We're not a very rich community.

451
00:54:48,684 --> 00:54:53,057
I think I'd better not sign this, until I've...

452
00:54:54,647 --> 00:54:59,418
- Until you've examined the books
more closely at the house Your Excellency.
- Yes and excellent idea.

453
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:09,159
We shall see, what we shall see.

454
00:55:13,135 --> 00:55:17,906
And all I saw was this gypsy show.
The fat gypsy was selling this stuf
and his partner....

455
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,683
had his head on a plate.

456
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:34,207
- Who is that man?
- That His Excellency, The Inspector General.

457
00:55:37,388 --> 00:55:39,773
Military Training Quarters.

458
00:59:35,386 --> 00:59:38,567
Dear Yakov.

459
00:59:40,555 --> 00:59:48,506
I can not stay any longer.

460
00:59:49,699 --> 00:59:53,675
Love Georgi.

461
01:00:12,163 --> 01:00:17,729
This is the kitchen isn't it? Well
you go right ahead, I'm just inspecting.

462
01:00:31,446 --> 01:00:33,831
Fine, just fine.

463
01:00:35,024 --> 01:00:37,012
- Now tell me, is there another way out?
- Out?!

464
01:00:37,807 --> 01:00:41,186
- Out out.
- Oh you're not leaving Your Excellency.

465
01:00:41,584 --> 01:00:46,753
I can't stay another minute. There's
another town I have to inspect.

466
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:50,331
- People are waiting. How do I get out.
- I can't believe it.

467
01:00:50,728 --> 01:00:54,505
- Can't believe what? You can't
believe I have another town to inspect.
- Of course I do Your Highness.

468
01:00:55,499 --> 01:01:00,668
Please don't be angry with me. I
wasn't angry. You were so kind to
me last night. I thought you would stay.

469
01:01:01,066 --> 01:01:04,843
And it gave me new hope. Why the
whole village is looking to you for help.

470
01:01:05,638 --> 01:01:10,011
- Yes, well I thought perhaps on my way back.
- Oh Your Excellency such
plundering and misery.

471
01:01:10,409 --> 01:01:15,379
It's terrible. But you should see this
other town. They need me very badly.

472
01:01:15,776 --> 01:01:19,553
- People are waiting and receptions.
- I see.

473
01:01:21,342 --> 01:01:23,927
I really mustn't disappoint them.

474
01:01:25,716 --> 01:01:28,300
Well, I'd better be going.

475
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:39,433
-I'm sorry you won't be more friendly.
- Friendly? Why should I be friendly?

476
01:01:40,228 --> 01:01:44,402
I don't care if I hang for what I say I
think. You're as bad as the rest of them.

477
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,981
Worse, because you have the
power to do good and you run away.

478
01:01:48,577 --> 01:01:52,354
I'll stay. I can get the organ back. lt
didn't burn, I know where it is.

479
01:01:52,752 --> 01:01:55,733
- Then you do care about the people.
- Of course I do.

480
01:01:56,131 --> 01:01:59,709
- The whole town will be so happy.
-I want you to be happy Lizzy.

481
01:02:00,504 --> 01:02:04,679
I don't count Your Excellency. I'm
just a kitchenmaid and I'll always be one.

482
01:02:05,275 --> 01:02:09,649
But that's no way to look at life.
Things can change over night.

483
01:02:10,245 --> 01:02:13,426
After all I wasn't born an Inspector
General.

484
01:02:14,619 --> 01:02:18,197
It just happened. Come on smile.

485
01:02:31,317 --> 01:02:38,871
Reach for the moon and look for the
golden rainbow.

486
01:02:39,468 --> 01:02:44,040
You will find happy times.

487
01:02:46,227 --> 01:02:53,383
You'll hear a tune, that lives in the
heart of a bluebird.

488
01:02:54,377 --> 01:02:58,552
And you'll find happy times.

489
01:03:00,142 --> 01:03:06,106
Thought things look very dark, your
dream is not in vain.

490
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:13,660
For when do you fi nd a rainbow?
Only after rain.

491
01:03:14,654 --> 01:03:21,810
So wish on the moon, and
someday, it may be tomorrow..

492
01:03:23,003 --> 01:03:28,172
You will suddenly hear chimes

493
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:39,901
And you'll find your happy, happy times.

494
01:03:41,093 --> 01:03:44,075
Latus, Bela, see to the carriage.

495
01:03:45,069 --> 01:03:50,039
Where is everybody? Oh Your Excellency.

496
01:03:51,629 --> 01:03:52,623
Just look what I found in the Brodny
library. It's the new almanac of The
Emporer's official staff.

497
01:03:57,991 --> 01:04:03,756
- Emporer's official staff?
- Both histories of their families and
portraits of their celebrated families.

498
01:04:04,551 --> 01:04:08,725
The portraits are very bad, very
bad. You wouldn't recognize the one of me.

499
01:04:09,123 --> 01:04:14,292
-And it's terrible.
-I thought women were only vain
about their portraits.

500
01:04:14,689 --> 01:04:20,057
Now I've got to see how bad they've
made you look. You know you've
never even told me your name.

501
01:04:20,852 --> 01:04:26,219
Doesn't matter. I'll soon recognize
you and find out all about you and
your beautiful wife and lovely children.

502
01:04:26,617 --> 01:04:31,388
I have no wife. None of my familiy
had wives. My father didn't like wives.

503
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:36,358
I mean my mother didn't like my
father's wife. May I have this book?

504
01:04:36,755 --> 01:04:40,135
This looks a lot like you, but older of
course. A relative of yours?

505
01:04:40,532 --> 01:04:43,514
- This is my father. Your father?
- Madame Knabe?

506
01:04:43,912 --> 01:04:48,484
Married with Peter Knabe, 46 years
old and mother of 12 boys.

507
01:04:48,881 --> 01:04:53,255
That was a disguise. My father was
a spy in the war.

508
01:04:53,652 --> 01:04:57,628
He always used to disguise himself
as my mother.

509
01:04:58,225 --> 01:05:02,996
- I was 19 before I could tell them apart.
- Knabe, is that your family name?

510
01:05:03,393 --> 01:05:08,761
- Yes, Farple Knabe.
- Farple, what an unusual name.

511
01:05:09,158 --> 01:05:13,929
Sounds like a morning breeze,
rustling through the leaves of the willows.

512
01:05:14,526 --> 01:05:17,110
What does it mean?

513
01:05:20,688 --> 01:05:23,471
Some kind of soup, I think.

514
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:30,628
-Where were you born?
- Well let me have the book and I'll
tell you all about it.

515
01:05:31,224 --> 01:05:36,592
- Some night when we're alone,
perhaps tonight.
- I want to hear everything Farple.

516
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:41,363
You don't know how I yearn to live.
What it means to be married to a
man who doesn't understand.

517
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,742
He's a peasant, a course,
uncultured, a pig.

518
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:48,718
I was forced to marry him. I'm an
attractive woman, am I not?

519
01:05:49,116 --> 01:05:53,489
I'm still in the first bloom of my
youth, am I not?

520
01:05:53,688 --> 01:05:58,658
Could a man wish for a more lovely,
intelligent, responsive woman than I am?

521
01:05:58,856 --> 01:06:03,826
- No!
- Oh Farple, you say the most beautiful things.

522
01:06:04,423 --> 01:06:07,007
I really must be going.

523
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:13,965
- You will help me Farple, won't you?
- Promise! I promise.

524
01:06:14,362 --> 01:06:18,537
When we get to Paris, I won't be a
burden for you. I swear.

525
01:06:28,675 --> 01:06:32,452
- Forgive me. May I have a word
with Your Excellency?
- What do you want?

526
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:36,826
I throw myself on your mercy.
Please Your Excellency, for the
sake of my family.

527
01:06:37,223 --> 01:06:40,603
-What is it? What have you done?
- The tax records, it wasn't my idea
to falsify them.

528
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,380
It was the Mayor, my own uncle and Toleki.

529
01:06:44,777 --> 01:06:50,542
I admit I take bribes, but what kind
of bribes? Puppy dogs, just puppy dogs.

530
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:54,518
- I like puppy dogs.
-You can have them. Oh forgive me.

531
01:06:54,916 --> 01:06:59,090
All 60 of them. And here's a little
gift just to show you how much....

532
01:07:00,879 --> 01:07:04,259
- Who is it?
- It is I, Toleki, superintendant of the school.

533
01:07:04,657 --> 01:07:09,030
- He mustn't find me here.
- Oh he's just a member of the council.

534
01:07:11,415 --> 01:07:13,403
Come in.

535
01:07:14,397 --> 01:07:17,777
Your Excellency, may I have a
moment of your time. I have
something that may interest you, look.

536
01:07:19,566 --> 01:07:23,741
I have the best interest without a
stain on my heart, or I would never
tell you this.

537
01:07:23,939 --> 01:07:27,319
- Come to the point Tacky.
- Toleki.

538
01:07:27,518 --> 01:07:34,277
Sometimes a man must decide between duty
and friends and I feel it is my duty to advise
you of the corruption in the city of Brodny.

539
01:07:34,674 --> 01:07:39,048
This isn't much, but if you will just
accept it as a loan.

540
01:07:40,042 --> 01:07:43,222
May I see you a moment Your
Excellency. It's Gizzy the postmaster.

541
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:45,807
Gizzy! He may not find me here.

542
01:07:55,349 --> 01:07:57,734
Come in.

543
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:04,294
I'm a poor man Your Excellency.
Please accept this, this is all I have.

544
01:08:04,692 --> 01:08:07,766
The temptation was too strong. The
others stole more than I did.

545
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:11,569
- Who is that?
- Come with me, you have to hide.
Get in the closet here.

546
01:08:16,539 --> 01:08:19,521
- Come in.
- Oh Inspector General. Yes?

547
01:08:20,117 --> 01:08:25,882
I must speak to you. My uniform
looks very nice on you.

548
01:08:26,478 --> 01:08:31,249
- I'm having one made in black, with
silver across here.
- What is it Kovach?

549
01:08:32,045 --> 01:08:36,219
- I may as well make a clean breast of it.
- Won't you sit down?

550
01:08:36,617 --> 01:08:40,593
You see it wasn't for me. It was for
my wife. My wife is not a contented woman.

551
01:08:40,791 --> 01:08:45,960
She wants clothing and money and jewels.
I'd give my 6 kids to get rid of my wife.

552
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:50,930
- There's only 1 000 crowns here.
- A 1 000 crowns?

553
01:08:52,123 --> 01:08:55,900
- If you just give me a chance to sell the jewels.
- Won't you sit down?

554
01:09:03,255 --> 01:09:05,641
In the bed!

555
01:09:09,418 --> 01:09:11,803
Come in.

556
01:09:13,393 --> 01:09:18,761
- Your Excellency.
- I thought I just put you in the closet?

557
01:09:28,899 --> 01:09:31,086
Come in.

558
01:09:34,068 --> 01:09:39,038
- I didn't know you were resting Your Excellency.
- I always rest, the doctor said it's
good for my liver.

559
01:09:40,032 --> 01:09:42,815
- Maybe I'd better come back?
- No, it's all right. What do you want?

560
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:45,995
- I just wanted to make a confession.
- I'll take it. Thank-you.

561
01:09:46,393 --> 01:09:51,959
I'm as guilty as the rest of the
others. Oh, I mustn't be found here,
where do I hide? On the bed! No!

562
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:59,712
On top of the bed.

563
01:10:05,676 --> 01:10:08,061
Come in.

564
01:10:09,055 --> 01:10:13,031
- You don't have to put on any act for me.
- Has the message come yet from
The Emporer?

565
01:10:13,429 --> 01:10:17,007
-Go downstairs and see if my
luggage has arrived.
- What's the matter with you?

566
01:10:17,405 --> 01:10:19,989
What's the weather outside like?

567
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:26,151
There's a lot of men hiding in there.
The councilmen came with a lot of bribes.

568
01:10:26,549 --> 01:10:28,934
Bribes? Money?

569
01:10:31,718 --> 01:10:34,302
Where is it?

570
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:40,067
Why? Come in.

571
01:10:42,254 --> 01:10:46,826
Your Excellency, may I speak with
you for a moment? Privately.

572
01:10:57,759 --> 01:11:02,332
- They all brougth him money.
- Gentlemen, I'm going to ask you
to leave the room.

573
01:11:04,329 --> 01:11:09,697
Oh Mayor and you too Chief of
Police. His Highness can not
tolerate dishonesty.

574
01:11:10,094 --> 01:11:15,661
-Then why did he accept the bribes?
- His Excellency has many private charities.

575
01:11:16,058 --> 01:11:20,829
I can assure you that not a penny of
that money will ever find its way into
the pockets of The Inspector General.

576
01:11:21,823 --> 01:11:24,010
What do you want us to do?

577
01:11:24,407 --> 01:11:30,769
It's possible that a few contributions
from you might....

578
01:11:31,564 --> 01:11:34,745
-How much?
- Shall we say 100,000 crowns?

579
01:11:36,335 --> 01:11:39,913
- 100,000 crowns!
- I'll be a pauper. Well keep your money.

580
01:11:40,311 --> 01:11:43,492
You can jingle it in your pockets all
the way up the steps of the gallows.

581
01:11:43,889 --> 01:11:46,672
- He wouldn't do anything like that.
- He would, and he has.

582
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:52,238
But he might be inclined to show
lieniency if he can realize the
charitable dream of his life.

583
01:11:52,636 --> 01:11:56,214
A much needed addition of the
Catherdral he built in Vienna.

584
01:11:56,612 --> 01:12:00,389
A new church organ. A fire-proof organ.

585
01:12:01,184 --> 01:12:05,756
- Fire-proof!
- He knows. He knows.

586
01:12:17,087 --> 01:12:20,666
- We can get rid of him without
leaving a trace and none of us will
be involved. - Who will do it?

587
01:12:21,063 --> 01:12:26,033
Vetalo, the woodchopper. You do
as I tell him, he has to.

588
01:12:26,431 --> 01:12:29,810
I can get him tonight, during the
reception and confusion and noise.

589
01:12:30,208 --> 01:12:33,985
- But if something goes wrong.
- Nothing will go wrong. Are you sure?

590
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:39,949
After midnight, as soon as everybody has
had plenty to drink, we'll get him into the
barn where Vetalo the woodchopper is waiting.

591
01:12:40,744 --> 01:12:43,129
He will dispose of the body.

592
01:13:08,964 --> 01:13:12,144
- What are you doing?
- What, you think I want to steal it?
I want to count it.

593
01:13:12,542 --> 01:13:16,717
- I already counted it. You can't count.
- Well, it's very heavy so there must
be enough here to buy back the organ.

594
01:13:17,114 --> 01:13:20,494
- Right, you give it to me and I'll go
get the organ.
- Oh no, not without me!

595
01:13:20,891 --> 01:13:24,271
- You can't leave here. They need
you for the reception.
- Well then we'll go after the reception.

596
01:13:24,668 --> 01:13:28,843
There's an old Hungarian proverb:
Trust everybody but keep the organ
money in sight.

597
01:13:32,819 --> 01:13:35,006
Come in.

598
01:14:05,818 --> 01:14:08,005
- What is that?
- It's just a letter.

599
01:14:08,403 --> 01:14:11,782
- What kind of letter?
- Well a love letter I suppose.

600
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:14,764
No Yakov, it's private.

601
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:19,336
Yakov you might tear it.

602
01:14:22,119 --> 01:14:24,107
Well?

603
01:14:28,083 --> 01:14:30,667
Would you read it for me Yakov?

604
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:44,286
- Oh Georgi, you are such a lucky guy.
- What is it?

605
01:14:44,683 --> 01:14:49,057
- That a beautiful girl like that would
fall in love with you.
- Read it to me Yakov.

606
01:14:49,454 --> 01:14:54,822
My dearest darling Inspector
General. From the moment I fi rst
saw you, I knew you were the one.

607
01:14:55,219 --> 01:15:01,978
At night I dream of your manly figure,
and your handsome gentle features
drive me mad with passionate love.

608
01:15:02,575 --> 01:15:09,135
The sound of your voice thrills me
beyond words, and if I can not have
you for my very own, I will surely die.

609
01:15:11,918 --> 01:15:18,279
-Is there any more? Does she say anything else?
- Yes, P.S., please meet me in the
barn at midnight.

610
01:15:19,074 --> 01:15:22,255
Please meet me in the barn at midnight...

611
01:15:24,839 --> 01:15:27,026
Yakov, what does P.S. mean?

612
01:15:30,207 --> 01:15:36,369
- Please Sweetheart.
- Please sweetheart meet me in the
barn at midnight.

613
01:15:56,248 --> 01:15:59,429
- I have the carriage waiting Farple.
- The carriage?

614
01:15:59,827 --> 01:16:04,200
My things are all packed. I'll meet
you at the stable after the dance.

615
01:16:07,634 --> 01:16:10,019
Cousin Byro....

616
01:16:20,754 --> 01:16:25,326
I have the money. Has he sent in his report?
Then I'll deliver them to him tonight.

617
01:16:25,724 --> 01:16:29,103
We can't settle the matter in here.
Where would you suggest?
Outside, in the barn.

618
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:32,681
At midnight? At midnight! He'll be there.

619
01:16:37,651 --> 01:16:40,832
I'll go and get ready. I'll see you
later Farple.

620
01:16:53,171 --> 01:16:56,551
I got your note. You're wonderful
At the barn?

621
01:17:04,502 --> 01:17:06,291
Thank-you.

622
01:17:17,621 --> 01:17:23,784
Out of my way. I am Colonel Franz
Castine. Comrade, life-long friend
of The Inspector General.

623
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:28,555
We were friends for many, many
years. Announce me at once young lady.

624
01:17:28,952 --> 01:17:32,133
- Yes Colonel.
- Oh...young man.

625
01:17:32,531 --> 01:17:37,898
- Problem with the eyes are there Colonel?
- Yes, I was snow-blinded in the Alps with the
Italian campaign with His Majesty, The Emporer.

626
01:17:38,892 --> 01:17:42,073
The Emporer! Long life to The
Emporer.

627
01:17:43,067 --> 01:17:47,639
You idiot! You blithering idiot! Now
where are my glasses?

628
01:17:48,036 --> 01:17:51,615
I am so blind without my glasses.

629
01:17:52,807 --> 01:17:54,994
Now don't step on them.

630
01:17:55,789 --> 01:17:58,970
- Oh, I am so sorry.
- You stupid fool!

631
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:05,530
- I'll have to go and get another pair.
- No, no now you just stay right there.

632
01:18:06,127 --> 01:18:13,482
Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honor to
announce the unexpected arrival of Colonel
Franz Castine of The Emporer's Royal Guard.

633
01:18:14,078 --> 01:18:18,849
Comrade in arms and life-long
friend of Your Excellency, The
Inspector General.

634
01:18:25,608 --> 01:18:30,578
The Colonel is quite near-sighted and has
had the misfortune of breaking his glasses.
Imagine, he broke his glasses.

635
01:18:30,976 --> 01:18:34,753
Oh no Colonel, you're kissing the
wrong man. This is The Inspector General.

636
01:18:34,951 --> 01:18:39,126
Oh yes of course. How stupid of
me. The Inspector General is really
a much shorter man.

637
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:45,686
Leopold, this is indeed a joy, a joy.
I noticed that you shaved your moustache.

638
01:18:46,481 --> 01:18:52,445
- It used to tickle, not me that is.
-It's all right, it's makes you look much younger.

639
01:18:53,042 --> 01:18:58,011
- Your voice seems to sound more youthful
- I've had laryngitis.

640
01:18:58,409 --> 01:19:03,776
This is the man, who single-
handed, routed an entire regiment
of the ltalians at the battle of Lavengretto.

641
01:19:04,174 --> 01:19:09,342
And then he pushed their own cannon into
position and fired at the retreating enemy.
Do you remember that my boy?

642
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:12,324
And Austerlitz?

643
01:19:12,722 --> 01:19:16,897
He just dove into a raging river and
rescued 4 wounded soldiers.

644
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:20,872
And then on the way, he cut down
10 Spaniards with his sabre.

645
01:19:21,866 --> 01:19:28,228
Morale was very low, but with his
magnificent courage he plunged
into the fray and led his men with a song.

646
01:19:28,625 --> 01:19:33,794
The victory song of the 94th
regiment. Onward, onward never
looking back.

647
01:19:34,589 --> 01:19:38,565
- How does it go Leopold?
- He doesn't like to be reminded of
that tragic day.

648
01:19:38,963 --> 01:19:42,740
- But he might be persuaded to sing
something a little lighter, gay.
- In a little while.

649
01:19:43,336 --> 01:19:49,499
- Oh splendid, then I can get my glasses from
the inn. - Why don't you sing something
now and honor the Colonel?

650
01:19:49,896 --> 01:19:53,276
Sing something before he gets his
glasses.

651
01:19:56,854 --> 01:20:00,034
Could I borrow your drink for this
song?

652
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:08,894
AND NOW.....and now for my friend
and comrade in arms I

653
01:20:09,292 --> 01:20:13,864
would like to do a gypsy drinking
song.

654
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:20,822
- My wine, he took my wine.
- There's plenty more.

655
01:20:21,219 --> 01:20:24,201
- Why are you trembling for?
- The wine is deadly poison.

656
01:20:24,599 --> 01:20:29,569
Is it? You did it? How very
thoughtful of you. Why I misjudged
you all these years.

657
01:20:30,364 --> 01:20:35,930
No it was for me. For you? Yes, I
couldn't stand it any longer and I
even wrote a confession.

658
01:20:56,008 --> 01:21:00,978
Whisky drew the whispering woods
on a wild Romany pony...

659
01:21:01,375 --> 01:21:04,357
ride the gypsy.

660
01:21:11,911 --> 01:21:16,285
The world thinks him tipsy and
careless and free....

661
01:21:17,875 --> 01:21:21,652
But oh the poor gypsy....

662
01:21:26,026 --> 01:21:31,989
his lot is not, what a heart should
be.

663
01:21:32,586 --> 01:21:37,953
night and day and day and night
there's a man with a whip....

664
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:51,670
in his hand, over gypsy he stands
and this is what he says....

665
01:22:01,013 --> 01:22:06,380
Crawl gypsy, sing gypsy, dance
gypsy, laugh gypsy.....

666
01:22:06,778 --> 01:22:09,959
cry gypsy, live gypsy, die gypsy.
Drink!

667
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:21,290
Drink to good-byes and drink to
hellos.

668
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:28,446
Drink you alone with thine eyes and
I will drink with my nose.

669
01:22:29,639 --> 01:22:32,223
And so he drinks!

670
01:22:34,211 --> 01:22:36,796
But first we sing.

671
01:22:40,771 --> 01:22:45,344
How can you sing gypsy song without gypsy
chorus? Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you a
little favor and we have a chorus.

672
01:22:45,741 --> 01:22:51,705
It will sound beautiful, wonderful.
I will give you a little "b". All right?

673
01:22:53,892 --> 01:22:58,663
Very nice, but we get a little
sharper, a little more nose.

674
01:23:03,434 --> 01:23:07,608
Very nice, now short huh? I like it.

675
01:23:08,006 --> 01:23:11,584
Once more please. Very pretty.

676
01:23:11,982 --> 01:23:16,952
This group here, I will make for you
stock, stock. Please? Everybody
understand, stock, stock.

677
01:23:18,542 --> 01:23:22,518
Very nice.
NO I DIDN'T MAKE IT YET!

678
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:28,283
Please, I didn't make it yet. Small
stock, stock. Very nice.

679
01:23:30,668 --> 01:23:34,445
Loud. I'll be with you in two
minutes.

680
01:23:35,042 --> 01:23:40,011
This little group here, I would like
you to make me a favor with all
your sweet gentle little faces.

681
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:43,788
Make for me ha, ha, ha. This way,
all right, please everybody.

682
01:23:45,975 --> 01:23:50,349
Wonderful. Now everybody please
once again.

683
01:23:51,343 --> 01:23:54,921
Very pretty. I love you to pieces.
Please

684
01:24:39,649 --> 01:24:43,625
- Want something to drink, maybe?
- No thank-you Excellency.

685
01:24:56,546 --> 01:24:59,131
And so we drink.

686
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:03,107
But first we play.

687
01:25:25,597 --> 01:25:30,169
Pardon me, I slipped my bow. My
fingers need a reason.

688
01:26:14,185 --> 01:26:16,371
I like it.

689
01:26:17,167 --> 01:26:19,751
Makes me cry.

690
01:26:35,257 --> 01:26:36,847
Who me?

691
01:26:50,166 --> 01:26:52,750
And so we drink.

692
01:26:54,341 --> 01:26:56,925
But first we dance.

693
01:27:03,883 --> 01:27:05,473
Pardon me.

694
01:27:45,033 --> 01:27:52,388
And so we drink to eveything we
love.

695
01:27:56,761 --> 01:28:02,129
To everyone we admire.

696
01:28:09,015 --> 01:28:18,358
To the girl who sets your heart a
glow, and sets your heart on fire.

697
01:28:29,491 --> 01:28:36,846
And so we drink.

698
01:28:42,412 --> 01:28:44,400
I like it.

699
01:29:09,647 --> 01:29:12,231
Will you excuse me ladies, I have
something...

700
01:29:12,827 --> 01:29:20,183
- I beg your pardon Your Excellency.
- I hope you are enjoying the
evening. Yes, I ah, very much.

701
01:29:56,959 --> 01:29:58,748
Lisa?

702
01:30:06,104 --> 01:30:10,477
Why you clumsy ox. What's the
matter with you, are you crazy?
You could have killed me with that.

703
01:30:13,061 --> 01:30:18,826
Why do you have to work so late at
night, anyway? Whatever you
have to chop can wait til morning can't it?

704
01:30:19,423 --> 01:30:23,200
Now go on to bed. I have to meet
someone here. Go on.

705
01:30:25,585 --> 01:30:30,356
- Aren't you The Inspector General?
- Yeah. That doesn't mean I can't
meet anybody here, does it?

706
01:30:30,754 --> 01:30:33,935
- No?
- You don't believe it do you?

707
01:30:36,519 --> 01:30:41,091
-Read that!
- "Don't go near the barn."

708
01:30:42,284 --> 01:30:46,061
- "They're going to kill you."
- Yeah, and only two hours ago she....

709
01:30:51,229 --> 01:30:54,211
Would you read that again please.

710
01:30:54,609 --> 01:30:59,976
It says, "Don't go near the barn,
they're going to kill you."

711
01:31:04,914 --> 01:31:08,890
Yakov.....My best friend.

712
01:31:24,993 --> 01:31:27,776
- Where's your master?
- My master?

713
01:31:37,914 --> 01:31:41,095
-How did it?
- You know how.

714
01:31:41,492 --> 01:31:47,257
Now gentlemen, let's get down to business.
For a price, I'll get rid of the evidence.

715
01:31:48,450 --> 01:31:51,034
The money.

716
01:31:56,402 --> 01:32:00,179
- I don't think I want any supper.
-Oh no.

717
01:33:21,122 --> 01:33:25,097
- What are you doing Yakov?
Where are you going?
- Get away from me.

718
01:33:43,983 --> 01:33:46,169
Georgi, I'm your best friend.

719
01:33:52,332 --> 01:33:54,916
- Where are we going?
- To get the organ.

720
01:33:56,308 --> 01:33:59,687
Make way for The Inspector
General.

721
01:34:01,874 --> 01:34:04,259
Make way for The Inspector
General!

722
01:34:05,452 --> 01:34:08,633
- What did he say?
- It must have been an eccho.

723
01:34:13,006 --> 01:34:17,181
Attention! Announcing the
Emissary of The Emporer.

724
01:34:17,777 --> 01:34:22,151
General Leopold Nikolai Tarantino, His
Excellency, The Inspector General.

725
01:34:44,018 --> 01:34:48,789
He took bribes, he drank all my
wine, he yelled out the window , he
even made love to my wife.

726
01:34:49,186 --> 01:34:54,753
How could I doubt that he was The
Inspector General. I mean, he gave us no
chance to think of deception Your Majesty.

727
01:34:55,945 --> 01:35:00,716
- Isn't that right Gizzy? Izzy, he's Gizzy.
- You can always tell by the
strawberry mark on my leg.

728
01:35:00,915 --> 01:35:03,698
Why it's as big as a....

729
01:35:09,264 --> 01:35:13,638
- I'm Gizzy, he's Izzy.
- Silence! Excuse us Your Excellency.

730
01:35:14,035 --> 01:35:18,608
Well Mayor, I want that tramp.
Send out every man available.

731
01:35:19,204 --> 01:35:22,782
Meanwhile, I will write out an order
for his excecution.

732
01:35:23,379 --> 01:35:27,156
He'll hang today Your Excellency, l
promise you that. Test the gallows.

733
01:35:27,553 --> 01:35:30,734
- I'm Izzy, then he is....
- SILENCE!

734
01:35:38,818 --> 01:35:44,185
Citizens, here is the organ. The
one that was stolen. We gave them
money and....

735
01:35:44,782 --> 01:35:48,360
I'll see you in a minute. Here, take
the organ to the church and I'll be
back in a minute.

736
01:35:48,956 --> 01:35:52,734
Come on men, I may need you.
Follow me.

737
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:59,095
Wait here. Ten hut! Oh, never
mind that.

738
01:36:03,468 --> 01:36:07,444
I'm glad I found all of you
gentlemen together. This town is
going to be cleaned up from top to bottom.

739
01:36:07,842 --> 01:36:14,203
- This is The Inspector General. - Yes,
Mr. Mayor, I would like you all to know
that the corruption in this city is at an end.

740
01:36:14,601 --> 01:36:18,577
I want a complete and honest report
from you and a complete and
honest report of your tax records.

741
01:36:18,974 --> 01:36:22,950
And a report from you in the
morning. Who is this man? Tell
him to get out, this is official business.

742
01:36:23,149 --> 01:36:29,311
Mr. Mayor! In the name of The Emporer,
I call upon you to produce all the tax records
and books of this village immediately.

743
01:36:29,709 --> 01:36:33,884
Permit me to interrupt. Let me
show you this communciation which
has just arrived.

744
01:36:46,805 --> 01:36:51,576
- Silly girl. And now to business.
- You filthy bag of bones, this is The
Inspector General.

745
01:36:51,974 --> 01:36:57,341
How do you do? We must have a
long talk together sometime. I want
to look at all these books...

746
01:36:57,739 --> 01:37:00,919
Inspector General?

747
01:37:06,684 --> 01:37:10,064
Open up the cell. Hurry man.
Guards.

748
01:37:11,058 --> 01:37:16,425
Take them away. This is what I.
Two hangings at once.

749
01:37:18,413 --> 01:37:23,780
You'll regret this you fat-faced
villiage idiot! Take your hands off
me you misbegotten peasants.

750
01:37:24,178 --> 01:37:29,148
The Emporer will tear this stinking
village down over your ears.

751
01:37:29,545 --> 01:37:35,509
Heads will roll here like marbles,
and yours first. And this flea-ridden
sack of nothing, you call Inspector General.

752
01:37:35,907 --> 01:37:39,087
This isn't The Inspector General,
don't make me laugh.

753
01:37:39,286 --> 01:37:43,063
The Great Emporer wouldn't
appoint such a thing like this, to a
position so important.

754
01:37:43,461 --> 01:37:48,629
This is your Inspector General here!
His courage, his manner, his
bearing. Gentlemen take your choice.

755
01:37:49,226 --> 01:37:53,798
- I don't know what to think. -You don't
have to think. If this man is The Inspector
General, then were are his credentials?

756
01:37:54,196 --> 01:37:58,569
- Where are yours? Come on show
them, they have a right to see.
- Come on and show them.

757
01:38:02,147 --> 01:38:06,521
Produce them. Here they are, see?

758
01:38:12,484 --> 01:38:15,069
Your Excellency.

759
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:22,822
I would like to take this opportunity
to tender my resignation.

760
01:38:23,418 --> 01:38:27,990
I'm so sorry Your Excellency. It was
our mistake. The imposter will hang!

761
01:38:28,388 --> 01:38:33,159
- This is preposterious!
- If Your Excellency will be so good
to write out the death warrant.

762
01:38:35,942 --> 01:38:39,520
- Arrest that man.
- I'm warning you, I'm warning all of
you. This will be reported to The Emporer.

763
01:38:39,719 --> 01:38:41,707
Lock him up!

764
01:38:47,074 --> 01:38:49,659
- I can't do it.
- Why not?

765
01:38:51,845 --> 01:38:56,219
For one thing, I can't write. I can't
read either.

766
01:38:56,616 --> 01:39:00,791
And even if I could write, I wouldn't
sign his death warrant.

767
01:39:02,779 --> 01:39:07,152
- I'm not The Inspector General.
- He's just soft-hearted, here I'll sign it.

768
01:39:08,146 --> 01:39:14,309
You can't it's all over. I couldn't sign
this. That man is completely innocent.

769
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:20,869
I only did it to get the money to buy
the organ back.

770
01:39:21,267 --> 01:39:24,646
Lock them up, put them in chains,
send them to the gallows. Oh Your
Excellency, I'm so sorry.

771
01:39:25,044 --> 01:39:28,622
Why this has never happened in
Brodny before. I can assure you
that they will go to the gallows, Your Excellency.

772
01:39:29,019 --> 01:39:32,796
-The gallows will wait its turn, but
not now.
- But Your Excellency....

773
01:39:33,194 --> 01:39:35,778
This man will not hang.

774
01:39:36,375 --> 01:39:40,549
This is the first honest man I've met,
since I left Budapest.

775
01:39:42,736 --> 01:39:46,314
- My chain of office Your Excellency.
- We'll put something else around
your neck.

776
01:39:46,712 --> 01:39:50,091
- Thank-you Your Excellency.
- With band music? What did you
say? With band music?

777
01:39:50,887 --> 01:39:52,676
With band music.

778
01:39:54,664 --> 01:39:58,838
I couldn't take this Your Excellency.
I can't even read or write.

779
01:39:59,037 --> 01:40:02,615
- I have no education.
- What you have is much better.

780
01:40:03,013 --> 01:40:05,995
My medal and my sash.

781
01:40:21,103 --> 01:40:27,067
Citizens of Brodny. I have the
honor to present to you, your new Mayor!

782
01:40:28,067 --> 01:40:38,067
