- Oh,just put it right there, please.
- Yes, darling.

457
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,300
Hmm? Oh!
I thought you were--

458
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,400
- On the table, sahib.
- Look what just arrived.

459
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,600
A letter from the publisher
and a check.

460
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,800
It isn't very much,
but it's a check.

461
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,900
- Everything's gonna work out all right.
- What will, darling?

462
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,100
All of it.

463
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,100
Say, what'd old sawbones say?

464
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,900
Nothing frightful?
Didn't pick up a fever?

465
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,200
- No, I--
- What did I tell you?

466
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:24,000
All you need's a change of climate.
We'll go directly to Madrid.

467
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,800
We'll have the bullfights,
the Grecos at del Prado...

468
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,300
then up to Pamplona
in time for the fiesta.

469
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,400
- Harry.
- Luckiest timing in the world.

470
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,300
Darling, couldn't we just go home?

471
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,600
Home?

472
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,800
Where's that?

473
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,000
You mean back to Paris.

474
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:46,100
Well, why?

475
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,400
Just to go home.

476
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,400
Look, darling, we can get
a nice apartment with the check...

477
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,600
with a room for you to work in.

478
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,900
You don't have to go
to Spain, do you?

479
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,900
No, darling, I don't
have to go to Spain...

480
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,200
or anyplace else.

481
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,300
You just want to.

482
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:11,400
Look, Cynthia, if I have to sound
like a lousy stiff that had a mission.

483
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,000
I'm trying to become a writer.

484
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,300
It's a writer's business
to buzz around...

485
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,900
find out about things for himself...

486
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,800
not sit on his can in a comfortable chair
and reach for a bookcase...

487
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,100
for something to crib from.

488
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,200
And after Spain?

489
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,100
How do we know?

490
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:39,300
I mean, you never want
this other normal thing?

491
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,600
I'm trying to explain
what is my normal thing.

492
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,200
- With maybe children?
- Children?

493
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,800
Darling, I want a child
more than anything in the world.

494
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,300
Something of my very own
to hold on to.

495
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,200
Well! Well, sure.
[ Chuckling ]

496
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,900
I love kids, but later.

497
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,300
We've got lots of time.

498
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,600
Look, Cyn, the world is a market...

499
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,100
in which you buy
what you want--

500
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,600
not just with money, but with your time,
with a lot of things.

501
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,300
It's an exchange.
You give something, and you get something.

502
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,400
I'm giving up a piece of my life...

503
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,200
to get something
that I need for my work.

504
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,600
Later on, we can afford what we can afford.
It's as simple as that.

505
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,800
I see.

506
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,100
Can I fix you a drink?

507
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,700
It's a little bit early, isn't it?

508
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,200
It seems to me to be just about
the right time. Do you object?

509
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,500
No.

510
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,700
Look, Cyn, if you have
this yen to go to Paris...

511
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,500
well, you can go there.

512
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,900
Without you?

513
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,800
I'm not saying that I want it.

514
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,200
I'm just saying
that you can go there.

515
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,200
Or if--

516
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,000
If it's a matter
of life and death...

517
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,700
okay, I'll go with you.

518
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,300
I'll go change the tickets.

- How do you do? How is she?

524
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,600
I'm sorry to have to tell you
she lost the child.

- The what?
- You didn't know, Mr. Street?

526
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,300
Exactly what happened?

527
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:45,600
They told me at the hotel that there'd ...
been an accident. That's all.

528
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:50,200
A nasty fall. She'll be quite all right
after a few days' rest.

529
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:54,100
Do you actually mean
you didn't know about the child?

530
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,500
Don't you people talk to each other?

531
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,000
You did it deliberately.

532
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,000
- It was an accident.
- You did it because of what I said.

533
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,500
It was an accident.
I stumbled.

534
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,800
You didn't have any right to do it.

535
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,200
It was my child too, you know.

Darling, you don't want to be childish.
You've read it.

Yes, I ought to forget.

584
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,400

and not drive myself crazy at all
while I wait for you and wait and wait.

Don't you even know you're lying?

- I'm not lying.
- No.

No, it isn't a lie yet.

589
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,600
It won't be a lie until you go away
and discover you're not coming back...

00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:47,700
but are going on and on
and see the whole world...

You know, I think this dancer
likes me very much.

00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,300
All right, the dancer
likes you very much.

594

It ought to make me very happy.

595
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,500
It makes me feel dreadful.

Shall we invite him
over to the table?

Do you think his manners
would be as nice as yours?

598
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,200
Do you think he'd ask me first
if I'm Harry's lady?

599
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,100
Women can pick the times
to start a row.

600
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,500
It's not a row, darling.
It's very sad.

601
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:23,400
You with your ambition,
me with my guilt.

602

A lot of things are sad.

603
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,100
Why do they put the pads on the horses
in the bullfights?

00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,000
- I've told you that.
- Tell me again.

605
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,900
It isn't so the horses
won't feel the hurt, is it?

606
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,200
It's only for the spectators...

607
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,000
so they won't see
the horses' insides.

608
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,200
Yes, it is for the protection
of the spectators.

609
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,300
I knew you wouldn't like the horses.

610
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,700
But I desperately like the horses.
