(dramatic orchestral music)

00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,442
(steady music)

18
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:57,909
(ringing doorbell)

19
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,622
- Come in!

20
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,545
(crashing)

21
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,296
Oh, it's you!

22
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,673
I'm sorry Arthur.

23
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,092
I thought it was the babysitter.

24
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,135
- Just what do you have
against babysitters?

25
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,304
- Why nothing.
- Nothing?

26
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,765
- It's a psychological
stumbling block.

27
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:24,978
The juvenile mind resents the
restraint of adult authority.

28
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,188
- You ever have the feeling

29
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,523
you're too old for your age?

30
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,109
- Physically, I'm only eight.

31
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,154
Mentally, the doctors
refuse to believe it.

32
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,364
Why do you bring
my sister flowers?

33
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,449
Because you want to marry her?

34
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,243
- It's all part of the racket.

35
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,744
Where is Eloise?

36
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,997
- Putting on her lipstick
so you can kiss it off.

37
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,167
- Come on, young fellow,
I'll put you to bed.

38
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,334
Or your sister and
I are gonna be late

39
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,836
for dress rehearsal.

40
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,171
- Why do I have to go to bed?

41
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,423
Only children go
to bed this early.

42
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,049
- Arthur, I didn't
hear you come in.

43
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,509
- You should have.

44
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,845
I made quite an entrance,
thanks to junior.

45
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,680
- Donald, didn't you
promise mother and dad

46
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,056
you'd be a good boy?

47
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,683
- I am being good.

48
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,476
It just happens
that their standards

49
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,478
are much higher than mine.

50
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,855
- Where's his babysitter?

51
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,356
- His sitter?

52
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,942
Well, Don, go in and wash
your teeth and go to bed.

53
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,903
And don't wake your baby sister.

54
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,865
- What's the matter?

55
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,533
- No babysitter.

56
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,203
- There are dozens of
babysitters in the neighborhood.

57
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,537
- Well, not for my dear brother.

58
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,830
He's been declared us.

59
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,332
- Have you tried the
employment agencies?

60
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,167
- They don't have babysitters.

61
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,419
Well, it looks
like my understudy

62
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,795
will have to go on tonight.

63
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,422
- Start calling every
employment agency

64
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,216
'til you find one that's open.

65
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,259
Get somebody, anybody.

66
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,387
- Sounds like a bad
idea, but I'll do it.

67
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,223
- And I'll handle my pal Donald.

68
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,102
(car honking)

69
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:52,565
(tires screeching)

70
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:57,570
(engine revving)
(car banging)

71
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,408
- That's pretty
reckless driving.

72
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,660
- I'll say it is.

73
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,078
You ought to watch where
you're going, big boy.

74
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,246
- Ah.

75
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,372
- What are you trying
to do, get away?

76
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,082
- Out of my way.

77
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,458
Out of my way, shorty.

78
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,586
(grunting)

79
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,883
(car rumbling)

80
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,927
I ought to run you in for this.

81
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,553
- You're big enough
to carry me in.

82
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,514
- Officer, we're terribly sorry.

83
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,849
- Well alright, but don't
let this happen again.

84
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,810
And get off my car!

85
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,273
(smacking)

86
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,440
- What are you
gonna do with that?

87
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,858
- Put it away.
- Well keep it there.

88
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:36,985
- Yes?

89
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,569
Uh huh.

90
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:39,779
I'd better hang up.

91
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,030
We've been talking
for 10 minutes.

92
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,284
Here comes my heavy
date for tonight.

93
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,118
Bye.

94
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,788
- Who were you
calling a heavy date?

95
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,998
- You.

96
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,457
Can you wait outside
for five minutes?

97
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,792
What a way to get a ticket.

98
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,627
- Well if I do, I
can get it fixed.

99
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,837
I have influence.

100
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,802
- Don't do that!

101
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,429
- Why don't you look
where you're going?

102
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,638
See you outside, baby.

103
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,642
- What do you see in a
tall, dark, handsome fella?

104
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,893
- Plenty.

105
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,020
- Girls never say that to me.

106
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,396
- What do they say to you?

107
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,898
- Shush, nothing exciting.
(phone ringing)

108
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,483
- Cosman Employment Agency.

109
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,486
Yes I have been on the
phone for quite a while.

110
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,363
I'm sorry, we don't
list babysitters.

111
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,823
- Just a minute, lady.

112
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,117
You are looking at the
world's greatest babysitter.

113
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,535
- That's right miss, sure.
- Him?

114
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:28,828
- He is the best.

115
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:29,996
- Where do you fit in to this?

116
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,539
- Oh I'm his agent.

117
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:35,668
- Yes, he lets me keep
10% of everything I earn.

118
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,503
- I'm sorry I took so long,

119
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,882
but fortunately, a professional
babysitter just came in.

120
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,508
May I have your address, please?

121
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,262
Thank you, he'll be right out.

122
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,096
Goodbye.

123
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,015
- Oh thank you miss.

124
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,683
Gee, you're wonderful.

125
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,143
I like girls like you.

126
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,687
Eyes of blue, and five feet two.

127
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,524
Timber!

128
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,069
- Sorry to be late.

129
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,528
- It's okay.

130
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,738
Shall we go?

131
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,073
- You mean you and I
are going out together?

132
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,949
- You see dink, I
have a way with girls.

133
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,159
Please.

134
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,334
- Now listen!
- Yes daddy.

135
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,213
He's so big!

136
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,256
- Come on, we've
got babysitting.

137
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,633
Get with it.

138
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,967
(engine rumbling)

139
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,220
(thudding)

140
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,019
(thudding)

141
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,898
Why, why are you so clumsy?

142
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,066
- I'm excited.
- Why?

143
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,317
- This is my first job.

144
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,694
Gee I hope he's a sweet child.

145
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,196
I love children!
- Come on.

146
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,576
(doorbell ringing)

147
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,078
- It's about time they got here.

148
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,628
- Are you the--
- Babysitter?

149
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,963
He sure is.

150
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,589
- You're kinda big for a baby.

151
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,674
- You're not for me.

152
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,758
- Oh, rejected again.

153
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,051
I guess it isn't my night.

154
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,010
- Won't you come in?

155
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:08,719
- Sure.
- Surely.

156
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,351
- Well, we'll be plenty
comfortable here.

157
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,019
- Well it's too late
to get anyone else.

158
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,771
Have you had much
experience with babies?

159
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,606
- Why yes sir, I've
been a baby all my life.

160
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,941
- Don't you worry about Jack.

161
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,734
The kids just love him.

162
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,278
He makes 'em feel so superior.

163
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,821
- In which they are.
- Sure.

164
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,072
- Well they're
both sound asleep,

165
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,282
and I'm sure you
won't hear a sound

166
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,199
out of them all night.

167
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,534
But if you need anything...

168
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,368
- Oh no, Madame.

169
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,286
I don't need a thing.

170
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,454
I'm prepared for everything.

171
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,247
- No one's prepared for Donald.

172
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,291
- Well, good luck, and
we'll be home after 11:00.

173
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,625
- Oh, you're going
out right now?

174
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,626
Oh, costumes.

175
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,627
Going to a masquerade ball?

176
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,962
- No, a play.

177
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,046
- A play, kids are gonna play.

178
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,089
May I see you out the door?

179
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,799
Excuse me, I'll help you.

180
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,802
Oh miss, in case I want
to see the children,

181
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,012
just where are they?

182
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:51,971
- Oh they're in the
bedroom down the hall.

183
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:52,805
- Thank you.

184
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,031
- High class, huh?

185
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,243
(baby crying)

186
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,828
- Music to my ears.

187
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,663
My first victim.

188
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,915
Duty calls!

189
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,333
See you, Mr. Dinkel!

190
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,213
(baby crying)

191
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,548
This calls for action.

192
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,678
(thudding)

193
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,430
Shush, quiet.

194
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,599
You want to wake up your
sweet little brother?

195
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,309
Now what seems to
be the trouble?

196
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,019
(baby crying)

197
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:40,853
Have a nice nap.

198
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,482
This is my real
business, I know kids.

199
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,608
Goodnight.

200
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,151
- Get me a glass of milk.

201
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,326
- What'd you say?

202
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,954
- I said get me a glass of milk.

203
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,705
- This is unbelievable.

204
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,542
This kid talks better than me.

205
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,961
- You're not very bright.

206
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,337
- I'm sorry, kid.

207
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,421
What school did you go to?

208
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,383
- The baby isn't talking, I am.

209
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,635
- I know you're
talking, but who?

210
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,054
- I'm talking over here.

211
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,639
- This kid ain't
even moving her lips.

212
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,099
This is a baby ventriloquist!

213
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,644
- I'm talking over here.

214
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,229
- I know it's you.

215
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,064
I mean, I'm, your, ah.

216
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:26,732
You?

217
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,242
What's your name?

218
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,076
- Donald.

219
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,035
- Are you a good boy?

220
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,704
- No, it's not my nature.

221
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,247
I'm a problem child.

222
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,001
- Get a load of the kid,
he's a problem child.

223
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,669
Just like me, I think.

224
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,837
Would you like to have
me read you a story

225
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,213
before you fall asleep?

226
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,799
- That's been tried, too.

227
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,261
(thudding)
(grunting)

228
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,638
- Oh this kid, been tried too.

229
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,850
Breath, out, you,

230
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:05,062
I ought to, I ought
to, I ought to...

231
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,356
"Jack and the Beanstalk."

232
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,610
That's my favorite novel!

233
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,613
Donald, can I read this to you?

234
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,282
- Well, I want to
keep you happy.

235
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,367
Let's hear how it goes.

236
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,493
- Thank you, Donald.

237
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,706
Once upon a time,

238
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,374
that's pretty
exciting, isn't it?

239
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:32,214
Once upon a time, a
whole village was tur--

240
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,509
A whole village was terr--

241
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,886
- Terrorized.

242
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:37,678
- Yeah.

243
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,684
Yeah, the whole
village was terrorized

244
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:44,477
by a ferr--

245
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,272
A furr--
- Ferocious.

246
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,065
- Yeah.

247
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,734
Donald, do me a favor.

248
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,235
This is a very exciting book

249
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,737
about the giant and everything.

250
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,574
Will you read it to me, please?

251
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,867
I can't get over the big words.

252
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,203
- Only because I'm
fascinated by you.

253
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,829
Here, hold my club.

254
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,623
- Yes, fascinated.

255
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,960
- Once upon a time,

256
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,005
a whole village was terrorized

257
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,716
by a ferocious giant.
- Yeah.

258
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,344
- Who lived in a
castle in the sky.

259
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:22,139
In this village lived a
simple peasant boy named Jack.

260
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,307
And his widowed mother.

261
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,977
They had come up on hard
times because of the giant.

262
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,939
One day, Jack was told
to bring their only cow

263
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,025
to the market and
sell him for food.

264
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,903
Jack, being very stupid--

265
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:39,407
(voice drowned out by music)

266
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,241
- Hey!

267
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,369
Wee!

268
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:49,500
Ooh, ooh!

269
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,754
(humming)

270
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,507
(exciting music)

271
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,469
Princess Eloise.

272
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,349
(steady music)

273
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,768
(cow mooing)

274
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,571
Your Highness.

275
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,365
- I wonder if I could
have a glass of water.

276
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,408
- Yes, your Highness.

277
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,416
Hey Billy, can you imagine me

278
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,084
getting water for the Princess?

279
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,299
(sighing)
(fabric tearing)

280
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,133
Uh oh.

281
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,933
(goat baaing)

282
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:48,934
See anything, Billy?

283
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,978
(baaing)

284
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,740
Oh Princess, I would've
brung you the water.

285
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,159
- I'm a little tired of
people waiting on me.

286
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,078
It must be wonderful
to be allowed

287
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,832
to do everything you want
to, whenever you want to.

288
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,043
- Oh, you don't get
around much, do you?

289
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:14,960
- What do you mean?

290
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,128
- You mean you haven't heard?

291
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,463
There's no food in the village.

292
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,590
The giant, he's
taken everything.

293
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,426
He's even taken your father's
crown jewels, didn't he?

294
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,678
- That's why I have to
marry Prince Arthur.

295
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,639
- Well, isn't it a love match?

296
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,974
- I've never even seen him.

297
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,768
But his people have money.

298
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,980
Did you ever have to marry
a man you've never seen?

299
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,734
- They tell me I'm a boy.

300
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,487
- So you are.

301
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,239
And a very nice boy.

302
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,158
- Thank you, your Highness.

303
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,368
Why don't you run away?

304
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,702
- Princesses can't do that.

305
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,164
- Oh, but maybe he'll
be young and handsome,

306
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,917
and you'll fall madly
in love with him.

307
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,671
- That only happens
in fairy tales.

308
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,880
Thank you for the water.

309
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,173
- Thank you, your Highness.

310
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,843
And Princess, remember.

311
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,847
Have courage, fear nothing
when you're in the right!

312
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,139
That's my motto!

313
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,441
- Jack.

314
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,693
- Yes, mother?

315
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,362
- Jack, you must stop
talking to yourself.

316
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,989
- I wasn't talking
to myself, mother.

317
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,866
I was talking to
the Princess Eloise.

318
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,995
- Princesses don't
talk to peasant boys.

319
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,582
Oh Jack, when are
you going to grow up

320
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,709
and get some sense?

321
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,085
- Does one go with the other?

322
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,798
- Jack, I've come to a
very important decision.

323
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,133
- You're not gonna give me away.

324
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,676
- No.

325
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,219
If we're not to starve,

326
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,222
I'll have to sell our
last valuable possession.

327
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,058
- No, you're not
gonna sell the cow.

328
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,768
- She has to go.

329
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,353
- You can't sell Henry.

330
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,231
- Jack, how many
times have I told you,

331
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,734
Henry isn't a proper
name for a cow.

332
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:05,070
- Alright, from now on,
I'll call her Halbert.

333
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,572
But you still can't sell Henry.

334
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,408
- Take her to the
market this morning,

335
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,911
but be sure to get a good price.

336
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,039
- Yes mother.

337
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,957
You can depend on me.

338
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,834
Whatever they bid,
I'll bid higher.

339
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,797
- Jack, you'll be
selling, not buying.

340
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:24,965
- There's a difference?

341
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,762
- Fetch me a pale of water,

342
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,888
and then be on your way.

343
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:31,722
- Yes, mother.

344
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:38,228
(gentle suspenseful music)

345
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:40,606
Now look, Henry.

346
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,901
This is the last time
I'm gonna let you look.

347
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,611
You look beautiful.

348
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,781
You and I are gonna
part very soon.

349
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,827
You were the only thing I loved.

350
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,456
Now this is the last look
you're gonna get, Henry.

351
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,290
Take a look.

352
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,625
Don't you look pretty?

353
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,003
Oh, parting is such sorrow.

354
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,380
We gotta go, Henry.

355
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,509
Uh oh.
(trumpets blaring)

356
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,718
- Whoa, boy.

357
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:10,970
Tell me, young fellow,

358
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,721
will this road take me
to the royal palace?

359
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,390
- No sir, but your horse will.

360
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,808
Say, you're Prince Arthur.

361
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,976
- So they tell me.

362
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,853
- Oh boy, will the
Princess be surprised.

363
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,271
- Princess Eloise?

364
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,315
- Mm-hmm, you should've heard

365
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,900
what she said about
you this morning.

366
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,111
- No worse than
I said about her.

367
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,362
Any girl who will marry a man

368
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:32,199
for his father's money--
(rumbling thunder)

369
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,785
- Uh oh, the giant.

370
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,498
It's the giant, Henry.

371
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,833
But you're safe with me.

372
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,042
I won't let him take you.

373
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,796
See?

374
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,006
What did I tell you, Henry?

375
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,757
I protected you.

376
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,801
Now look, Henry, I
gotta go tell the Prince

377
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,469
about the bad giant, stay here.

378
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,764
Hey Prince, where did you go?

379
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,225
Oh come on, this is
no time to play games.

380
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,393
Oh Prince.

381
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,854
Oh Prince!

382
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,356
Hey Prince, hey Prince!
(dogs barking)

383
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,274
Get off me!

384
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,245
Help, help me!
(dogs barking)

385
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,373
(mooing)

386
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,541
He's a rough one, Henry.

387
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:28,881
Cut it out, no!
(dogs barking)

388
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,385
- But why don't
you have any cloth?

389
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,888
- My good woman, for
cloth you need wool,

390
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,097
and for wool you need sheep,

391
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,640
and someone stole all our sheep.

392
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,560
- Oh I don't believe that
silly story about the giant.

393
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,771
- Oh, there's a giant
alright, Mrs. Mergatroyd,

394
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,272
because I saw him.

395
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,566
- You see a lot of things
that other people don't.

396
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,359
- Did you really see him Jack?

397
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,569
- I saw his shadow.

398
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,446
- How do you know it
was the giant's shadow?

399
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,240
- That's a very good
question, goodbye.

400
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,909
- Where are you taking that cow?

401
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,245
- I'm gonna take my cow to
Mr. Dinkelpuss the butcher.

402
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,588
(people chattering)

403
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,424
- What's all the excitement?

404
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,884
- You have a whole cow.

405
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,385
- And don't you
try to deceive us!

406
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,554
- You're not gonna hold this
one for the black market.

407
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,348
The idea of selling those less

408
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,600
sirloin steaks for
seven cents a pound.

409
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,102
There ought to be a law.

410
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,311
- Now ladies, ladies, ladies.

411
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,355
I haven't seen a cow
around here for months.

412
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,358
But you bring somebody to
me with such an animal,

413
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,069
I'll reward him like he's never
been rewarded in his life.

414
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,655
I'll make him rich,
richer beyond his dreams!

415
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,573
I'll pour gold into his pocket.

416
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,742
I'll pour gold so deep, that--

417
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,454
Wait a minute, not
that scrawny animals.

418
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,290
Huh, you're not trying
to pawn him off to me

419
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,084
as first grade beef?

420
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:50,295
Why I wouldn't let my worst
customer use him for stew.

421
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,839
- Her.

422
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,799
And I love Henry.

423
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,592
- Well, everybody
to their taste,

424
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,177
but come inside, Jack,

425
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,429
and I'll give you the
best deal I can afford.

426
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,723
- Come on, Henry.

427
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,063
(cow mooing)

428
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,439
- Imagine that.

429
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,274
I mean, all beef,
we haven't had any,

430
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,191
and look at this cow.

431
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,317
I'd like to get some of that.

432
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,986
- I certainly would, too.

433
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,491
- What you doing?

434
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,160
Hey, what's the idea of that?

435
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,119
- Well I don't want
everyone to know

436
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,704
how generous I am.

437
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,581
- Oh, how much are you
gonna give me for the cow?

438
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,833
- What, you're asking money
for that wonderful animal?

439
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,252
I was gonna give you beans.

440
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,503
- What do I want with beans?

441
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,839
- What do you want
with my magic beans?

442
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,924
I should have my head examined.

443
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,342
Trying to make you rich.

444
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,635
Money you're asking for, eh?

445
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:41,346
I'll give you money,
worthless money.

446
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,389
How much do you want?

447
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,266
Any price at all, how much?

448
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,809
- Now wait a minute,
Mr. Dinkelpuss.

449
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,936
I don't want that
worthless money.

450
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,314
Either I get the magic
beans or I take Henry home.

451
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,358
- Well, you strike
a hard bargain, boy.

452
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,526
- No beans, no cow.

453
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,862
- Well I know when I'm licked.

454
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,322
Come on out in the garden.

455
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,199
I keep my beans
hidden out there.

456
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,491
Come on.

457
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:02,784
- Magic beans.

458
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,037
You gotta get up awfully
early in the morning

459
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,538
to put anything over on me.

460
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,291
Come on, Henry.

461
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,626
Let's go, Henry.

462
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,712
Henry.

463
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:18,508
- One, two, three, four.

464
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,219
Now, they must be
around here someplace.

465
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,553
You've gotta keep
'em buried, you know.

466
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,055
You can't let the village know

467
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,806
where these magic beans are.

468
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:25,891
They're priceless.

469
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:30,979
There they are.

470
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,397
My magic beans.

471
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:37,653
Don't tell anybody that I
gave them to you, will you?

472
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,155
- Yes sir.
- Shush, it's a secret.

473
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,657
But I'll never realize,

474
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,034
I'll never know how you
ever talked me out of them.

475
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,744
- Mr. Dinkelpuss.
- What?

476
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,830
- Can I say goodbye to Henry?

477
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,582
- Well surely, go ahead.

478
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,501
- Alone.
- Alone?

479
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,293
Right ahead.

480
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,760
- I gotta say goodbye now.
(melancholy music)

481
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,428
Be a good boy for
Mr. Dinkelpuss.

482
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:10,060
Do you mind if I kiss
you goodbye, Henry?

483
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,487
You's such a good pal.

484
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,699
- The Princess!

485
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,867
- The giant has
stolen the Princess.

486
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,120
- Henry, you hear
what they're yelling?

487
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:32,291
The giant has
kidnapped the Princess.

488
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,125
(people chattering)

489
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:33,959
Goodbye, Henry.

490
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,214
(melancholy music)

491
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,804
(rumbling thunder)

492
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,689
(cow mooing)

493
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,360
- Now don't worry.

494
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,278
I've been robbed!

495
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:05,782
- Mother!

496
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:08,702
Mother.

497
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:12,831
A terrible thing has happened.

498
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,167
- Oh, somebody swindled
you out of our cow.

499
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,337
- Oh no, I made a
nice deal for Henry.

500
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,339
But the giant
kidnapped the Princess,

501
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,840
and is holding her for ransom.

502
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,967
- Oh the poor girl.

503
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,177
I'll gladly contribute the money

504
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,636
you got for the cow.

505
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:27,929
- Money.

506
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,307
Only a fool would
take worthless money

507
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,475
for such a valuable animal.

508
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,310
I got five magic beans.

509
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,814
- Oh Jack, why is it whenever
I send you on an errand,

510
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,067
you always do the wrong thing?

511
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:43,904
- One, two, three,
four, five magic beans.

512
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,865
Ain't I a smart boy for
out-smarting the butcher?

513
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,533
- You were indeed.

514
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,453
Plant the beans, my boy.

515
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,206
Maybe they'll grow
something that we can eat.

516
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,041
- Mother.
- Plant the beans, Jack.

517
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,796
- I'll plant the beans.

518
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:01,922
I'll plant them.

519
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,592
(humming)

520
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,890
Oh, you're not ordinary
beans, are you?

521
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,058
Please, beans.

522
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,395
Will you grow like magic beans?

523
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,731
So I can prove to my
mother and everybody else

524
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,651
that I'm not addle-brained
like they think I am?

525
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:24,986
Or am I?

526
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,782
Oh magic beans.

527
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:38,417
One, two, three, four, five.

528
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,254
Grow, please grow.

529
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,800
(gentle music)

530
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,097
- Jack, will you
please go to bed?

531
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,224
- Yes mother.

532
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:00,439
Please grow for me,
magic beans, please.

533
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,907
(bright mystical music)

534
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,915
(lively music)

535
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,846
(suspenseful music)

536
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,603
(gasping)

537
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,647
Mother, mother!

538
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:48,570
Mother!
(upbeat music)

539
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:52,866
Mother!

540
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,328
- Jack, what do you want?

541
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,330
- Will you please get my mother?

542
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,289
- I am your mother.

543
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,290
- Mom, mother, look!

544
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,170
Look, the beanstalk!

545
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,471
(people chattering)

546
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,307
(horse whinnying)

547
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,814
- Huge beanstalk!

548
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,066
Look at it!

549
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,360
It goes way up in the sky!

550
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,945
- I tell you all.
(people chattering)

551
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,280
I grew this
beanstalk last night.

552
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,949
With five beans that I planted.

553
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,243
Five magic beans.

554
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,703
- Jack dear, please stop
repeating that nonsense.

555
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,372
- Mother, this isn't nonsense.

556
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,706
This is the truth.

557
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,041
- Hey, are those the
beans that I gave you

558
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,293
for that cow that disappeared?

559
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,753
- You mean Henry ran away?

560
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,296
- Yes, and I want my beans back.

561
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,799
- Don't you dare
disturb that beanstalk.

562
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,676
It might lead up to
the giant's castle.

563
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,719
- So what?
- So what?

564
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,597
Maybe a brave boy will
climb that beanstalk

565
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:00,225
and kill the giant
and save the Princess,

566
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,561
and live happily ever after.

567
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,020
- Oh no, Jack.

568
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,231
The giant will kill you like
he did your poor father.

569
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,066
- Have no fear, mother.

570
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,818
I'm gonna climb that beanstalk,

571
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,319
and I'm gonna kill the giant,

572
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,737
and avenge my father.

573
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,447
And then I'm gonna
save the Princess.

574
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:15,407
And while I'm up there,

575
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,908
I'll look for our little Nelly.

576
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,327
- You mean this
boy had a sister?

577
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,413
You poor unfortunate woman.

578
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,248
- Oh no, Nelly was our hen

579
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,708
who laid the golden eggs.

580
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,877
- A hen that lays a golden egg?

581
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:28,837
- 14 carat.

582
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,088
- Up there?
- Oh sure!

583
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,591
- Well, let me help you, my boy.

584
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,967
- Goodbye, mother.
- I'll go along with you.

585
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,677
- Goodbye, mother.
- That's a boy.

586
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,637
Take your time now.

587
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:38,888
There we go.

588
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,808
- Goodbye mother.
(people chattering)

589
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,645
- Don't worry, Mrs. Strong.

590
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,980
He won't be back.

591
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,773
- You don't understand.

592
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,567
He wasn't much.

593
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:54,112
But he was all I had.

(gentle music)

643
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:12,852
The giant!

644

- I am the butcher.

645
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,647
- Well, cut me up.

646
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,983
Mr. Dinkelpuss.
- What?

647

648

649
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,487
Hey, you're right.

650
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,489
Look at it.

651
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,492
(suspenseful music)

652
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,619
Come on.

653
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,454
- We're in giant land.

654
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,338
Wait a minute.

655
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,925
Look at those footprints.

656
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,218
- Wow.

657
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,262
- We must be getting
close to the giant.

658
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,012
Come on.

659
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,269
Mr. Dinkelpuss.

660
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,520
- Now wait a minute.

661
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,356
Are you sure that hen
Nelly lays golden eggs?

662
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,358
- Mm-hmm.
- 14 carat?

663
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,317
- Mm-hmm.

664
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,278
- Well, then don't be afraid.

665
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,737
- I won't.
- Just follow me.

666
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,200
(steady music)

667
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,667
(suspenseful music)

668
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,379
(growling)

669
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,968
- Wait a minute, Mr. Dinkelpuss.

670
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,219
- What's the matter?

671
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,804
- How come your shadow
is bigger than mine?

672
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:30,722
- Well the taller you are,

673
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,223
the taller your shadow.

674
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,517
You see, that's a basic
principle of mathematics.

675
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:37,186
- I am shorter than you.

676
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:42,400
Therefor, my shadow should
be smaller than yours.

677
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,776
Mathematically speaking, right?

678
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:44,777
- Right, why?

679
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,280
- My shadow is making a fool

680
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,448
out of your mathematics.

681
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,159
- Why, why that's impossible.

682
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,077
That can't be your shadow.

683
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:53,953
- No?

684
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,246
Well watch this.

685
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,791
(gentle music)

686
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,672
- Amazing.

687
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:05,798
- You think so?

688
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:06,633
Now watch this.

689
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,595
(gentle music)

690
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,598
- Can you imagine that?

691
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,558
Now if I didn't see
this with my own eyes,

692
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,101
I wouldn't believe it.

693
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,227
It's absolu--

694
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:22,482
Hey.

695
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,275
What, the--

696
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,488
(suspenseful music)

697
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,118
- Hey Mr. Dinkelpuss,
you've gotta look at this.

698
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,453
This is terrific.

699
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,248
(gentle music)

700
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,975
Mr. Dinkelpuss.

701
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,645
Mr. Dinkelpuss.

702
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,858
Oh, I think he's
afraid of my shadow.

703
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,360
Why don't you be like me?

704
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,904

here before me?

through the forest.

- Did you see what I saw?

751
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:06,831
Did you see that giant?

752
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:07,999
He's as big as the trees.

753
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,711
Please, why did you ever
talk me into this thing?

754
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,754
- I didn't talk you into this.

755
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,548
- Now listen, you know my
reputation in the village.

756
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,341
You know I had to listen to you.

757
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,759
Why did I ever let you do it?

758
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:19,594
Why did you do it?

759
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,137
Well don't stand there

760
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,638
with your mouth wide
open, say something!

761
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,599
- Mr. Dinkelpuss, I'm up
here to save the Princess.

762
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,767
- The Princess?
- We gotta save her.

763
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,644
- You're right, the Princess.
- There's the castle.

764
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:31,480
(wind howling)

765
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,857
Let's go.
- Come on.

766
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,275
What am I doing?

767
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,109
Go ahead.

768
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,208
- Thank you.

769
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,630
- Oh, it's beautiful.

770
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,341
But it's a trifle
too small for me.

771
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,343
- A trifle, she says.

772
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,385
The only thing I do wish

773
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,428
I knew why the master keeps

774
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,180
a wench like you around.

775
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,057
- He likes my cooking.

776
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,517
And I don't want to hear
another word out of you.

777
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,685
- Oh cuckoo.

778
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,687
Can you make an Irish stew?

779
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:14,315
Can you boil a potato like my
poor mother used to boil them?

780
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,776
- I can put you back in the
cupboard if you don't shut up.

781
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,027
- I know you can tell 'em that

782
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,737
you never put the
Princess in her cell

783
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,322
like he told you to.

784
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,615
- You win this time.

785
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,367
- Patrick always wins.

786
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:28,579
Come back to Urden,
my violin, my violin.

787
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,999
Oh just in fine
voice I am today.

788
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:35,419
- I still can't believe
that harp talks.

789
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,671
- He talks too much.

790
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,258
- How do I look?

791
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,342
- Ready to be locked up.

792
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,594
- Well do I have to be?

793
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,680
- Orders, me dainty
beauty, orders.

794
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,265
- Unfortunately, he's right.

795
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:55,231
- I meant to ask you,
are you the giant's wife?

796
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,775
- Heavens no, I'm
his housekeeper.

797
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,944
He stole me last year
from another kingdom.

798
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,029
- Well what will he do with me?

799
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,864
- Release you for
ransom money, perhaps.

800
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,491
- And if there is
no ransom money?

801
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,410
- You'd make a
lovely Sunday dinner.

802
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:14,166
(gentle strumming)

803
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,887
- Music in a dungeon like this?

804
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,431
- Thank you for
calling it music,

805
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,640
whoever you may be.

806
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,850
- Who is he?

807
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,060
- A troubadour the giant
picked up yesterday.

808
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,990
- Who are you?

809
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,409
- I'm just a girl from
the village below.

810
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,828
- What's your name?

811
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,622
- Darlene.

812
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,168
- Are you as pretty
as your name?

813
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:01,005
My guess is yes.
(gently strumming)

814
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,133
- That's a nice melody.

815
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,676
Are there words to it?

816
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,803
- Not yet, but there
can be by tonight.

817
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,348
What will you be doing?

818
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,768
- What did you have in mind?

819
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,103
- A rendezvous in the garden.

820
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:18,105
I'll speak to the
giant about it.

821
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:21,734
- Fee fie foe fum.

822
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:25,363
I smell the blood
of an Englishman.

823
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,991
Be he alive or be he dead.

824
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:32,828
I'll grind his bones
to make my bread.

825
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,372
- Mister, if I'm
too heavy for you,

826
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,498
I'd justly walk.

827
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,332
- Me too.

828
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,460
(laughing)

829
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,880

830
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,051
(banging on door)

831
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:47,885
- Open the door!

832
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,553
- Take me with you.

833
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,348
(giant laughing)

834
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:55,142
- Open the door!
(banging)

835
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:58,396
- Open the door!

836
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,230
Open it!

837
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,953
- Here's some extra
help for the kitchen.

838
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,330
- You're a little
one, aren't you?

839
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,790
- Well I grow on people.

840
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,250
(sneezing)

841
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,085
- Bless you, me boy, bless you.

842
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,253
- Who said that?

843
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,088
- What do you know,
a talking harp.

844
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,424
- You said that?

845
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,550
- I said bless you.

846
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,801
And I'm sorry now that I see

847
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,761
your silly little
face a bit closer.

848
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:31,595
- Oh!

849
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,722
- Thank you, master.

850
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:36,434
'Tis a sight for sore
eyes, it is, yeah.

851
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,935
- Thank you, Patrick.

852
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,937
- Well, I'm off to
hunt in the forest.

853
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,397
- Will you want any supper?

854
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,107
- Just a midnight snack.

855
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,108
- Anyone we know?

856
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:49,071
- Could be.
(laughing)

857
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,030
What's the matter with you?

858
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,490
- Did you hear that?

859
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,284
- Yeah, I hope it's not me.

860

(weeping)

861
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,288
- Then what's the
matter with you?

862
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,667
- You're standing on my foot!

863
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,460
- Ah.

864
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:05,754
- Come with me.

865
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,014
I'll show you what
you're supposed to do.

866
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,640
- Yeah, you show me,
and I'll show him.

867
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,934
- Make the little fat one
work 'til his back breaks.

868
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:21,645
Oh I love the sound
of cracking bones.

869
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:22,813
- You're a bad harp,

870
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,440
and you're gonna have a bad end.

Into the cupboard you go.

874
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,405
- Don't you dare put me in
that dark cupboard again!

875
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:33,073
Don't you dare!

883

Would you like a glass of
milk before supper's ready?

- Thanks.
- Thank you miss.

- Now now wait now now.

889
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:02,686
You're too young to
go out with girls.

890
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,813
- Yeah, but this
might age me fast.

891

Here's to us.

893
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:10,986
- I don't want to
lose any of it.

894
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,238
- Well don't get hoggish.

895
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,864
- To us!
- To us!

896
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,407
Why you sweep me off my feet.

897
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,034
- I'd need a little
help for that.

898
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:17,868
Well, here.

899
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,208
It's Henry's, she's here!

900
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,709
- How do you know?

901
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,379
- No other milk ever
tasted this pleasant.

902
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,630
Where is she?

903
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,881
- There's plenty
of time for that,

904
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,508
but I have an idea
how we can escape,

905
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,300
if you're interested.

906
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,343
- We're interested.

907
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,761
- Not me.

908
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,680
Not unless I can take
along the Princess.

909
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,266
- Does she mean
that much to you?

910
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,935
- Oh no, you jealous?

911
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:43,769
You needn't be.

912
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:45,896
I promised my
mother that I would

913
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,982
return home with the Princess.

914

Huh, is that right?

to know who I am.

944
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:44,682

someone to know me as me.

945
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,059
Not as Princess Eloise.

command, your Highness.

Here, eat this.

948
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:53,190
That will make you
good and strong

949
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,983
so we can sail
you over the wall.

950
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,694
- Sail me over the wall?

951
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,320
- Yes, we're gonna
build catapults

952
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,530
out in the garden.

953
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,489
And the housekeeper,
she thought of it.

954
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,740
She's on our side.

955
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,743
- Oh, you don't supposed
she'd let us out tonight

956
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,412
for a rendezvous in the garden?

957
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:10,582
- Princess, I didn't think
that you cared for me.

958
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,043
- Not you.

959
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,045
I meant the young
man I told you about.

960
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,046
- Oh.

961
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,383
Well, if I approve.

962
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,969
After all, I am one of
your royal subjects.

963
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,512
And I do so want
to see our Princess

964
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:24,930
go out with the right fellow.

965
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,183
Goodbye, your Highness.

966
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,352

967
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,066
Prince Arthur.

968
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,568
I wondered what happened to you.

969
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,487
- Hey, aren't you the
young fellow with the cow?

970
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:41,780
- I'm alone now.

971
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:43,741
Here's your supper.

972
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,744
- I guess the Princess
was disappointed

973
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,245
when I didn't show
up at the wedding.

974
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:51,123
- I never saw a girl
cry so much in her life.

975
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,499
What are you whispering for?

976
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:53,542
- I don't want the
girl in the other cell

977
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,419
to know I'm a Prince.

978
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,378
- You don't?
- No.

979
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,590
Look, you seem to have
some influence around here.

980
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,799
You don't suppose you could--

981
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,301
- Let you out tonight
so you could have

982
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,802
a rendezvous in the garden?

983
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:04,970
- How did you know?

984
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:05,929
- It's a secret.

985
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:08,432
But first of all,

986
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,225
I'll have to get you
some other clothes,

987
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:11,477
because the clothes you have on

988
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,854
make you look too much
like a Prince, Prince.

989
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,314
Or, your Highness, excuse me.

990
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,317
(banging)

991
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,151
I'm sorry.

992
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,615
(squealing)

993
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,035
- What have you decided?

994
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,662
- Well, his parents don't
have the background of yours,

995
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:32,289
but he's a wonderful fellow.

996
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,583
And your loyal subject approves.

997
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:35,459
- Thank you, Jack.

998
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,523
- I just got through
telling the housekeeper,

999
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,398
and now I'm gonna tell you.

1000
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,650
- What's on your mind?

1001
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,901
- The Prince is not the Prince,

1002
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,069
and the Princess is
not the Princess.

1003
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,028
- Then who are they?

1004
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,613
- Just a boy and girl in love.

1005
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,824
Tonight, I want you
to order a full moon

1006
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,534
and keep the stars
shining bright.

1007
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,369
History is gonna
be made tonight.

1008
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,206
- Princess.

1009
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:17,292
- Mr. Dinkelpuss, I just
got through telling you.

1010
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,336
She's not the Princess,
she's Darlene.

1011
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,254
Aren't you, Princess?

1012
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,338
- Are these the catapults?

1013
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,340
- Yes, this is my own creation.

1014
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,175
You see, all you have
to do is get on here,

1015
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,678
I cut the rope, and zoom,
you go right over the wall.

1016
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,555
- Will it work?

1017
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:32,015
- She's asking me will it work.

1018
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,851
(laughing)

1019
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,936
- I'm asking you
too, will it work?

1020
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:36,770
- Will it work?

1021
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,230
Get on here, Jack.

1022
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,690
- Wait a minute,
is it dangerous?

1023
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,442
- Well it's far too
dangerous for a human being.

1024
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,652
But get on here,

1025
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:44,903
I'll show you what
I've been working on.

1026
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:45,821
Get--
- Wait a minute.

1027
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,072
Too dangerous.

1028
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,448
Much too dangerous
for a human being?

1029
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:49,283
Hmm hmm!

1030
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,911
Come, Princess, I mean, Darlene.

1031
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:01,503
- Oh, it's a lovely night
to be somebody else.

1032
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,464
Tell me, what's he like?

1033
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:05,883
- He sings very pretty.

1034
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,718
- Oh I know but shall I,

1035
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,554
shall I let him
kiss me if he tries?

1036
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,889
- Oh Princess.

1037
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,224
Why not?

1038
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,312
- I had your word you
won't try to escape.

1039
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,229
- You have my word.

1040
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:29,489
- Jack!

1041
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,241
Come on.

1042
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,747
- He loves me.
(gentle music)

1043
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:37,581
He loves me not.

1044
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,292
He loves me.

1045
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,085
- Stop right there.

1046
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,253
Don't take a chance.

1047
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,798
- You're...

1048
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:47,633
- And you're...

1049
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,719
- That's right.

1050
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,095
- Is it?

1051
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,014
- I didn't expect somebody so...

1052
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,266
- Neither did I.

1053
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:58,352
- Won't you?

1054
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:00,270
- Sit down?

1055
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,147
- Thank you, I will.

1056
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,610
- Would I be bold if I...

1057
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,947
- If you put your arm around me?

00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:14,728
- What am I doing
with the hammer?

1111
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,062
I'm gonna tap every
one of those hens

'til I find the one that
lays the golden egg.

1113
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:19,316
- Polly want a cracker?

1114
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,985

tired of that line.

sure you find Nelly.

00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,785

(chickens brooding)

1121
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,042
- Mr. Dinkelpuss.
- Yes?

1122
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,501
- Did you find Nelly yet?

1123
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,419
- Not yet!

1124
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,628
- Well she's easy to find!

1125
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,673
She's pure wight and
wears a little red hat.

1126
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,717
- Have you got that
chicken food mixed up yet?

1127
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:46,926
- Oh, will be soon.

1128
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:48,887
And wait 'til you see
the eggs they lay.

1129
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,138
- Well hurry up.

1130
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,389
I've got to get
to the catapults.

1131

(chickens squawking)

1132
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,023
- I'm a little farm boy.

1133
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:03,193
I'm one guy that knows how to
mix this food, Mr. Dinkelpuss.

1134
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,235
- Well feed the chickens!

1135
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:07,197
- I will.
(chickens chattering)

1136
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:11,326
(humming)

1137
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,382
- Go ahead, feed it to 'em.

1138
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:28,301
- Okay, chicky
chicky chicky chicky!

(stomping)

1140

morning to you, master.

1141
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,562
Erin go Bragh.

1142
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,064
- Good morning, harp.

1143
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,399
Housekeeper, housekeeper!

1144
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,486
Where's my breakfast?

1145
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,570
- On the way.

1146
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,531
- And bring me my favorite hen.

1147
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:50,949
- And what, heaven forbid,

1148
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,867
do you see in that
white-feathered biddy?

1149
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:54,327
- Golden eggs, Patrick.

1150
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,371
Solid golden eggs.

1151
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:01,668
- The cells are unlocked,

1152
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,002
and I put the keys back.

1153
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:04,295
- They're whispering, master.

1154
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,630
What are they whispering about?

1155
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,424
- Oh I hate him.

1156
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,008
- Please take care of yourself.

1157
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,762
- I think she's worried.

1158
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:13,763
She cares for me.

1159
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,766
- Where's my breakfast?

1160
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,059
- Yes, master.

1161
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,144
- Here's the eggs.

1162
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,937
Everything is going fine.

1163
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,605
- I'll go mad, stark raving mad

1164
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,940
if they don't stop
that whispering.

1165
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,110
- Hey, get a load
of those jewels.

1166
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,653
(whistling)

1167
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:29,696
Come on.

1168
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,450
- Beautiful they are,

1169
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,160
but can they bring
you happiness?

1170
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,456
- How'd that little
one get in there?

1171
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,626
Where's my breakfast?

1172
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:44,711
- You heard the giant.

1173
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:51,968
Can I help you put 'em away?

1174
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,470
- Can I trust you?

1175
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,889
- Why, what a
ridiculous question.

1176
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,433
- Can I trust you?

1177
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:01,269
- Well frankly, no.
(chicken squawking)

1178
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:03,188
- My jewel of jewels.

1179
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,148
- My jewel of jewels.

1180
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,150
What can she do that I can't do?

1181
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:09,068
- Can you lay a golden egg?

1182
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:12,489
- I shudder at the thought.

1183
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:16,618
- Show him how talented you are.

1184
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:18,036
(squawking)

1185
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,204
Lay, hen, lay.

1186
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:28,463
- Nelly.

1187
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:31,466
How could you?

1188
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:36,137
- It's only gold.

1189
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:37,972
- It's my main source of wealth.

1190
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,433
Take her away.

1191
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:42,810
You.

1192
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,020
- Yes sir.

1193
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,939
- I like a dishonest
man who admits it.

1194
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,233
Carry these jewels
back to the vault.

1195
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,651
She'll show you where it is.

1196
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:50,902
- Yes sir.

1197
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,160
- Do I or don't I
get my breakfast?

1198
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,328
- Yes sir.

1199
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:01,454
- A man could
starve around here.

1200
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:03,540
Make me a small omelet.

1201
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,707
- Two eggs?
- 22!

1202
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:07,252
- 22.

1203
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:10,380
Fresh laid this morning.

1204
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,007
I fixed them special
breakfast food myself.

1205
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,436
(sizzling)

1206
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:58,803
(booming)

1207
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:09,647
(booming)

1208
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,486
(growling)

1209
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,657
(banging)

1210
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:21,951
(crashing)

1211
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,625
- What's all the
shooting around here?

1212
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,959
- Don't ask me, ask the eggs.

1213
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,878
- Eggs don't explode.

1214
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,463
- Oh no?

1215
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,297
Look at this.

1216
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,901
- Ah, give it here.

1217
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:01,658
(booming repeatedly)

1218
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:11,250
(growling)

1219
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:14,879
You numb skull!

1220
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,843
I can't eat, you
ruined my appetite.

1221
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:23,554
- Oh Mr. Giant, you
should eat something.

1222
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:26,307
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1223
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:30,812
- No, no.

1224
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,230
- Oh yeah.

1225
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,107
- Oh no.
- Oh.

1226
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:34,941
- No, no.

1227
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:38,027
Mr. Dinkelpuss!

1228
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:40,905
Mr. Dinkelpuss!

1229
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:49,330
- Boy, when the giant
gets that in the stomach.

1230
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,332
- I'll go get the giant.

1231
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:55,586
♪ Fee fie foe fum

1232
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:59,674
♪ I smell the blood
of an Englishman ♪

1233
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:03,803

1235
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:11,728
(spitting)

1236
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,939
- Mr. Dinkelpuss!
(cranking)

1237
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:16,232
Mr. Dinkelpuss!

1238
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,571
Oh, Mr. Giant, don't!

1239
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:26,409
- The Prince and the Princess,

1240
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,453
they're trying to escape.

1241
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:29,412
- Let them.

1242
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,663
- They've taken your jewels

1243
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:32,582
and your hen that
lays the golden egg.

1244
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:36,043
- The scoundrels.

1245
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:37,670
Keep him solid.

1246
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:40,673
(suspenseful music)

1247
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,813
(growling)

1248
01:02:57,815 --> 01:02:59,901
Who's trying to
steal my treasures?

1249
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,486
- We are, what about it?

1250
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:06,491
(suspenseful music)
(growling)

1251
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:09,327
(banging)
(crashing)

1252
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:12,914
(suspenseful music)

1253
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:13,831
- Oh!

1254
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:15,374
Nice work, Mr. Dinkelpuss!

1255
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:16,751
Hey, get everybody ready,

1256
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:17,960
get the catapults all set,

1257
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,837
and I'll take care of him.

1258
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:20,671
- Come on!

1259
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:22,131
- Polly, get the chains.

1260
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:23,966
Come on, hurry up.

1261
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:24,967
Hurry up, Polly.

1262
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,385
Come on, and get
him all tied up.

1263
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:32,016
(grunting)

1264
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:33,309
Hold him, Polly.

1265
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:36,020
Hold my stuff, hold
my stuff, thank you.

1266
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:39,106
Okay Polly.

1267
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:43,152
Okay, go upstairs now,
I'll take care of him.

1268
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:47,406
(suspenseful music)

1269
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,125
(banging)

1270
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:59,877
Oh, you still hurt.

1271
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:01,963
(banging)

1272
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:06,676
- Ah, it's locked.

1273
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,678
(banging)

1274
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:09,512
Come on, come on.

1275
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:12,974
- Why ain't you folks
out in the garden?

1276
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:13,975
- The door is locked.

1277
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:14,934
- Well, where's the key?

1278
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:16,519
- The giant must have it.

1279
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,688
It isn't with the
rest of the keys.

1280
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:19,856
- Oh, how about the window?

1281
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,107
- It's too high!
- Too high, too high.

1282
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,817
Door's locked, the
window's too high.

1283
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:25,444
- Now what do we do?
- Think Jack, think.

1284
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:27,363
I got it!
- What?

1285
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:28,823
- You take Darlene.

1286
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:29,740
Put her on the mantle
piece over the fireplace.

1287
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,200
Hurry up, come on, quick!

1288
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,870
Mr. Dinkelpuss, you and Polly
get under the chandelier.

1289
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,121
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1290
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,122
- Get under the chandelier.

1291
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:36,956
Hurry up!

1292
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:39,959
(suspenseful music)

1293
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,140
- Master, master.

1294
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,308
'Tis a black day, indeed.

1295
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:56,684
- You keep your mouth shut,

1296
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:58,561
or I'll cut you to ribbons!

1297
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,062
Hey, hey, come here.

1298
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,647
Now look, I'm gonna get
the chandelier over here,

1299
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:02,899
I'm gonna put you on it,

1300
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:03,816
and sail you right
out the window.

1301
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:04,984
And Darlene's coming next.

1302
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:06,277
Then you get her.

1303
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:07,111
Watch out.

1304
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:13,576
(suspenseful music)

1305
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:22,919
Here you are.

1306
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,755
Do be careful.
- I'll try.

1307
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:29,884
(suspenseful music)

1308
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:37,016
- Come on, Mr. Dinkelpuss.

1309
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:38,559
You're next!

1310
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,477
- I'll be right back.

1311
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:40,770
I forgot a couple of things.

1312
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:46,484
(suspenseful music)

1313
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:50,738
(chains rattling)

1314
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:54,283
(growling)

1315
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:59,205
- Mr. Dinkelpuss,
why you greedy boy.

1316
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:00,748
- What do you mean?

1317
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:01,958
- What are you doing with the
giant's jewels, and my Nelly?

1318
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,751
- Nevermind that,
swing me out of here.

1319
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:05,169
- Take your time,
there's no rush.

1320
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:06,337
- What do you mean?

1321
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:07,630
- Quiet, quiet.
(squawking)

1322
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,090
My little gold mine.

1323
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,257
- That's my Nelly.

1324
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:11,175
Let me see the jewels.

1325
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:12,718
- Oh no, they're mine.

1326
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:14,804
All mine, I share
them with no one.

1327
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,473
I, I come a long ways with, I...

1328
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:21,102
Oh.

1329
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:23,813
- Mr. Dinkelpuss, I have
not seen a face like that

1330
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:26,023
since I seen a pork
chop in the window.

1331
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:27,441
And you have no fear.

1332
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:28,359
Polly and I, we
chained the giant up

1333
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:29,860
down in the dungeon.

1334
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:32,488
He can't get away,
because I left him--

1335
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:41,914
(yelling)
(suspenseful music)

1336
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,710
Now Mr. Giant, if you
come one step forward,

1337
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,712
I'll let you have it!

1338
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:50,381
(horns blaring)

1339
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:52,508
- Help me.

1340
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,177
Thanks.

1341
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:58,514
(giant growling)
(suspenseful music)

1342
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,766
(smacking)

1343
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:04,020
(suspenseful music)

1344
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,480
- Mr. Dinkelpuss,
grab the chandelier

1345
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,523
and swing out the window.

1346
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:08,691
Here it comes.

1347
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:20,202
(glass shattering)

1348
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:21,245
- Are you alright?

1349
01:07:21,245 --> 01:07:23,497
- Yes, I'm alright.

1350
01:07:23,497 --> 01:07:25,791
Come on, let's get
to the catapults.

1351
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:28,794
(suspenseful music)

1352
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,299
(growling)

1353
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:47,104
- Hey, hey you!

1354
01:07:47,104 --> 01:07:47,938
Hey!

1355
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,150
(growling)

1356
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:58,199
(yelling)

1357
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:08,876
(smacking)
(suspenseful music)

1358
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,922
(whistling)

1359
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:13,756
Hey you!

1360
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:17,218
(growling)

1361
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:22,389
- Hurry Jack, up on
the mantle piece.

1362
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:25,392
(suspenseful music)

1363
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:30,106
(growling)

1364
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,440
- Coward, pushing
an innocent girl.

1365
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,234
I will show you no mercy.

1366
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:34,777
I will--
(yelling)

1367
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:35,820
(suspenseful music)

1368
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,613
Hurry up, hurry up!

1369
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:40,449
(swords clinking)

1370
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:48,124
Wait a minute, I'm
caught on something!

1371
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,291
Wait a minute!

1372
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,462
Hold it, wait a minute.

1373
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:58,551
(suspenseful music)

1374
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:05,808
(whooshing)

1375
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:09,478
My sword!

1376
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:15,734
(growling)

1377
01:09:15,734 --> 01:09:18,612
(smacking)

1378
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:21,615
(suspenseful music)

1379
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:28,122
(plate crashing)

1380
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:30,291
(banging)

1381
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,837
(growling)

1382
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:45,890
(growling)
(suspenseful music)

1383
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,270
(crashing)

1384
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:58,903
I fear nothing when
I'm in the right!

1385
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:05,451
All aboard for the
catapult express!

1386
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:06,619
- Well, cut the ropes!

1387
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:07,536
No no no, not that one.

1388
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:09,038
Cut those first, then cut yours.

1389
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:10,873
But don't forget to get on.

1390
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:12,374
- Okay.

1391
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:13,626
Hey.
- What?

1392
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:14,877
- Want me to help
you with the jewels?

1393
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:17,755
- Oh no you don't,
they're mine, mine.

1394
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:18,923
Cut the ropes.

1395
01:10:19,798 --> 01:10:21,383
(suspenseful music)

1396
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:23,510
(wooing)

1397
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:31,310
Alright big boy, let's do it.

1398
01:10:34,688 --> 01:10:36,523
Goodbye, Mr. Giant!

1399
01:10:36,523 --> 01:10:37,358
Here I go!

1400
01:10:39,109 --> 01:10:39,902
Wait!

1401
01:10:41,695 --> 01:10:44,615
(gentle music)

1402
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:46,742
(humming)

1403
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:48,953
Mr. Dinkelpuss!

1404
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:57,086
Please come down and get
me like a good little tree.

1405
01:10:57,086 --> 01:11:00,047
(suspenseful music)

1406
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:04,009
(growling)

1407
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:09,098
(smacking)

1408
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,392
(thudding)

1409
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:14,395
(suspenseful music)

1410
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:19,608
(growling)

1411
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:23,237
(gentle music)

1412
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:41,213
(spitting)

1413
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:46,218
(growling)
(suspenseful music)

1414
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,687
(banging)

1415
01:11:58,063 --> 01:11:59,315
Mr. Dinkelpuss.

1416
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:03,485
Mr. Dinkelpuss!
(melancholy music)

1417
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:05,571
The giant got me.

1418
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:06,405
Oh.

1419
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:08,741
What pain.

1420
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:12,244
I'm too young to die.

1421
01:12:12,244 --> 01:12:16,332
- Is this kid kidding?
(squawking)

1422
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:17,708
- Mr. Dinkelpuss!

1423
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:20,794
You gotta help me!
(suspenseful music)

1424
01:12:20,794 --> 01:12:21,628
So I--

1425
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:29,636
(banging)

1426
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:32,639
(suspenseful music)

1427
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:58,207
That was a close one.

1428
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,417
(crashing)

1429
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:04,588
Oh!
(growling)

1430
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:07,216
(suspenseful music)

1431
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,343
(mooing)

1432
01:13:13,597 --> 01:13:15,307
- What about Jack?

1433
01:13:15,307 --> 01:13:17,893
- I'm afraid he gave
his life for us.

1434
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:20,896
(suspenseful music)

1435
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:43,419
- Uh oh!

1436
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:03,480
Oh!
(suspenseful music)

1437
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:17,828
(thudding)

1438
01:14:21,915 --> 01:14:24,126
(thudding)

1439
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,714
(thudding)

1440
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:33,302
(suspenseful music)

1441
01:14:35,053 --> 01:14:37,222
(booming)

1442
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:44,980
(suspenseful music)

1443
01:14:57,951 --> 01:15:00,287
(squawking)

1444
01:15:18,138 --> 01:15:19,473
(majestic music)
(people chattering)

1445
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:21,642
- Look, I found a diamond!

1446
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:24,853
- Thanks.

1447
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:31,026
- Look, a diamond!

1448
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:32,819
- I see three people descending!

1449
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:34,279
- My dear boy Jack.

1450
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:36,698
Do you see him?
(people chattering)

1451
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:38,033
Oh Nelly!

1452
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:39,910
You've come back to us.

1453
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:41,745
Ugh, we'll be rich again.

1454
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:45,165
- The King, the King!

1455
01:15:45,165 --> 01:15:50,170
- All hail the King.
(majestic music)

1456
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:10,566
- My daughter!

1457
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:13,569
Oh, thank heaven you're safe.

1458
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,571
- She's the Princess?

1459
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,072
Princess Eloise?

1460
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:18,615
- Why of course, Prince Arthur.

1461
01:16:18,615 --> 01:16:20,742
Who did you think she was?

1462
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:22,911
But what are you doing
in those clothes?

1463
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,746
- You're Prince Arthur?

1464
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:25,914
- Small world, isn't it?

1465
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:29,001
- I never want to
speak to you again

1466
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:30,460
as long as I live.

1467
01:16:31,461 --> 01:16:32,588
Let us go, father.

1468
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:37,759
- Darlene, I mean Eloise,

1469
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:39,886
what's the difference who we are

1470
01:16:39,886 --> 01:16:41,430
as long as we love each other?

1471
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:42,889
- You knew all the time a Prince

1472
01:16:42,889 --> 01:16:44,433
couldn't break an engagement.

1473
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:47,603
- And neither could a Princess.

1474
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:50,105
How are you going to get out
of marrying Prince Arthur?

1475
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:51,231
- Well how are you
going to get out
