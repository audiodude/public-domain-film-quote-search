1
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,469
<i>Who has never dreamed of knowing heaven on earth,
of sailing away to a desert island?</i>

2
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,087
<i>Well, here's a story
of such a dream come true.</i>

3
00:01:01,122 --> 00:01:03,900
<i>A story that starts in London,
at tea time.</i>

4
00:01:03,935 --> 00:01:07,316
<i>Which is not surprising
since it's always tea time in London.</i>

5
00:01:07,491 --> 00:01:11,993
<i>On this particular day at the house
of The Honourable Mr. Bramwell.</i>

6
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,278
Your tea, Mr. Bramwell.

7
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,596
The guest from America
is waiting outside.

8
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,198
The guest from America?

9
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:25,754
Oh, we can't keep him waiting.
Eh, gentlemen?

10
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,113
Well, don't stand there gaping, Pringle.
Show him in, immediately.

11
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,756
Will you go in now?

12
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,914
Mr. Laurel, I presume.

13
00:01:46,949 --> 00:01:50,549
No, I'm Mr. Hardy,
Mr. Laurel's financial exchequer.

14
00:01:50,668 --> 00:01:54,389
- But where is Mr. Laurel?
- Right here. Mr. Laurel is...

15
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,910
Ah, Mr. Laurel,
we've had quite a time finding you.

16
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:02,249
Now gentlemen,
let me introduce the two attorneys

17
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,924
that handled your late Uncle's affairs
in France and In Italy

18
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,598
Mr. Hardy... Monsieur Bonfois.
Mr. Laurel... Signor Paltroni

19
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,993
Signor Paltroni... Mr. Hardy,
Mr. Bonfois... Mr. Laurel.

20
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,109
My name is Bramwell.
Mr. Hardy!

21
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,953
Well, gentlemen...
Could we get down to business?

22
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,918
Oh, thank you, Stanley.

23
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,979
Now,
just how much was this legacy?

24
00:02:30,014 --> 00:02:34,956
Oh, you Americans, you never seem
to believe in formalities, do you?

25
00:02:35,294 --> 00:02:40,269
There's one thing about us.
We always believe in business before pleasure.

26
00:02:40,832 --> 00:02:43,151
You see...

27
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,170
Pardon me...

28
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,540
Thank you very much.

29
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,090
Now, could we proceed?

30
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,128
As a matter of fact
we'd better get right to business.

31
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,940
Your Uncle was quite an eccentric.

32
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,453
He didn't believe in banks.

33
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,134
He insisted in keeping his money in cash.

34
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,697
- And here it is.
- What is it?

35
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,136
It's money...
I think.

36
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,482
Indeed, it is money,
and a very large sum.

37
00:03:51,517 --> 00:03:54,201
- Italian lira.
- And French francs.

38
00:03:54,236 --> 00:03:55,454
And English pounds.

39
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,537
Stanley...

40
00:03:58,086 --> 00:04:01,384
Mr. Laurel, before we actually
turn this money over to you

41
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:04,128
there are some administrative charges.

42
00:04:04,163 --> 00:04:08,696
These include, overhead legal charges,
deflation and motisation,

43
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,929
currency fluctuation, foreign exchange
and a few other incidentals.

44
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,733
Gentlemen!

45
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,813
Here's your receipt, Mr. Laurel.

46
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,539
Alright, gentlemen.

47
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:35,556
My dear Mr. Hardy,
there is another small item.

48
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:37,292
- What now?
- The taxes.

49
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,898
To save you time
we've had them all figured out.

50
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:44,055
Including, naturally,
a slight fee for our services.

51
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,051
These deductions represent, income taxes,
state taxes, inheritance taxes,

52
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,531
death taxes and living taxes.

53
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,658
And a few other plain taxes.
Gentlemen...

54
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,770
Wish Uncle had left me the taxes!

55
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,253
Is that all we get?

56
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,129
- Oh... But you also get an island!
- An island?

57
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,138
- And a beautiful yacht.
- A yacht?

58
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:25,892
A yacht. Yes. The yacht is tied
to a dock in Marseilles, France.

59
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,373
And the island is here,
in the south seas.

60
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,505
- Gee, that sounds wonderful, Ollie!
- Well, that sounds swell. But...

61
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,490
How much are the taxes on that?

62
00:05:36,525 --> 00:05:39,651
Oh, none.
The island is absolutely tax free!

63
00:05:39,686 --> 00:05:41,929
- Here's your money.
- The papers for the boat.

64
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,326
And this is the deed to the island.

65
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:48,136
Well, now, that cleans out.
I mean, that cleans up the estate.

66
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,850
- Gentlemen, I bid you good day.
- Come, Stanley.

67
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,370
Why don't you be careful?

68
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,698
Take a look.
Here's your little boat, gentlemen.

69
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,064
And here's your port clearance.

70
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:22,699
We're going to need a crew for this one.

71
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,011
A crew? What do we need a crew for?
I'm running this boat!

72
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,472
Well, let's get on it.

73
00:06:27,507 --> 00:06:29,448
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Dock fees.

74
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:32,063
- How much?
- 19.000.

75
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,372
Thank you, sir
and bon voyage.

76
00:06:35,407 --> 00:06:37,284
- Merci beaucoup.
- Good day.

77
00:06:37,285 --> 00:06:39,536
- Bon tomorrow!
- Thank you.

78
00:06:39,571 --> 00:06:42,696
It's a good thing he didn't take the taxes.
We'd have had nothing left.

79
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,697
Oh, pardon me. Thanks a lot for reminding me.
I forgot about it.

80
00:06:48,394 --> 00:06:50,446
Monsieur...

81
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,133
Oh, thank you...
It's much too much, sir. Much too much.

82
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,602
What did you have to open
your big mouth for?

83
00:06:59,603 --> 00:07:01,215
I didn't know he was going to take it.

84
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,411
Come on and let's take a look
at the boat.

85
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,017
We've got plenty of gas!

86
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,819
Let that thing alone!

87
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,768
Put that down!

88
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,808
- Look, there’s a tunnel.
- Look.

89
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,003
See?
Let's go down.

90
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,988
Why don't you watch
where you're walking?

91
00:08:33,989 --> 00:08:35,096
I couldn't help it.

92
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,939
Oh, never mind that...
Let's see what we've got here.

93
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,095
- I didn't know they were living underneath.
- Well, they've moved now!

94
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,139
- What'd he say?
- I wouldn't care to repeat it.

95
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,666
Come on!

96
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,094
- What happened?
- Mind your own business!

97
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,255
Oh, look!

98
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,495
What is it?
It's an emergency life raft for four people.

99
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,375
- You can't get four people into this thing!
- You don't understand...

100
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,689
Inside is a compressed air cylinder.

101
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:01,332
When you release the valve it blows up
large enough to carry four people.

102
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,452
- Well, what about me?
- You don't have to be insulting.

103
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,771
Haven't I always taken care of you?

104
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,776
You're the first one I think of.

105
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,290
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings,
Ollie.

106
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,945
Ollie.

107
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,337
Ollie.

108
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,178
Take that snake skin off
and get that cargo aboard!

109
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,492
What about me...

110
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,577
What about me?

111
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,299
Don't waste time like that.
Throw them to me and I'll put them there.

112
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,848
Look at that!

113
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,138
- What goes on here?
- There's a man in the cage!

114
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,293
- I bet it's Antoine again.
- But the guy must be mad.

115
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,934
- I'm a monkey, I tell you!
- He's a stateless man.

116
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,688
- A what?
- Somebody who has no nationality.

117
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,171
He's not a bad guy, really.
It's just that no country seems to want him.

118
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,532
He'd do anything to get back on land.
Let's go, Antoine.

119
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,214
Don't you know it's against the law
to land here without a passport?

120
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,498
Punish me, teach me a lesson,
put me in prison!

121
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:10,169
But remember, to put me in prison
you've got to let me land.

122
00:13:10,204 --> 00:13:13,421
- How long has he been on your ship, captain?
- Oh, months.

123
00:13:13,456 --> 00:13:19,051
He tried to get ashore at Tetrokovac,
Nagasaki, Caracas, Sydney,

124
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,969
Brooklyn, Salonika...
Everywhere we stop.

125
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,333
- All I ask for is a country.
- Well, get a passport!

126
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,577
Oh, that's easy to say...

127
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:32,412
How can I get a passport
if I have no country?

128
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,852
And how can I get in the country
if I have no passport?

129
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,389
I didn't make the regulations.

130
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,053
You're not allowed to land
in this country and that's the law!

131
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,847
Fine laws!

132
00:13:41,882 --> 00:13:44,737
You land monkeys without a passport
but not human beings!

133
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,375
Take him back on board.

134
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,333
Let's go!

135
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,819
Canned food, one crate...
Canned food, one crate.

136
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,484
- Six sheets plywood...
- Six sheets plywood.

137
00:14:04,485 --> 00:14:06,299
- Sugar, one sack...
- Sugar, one sack.

138
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,815
Oh... alright.

139
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,976
Won't you ever stop
playing hide and seek with us?

140
00:14:32,977 --> 00:14:34,595
Go on.
Beat it and quick!

141
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,213
But you two always stop me.

142
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,062
Now, see here.
You're probably a good stonemason.

143
00:14:39,063 --> 00:14:40,648
Why don't you go and work in Italy?

144
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,534
- But I'm an immigrant!
- That's just it. Immigrant in Italy.

145
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,977
Are you kidding? How can you immigrate
to place you've left already?

146
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,739
Well, maybe,
but one sure thing...

147
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,498
You're not going to leave Marseilles
without paying your passage.

148
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,339
Good morning, boys.

149
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,128
- What'd you say?
- I haven't opened my mouth!

150
00:15:06,163 --> 00:15:07,174
Good morning, boys!

151
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,939
- Going on a vacation?
- We're going to the South Seas.

152
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,800
It's a long trip there
and a long way back!

153
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,271
But we're not coming back.

154
00:15:17,272 --> 00:15:20,170
You see, we own an island
out there. Don't we, Ollie?

155
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,176
- Say, how do you start an engine?
- With a mechanic, of course!

156
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,133
We can't afford one.
We haven't got any money.

157
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,135
We did have
but they took it all for taxes!

158
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:32,598
Well, don't worry.

159
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:35,259
I'm going to send you a mechanic
and he won't cost you a cent!

160
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,537
- Well, everything's arranged.
- What is? My execution?

161
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,016
There are two characters along side.

162
00:15:46,017 --> 00:15:49,372
They own an island in the South Seas.
You're invited.

163
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,936
And you won't need a passport
to get ashore.

164
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,898
Thank you.
Thank you.

165
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,615
- Good morning, Stanley.
- Good morning, Ollie.

166
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,375
- Where are we?
- Well, we're here.

167
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,338
We shouldn't be.
We'll have to change our course.

168
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,730
Keep her on course.
You can eat later.

169
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,369
- But I'm hungry.
- So am I! Selfish!

170
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,212
- Your hat.
- Oh, thank you.

171
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,688
Forgetting your manners
when you get...

172
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,370
Stanley, this is wonderful.
The sea, the sky, the sun...

173
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,258
And you and I alone
on the bounding main.

174
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:54,609
What do you mean, alone?
He's with us.

175
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,824
Oh, of course, Antoine.
He's our very, very good friend.

176
00:17:58,825 --> 00:18:00,135
Yes, sir.

177
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:04,730
- And we'll share and share alike.
- Thank you.

178
00:18:04,731 --> 00:18:07,533
Thank you.

179
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,609
Stanley, open the skylight
so we can get some of that good sea air.

180
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:28,009
You know what? You need glasses.
It's already open.

181
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,531
When you get to the island
you'd better see an optimist.

182
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,814
Hot rolls and butter.
And then Antoine will present his specialty.

183
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,493
That sounds good.

184
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,457
I'm going to enjoy that, I know.
I love cote du...

185
00:19:34,643 --> 00:19:35,705
Hey, Antoine.

186
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,822
I suppose in the garnis
you use a small touch of garlic.

187
00:19:39,823 --> 00:19:41,611
Oh, I hardly use a pinch.

188
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:01,698
A man that would steal food from a friend
is the smallest thing in the world.

189
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,967
Oh, I don't know...

190
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:07,851
All I hope, Stanley,
is that you enjoyed your roll.

191
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,268
How could I enjoy it,
when you stole it?

192
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:12,617
What do you mean, I stole it?
You stole it!

193
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:17,767
I would like you to know how happy I am
to have you both as my friends.

194
00:20:17,802 --> 00:20:20,088
I would like to give you a toast.

195
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:22,615
- I give you friendship!
- Friendship!

196
00:20:22,616 --> 00:20:23,616
Here's how!

197
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,458
Lets have another, eh?

198
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,514
- To Friendship!
- To Friendship!

199
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:08,138
- To Friendship!
- Here's to your health!

200
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,778
- Friendship...
- That's something really swell, no?

201
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,737
No!
Definitely no!

202
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,408
Ah, the chops are done.
Sit down, my friends.

203
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:31,529
Antoine is going to serve you
his masterpiece.

204
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,723
- What's the matter now?
- You know what's the matter.

205
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:20,565
I want my chop!
Varnished with garlic!

206
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,986
You've got a lot of nerve...

207
00:22:23,987 --> 00:22:26,572
You want my chop
after you've eaten yours!

208
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,211
- I'm sorry.
- Well you should be!

209
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,134
Just a minute!

210
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,415
Where's my potato?

211
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:47,216
Now, listen... If you think I've eaten
your roll and your potato, weigh me.

212
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,011
Well, if you didn't, who did?

213
00:23:04,609 --> 00:23:06,373
You can't scare us with that.

214
00:23:06,374 --> 00:23:09,722
As admiral of this ship,
I'll have Stanley put you in irons!

215
00:23:09,757 --> 00:23:12,298
What's all this about?

216
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:18,418
- You stole my potato!
- Yeah! And my roll... and chop!

217
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,182
Incidentally...

218
00:23:21,217 --> 00:23:22,687
Who's steering the boat?

219
00:23:22,722 --> 00:23:28,263
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
I tied the wheel on it's course.

220
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,831
Well, for once
you have used your head.

221
00:23:37,832 --> 00:23:42,325
Thank you, Ollie.
I'll try to do that more often.

222
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,804
- What was that?
- The motor's stopped!

223
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,539
- Fix it. You're the engineer.
- To tell you the truth, I'm not a mechanic.

224
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,739
The captain on that boat cooked up that story
just to get rid of me.

225
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:03,659
As usual,
I'll have to do everything myself!

226
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,579
- Get up on deck and standby!
- Stand by what?

227
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,819
Stand at the deck!

228
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,423
We'll take this little matter up later!

229
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,529
What do you think is wrong with it?

230
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,659
It's no use guessing.
We'll just have to take it apart and find out.

231
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:33,659
- In other words, use your head.
- What for?

232
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,819
Well, you could use yours
for a bowling ball!

233
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:43,531
- You mean one of those with a hole in?
- Exactly!

234
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,804
Now, give me a hand.

235
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:53,218
Now let that be a lesson to you.

236
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:05,751
Here.

237
00:25:17,982 --> 00:25:20,674
Put that down!

238
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:35,636
Ollie?

239
00:25:35,671 --> 00:25:37,287
What?

240
00:25:37,322 --> 00:25:40,219
The gas tank's empty!

241
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,419
Why didn't you tell me that before?

242
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:47,338
Give me the parts
and I'll put them back together.

243
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:02,780
Now we've got nothing left but the sail.

244
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,325
Now, when I give the signal you pull.

245
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,019
What are you doing?
I could have broken my arm!

246
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,297
Who are you
and what are you doing on this boat?

247
00:26:25,298 --> 00:26:26,459
You have no rights here!

248
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,372
I have my rights!
I'm coming as a stowaway!

249
00:26:29,407 --> 00:26:31,687
They didn't tell us
a stowaway came with the boat.

250
00:26:31,722 --> 00:26:33,225
- No.
- Listen fellas...

251
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,774
I could have easily been a stowaway
on any other boat.

252
00:26:35,775 --> 00:26:37,099
I happened to pick this one.

253
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,539
Then you have to find me
and spoil everything.

254
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,952
We had to use the sail
because the engines broke!

255
00:26:42,987 --> 00:26:47,459
- Well, why don't you try fixing the motor?
- We tried to, but it fell in the sea.

256
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,596
Fell in the sea...

257
00:26:48,597 --> 00:26:52,762
Just my luck to be a stowaway
on a boat run by two land lubbers!

258
00:26:52,797 --> 00:26:56,099
Who manage to drop the engine in the ocean!
The ocean!

259
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,619
You know,
I think we've offended him.

260
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,179
What's happening?
What goes on here?

261
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,219
We've got a stowaway aboard.
This is Antoine, the chef.

262
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,052
- Giovanni Copini.
- Glad to meet you, sir.

263
00:27:05,087 --> 00:27:07,884
- And this is Stanley.
- How do you do.

264
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,737
How do you do.

265
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,167
Why don't you be careful?

266
00:27:21,202 --> 00:27:23,824
Come on...
We can't waste all day just talking!

267
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:26,099
Get that rope!
Get the sail up! Go ahead!

268
00:27:26,134 --> 00:27:28,339
You, the fat one,
get on the other side!

269
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,608
Pull!
It takes muscle to raise a sail!

270
00:27:30,643 --> 00:27:33,846
The fat one, the other side!
All together now!

271
00:27:39,123 --> 00:27:40,624
Pull!

272
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,394
Just in time to eat lunch.

273
00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:23,019
Never mind eating.
What happened to my pants?

274
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,769
I put them right there to dry.
Can you...

275
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,778
Hey, the boat's moving!

276
00:28:31,068 --> 00:28:33,042
You get...

277
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,459
- Kinda nice, eh, Stanley?
- Sure is.

278
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,199
Just like playing hooky from school.

279
00:28:49,234 --> 00:28:51,939
We're all playing hooky more or less.

280
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:55,059
Giovanni,
what are you playing hooky from?

281
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:59,460
From a world where I'm always being told
what to do and how to do it.

282
00:28:59,495 --> 00:29:01,463
We don't blame you.

283
00:29:01,498 --> 00:29:02,809
And you,
what are you playing hooky from?

284
00:29:02,844 --> 00:29:03,872
Taxes!

285
00:29:03,907 --> 00:29:06,901
Yeah...
We don't like taxes!

286
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:11,407
Hey, Antoine... What about you?
Where is your home?

287
00:29:11,442 --> 00:29:17,309
My home? I don't know?
The whole world ought to be man's country.

288
00:29:17,344 --> 00:29:22,505
But for me...
Someone seems to have locked all the doors.

289
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,179
I can just see our island now...

290
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,652
Palm trees...
Flowers...

291
00:29:29,687 --> 00:29:34,602
The sun to warm us...
And the gentle rain.

292
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,093
A storm! Don't you think
we'd better get the boat ready?

293
00:29:47,128 --> 00:29:48,859
Yes,
it looks like a bad one.

294
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,379
- I never saw one like this before.
- Me either!

295
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,883
- We'd better pull down the sail!
- I'll go get the life raft!

296
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:29,337
Pull down the sail!

297
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:14,420
Help!
Help!

298
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,500
Ah, look at that!

299
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,309
An island!

300
00:34:37,344 --> 00:34:40,539
We're on an island!
Stanley, we're on an...

301
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,928
We're on an island!
Take a peep!

302
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,699
Take a peep!

303
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:59,108
I'm too popped to peep.

304
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:06,650
Oh, look...
Oh, boy!

305
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,515
An atoll!
That's what it is! An atoll!

306
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,019
Come on!

307
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:16,779
- Easy, easy!
- It's alright! It's alright.

308
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,476
Let's go fishing now, eh?
Hand me a basket.

309
00:35:19,511 --> 00:35:20,739
Right away!

310
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:24,539
Quick! A pot, some wood.
Build a fire for the bouillabaisse.

311
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,369
Don't forget to put some garlic in it?

312
00:35:26,404 --> 00:35:30,128
Oh, without it,
it wouldn't be a real bouillabaisse.

313
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,173
- Well, it don't look so bad.
- Still in good condition.

314
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,823
Antoine, what time
are you serving dinner?

315
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:34,524
If you want to eat,
you'd better go build a fire.

316
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:37,377
And you, my boy...
Go clean the fish.

317
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:41,444
You get the paper
and I'll get the wood.

318
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,419
- Ollie?
- Yeah?

319
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,688
Hold this a minute, will ya?

320
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:05,248
You know, boys? There seems to be
a lot of room for building houses here.

321
00:37:05,283 --> 00:37:07,667
Yeah...
It sure is naked around here.

322
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:10,219
Admiral,
what do we do on a deserted island?

323
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:15,259
Here's a man that was shipwrecked
and he did alright. Listen.

324
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,159
Robinson Crusoe
was born in the city of York.

325
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,059
His father wanted him
to become a lawyer.

326
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:25,109
But young Crusoe longed to go to sea.

327
00:37:33,646 --> 00:37:38,130
<i>Our modern Robinson Crusoe's
have gotten used to their new life.</i>

328
00:37:38,165 --> 00:37:43,889
<i>By using the latest scientific farming methods
they have tamed the wild land.</i>

329
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:54,226
<i>And Mother Nature has supplied them
with plenty of fresh water.</i>

330
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:59,682
Oscar.
Oscar!

331
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:25,219
<i>For the animals as well as for the men
this island has become a real paradise.</i>

332
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:31,506
<i>Yes, but a Garden of Eden without Eve
and Adam is bored.</i>

333
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:35,939
<i>But... But what's this?
Where are these skipping stones leading us to?</i>

334
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,499
<i>To Papeete,
the capital of Tahiti.</i>

335
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:43,139
<i>And who do we find? Eve!
I beg your pardon... Chérie Lamour.</i>

336
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,017
<i>Today is her big day.</i>

337
00:38:45,052 --> 00:38:50,268
<i>First of all she is taking an audition at
the Cockatoo, the smartest night club in town.</i>

338
00:38:50,303 --> 00:38:54,680
<i>And also she is expected at the courthouse
for an important occasion.</i>

339
00:38:54,715 --> 00:38:58,444
<i>She's going to marry Lieutenant Jack Frazer.</i>

340
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:03,378
Miss Lamour, this way, please.

341
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,990
Oh, sweetheart,
I'm so pleased.

342
00:39:08,025 --> 00:39:09,739
It hardly looks like it.
You're three quarters of an hour late!

343
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,719
You're not going to grumble
about three little quarters of an hour?

344
00:39:12,754 --> 00:39:14,619
Marriage is a most important thing.

345
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:17,038
And I should like
before proceeding any further...

346
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:19,347
- I got my contract.
- What contract?

347
00:39:19,382 --> 00:39:21,775
When we're married we're going
to share everything in common.

348
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,438
That's not what I'm talking about.

349
00:39:23,473 --> 00:39:26,139
My contract with the Cockatoo!
My debut's tomorrow night.

350
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,299
So you'll be able to come and see me
before you sail.

351
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,166
Miss Lamour...
If you please...

352
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:33,139
Oh, but I'm listening to you,
Your Honour.

353
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:37,379
Miss Lamour, Lieutenant...
Marriage is a most important thing.

354
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:40,099
- Just a minute.
- It's most unusual but if...

355
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:44,019
Am I to understand that you intend
to continue your career after we are married?

356
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,833
But of course, my sweetheart.
You never suggested I should give it up.

357
00:39:47,868 --> 00:39:50,668
I never broached the subject
because I took it for granted

358
00:39:50,703 --> 00:39:53,509
that you would devote yourself
entirely to me.

359
00:39:53,544 --> 00:39:56,514
Nothing would please me more
if you were here all the time.

360
00:39:56,549 --> 00:39:59,736
But when you spend ten months
out of the year sailing the seas.

361
00:39:59,771 --> 00:40:02,915
What do you expect me to do?
Swim behind your little barge?

362
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:06,059
- Calm yourself, Miss Lamour.
- I'm very calm, Your Honour!

363
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,339
But I'm not going to submit
to this kind of blackmail!

364
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,739
In that case
I'm not going to hang around here.

365
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,819
You think about it,
but think fast.

366
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,146
Please, sir...

367
00:40:15,181 --> 00:40:18,291
Let him go away, Your Honour.
I won't run after him! Do you hear me?

368
00:40:18,326 --> 00:40:19,837
Miss Lamour...

369
00:40:19,872 --> 00:40:21,811
He'll never see me again.

370
00:40:21,846 --> 00:40:26,813
I don't know what I'll do yet
but I’ll see to it he never finds me.

371
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,539
Come here.
I want to talk to you.

372
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,824
Where were, you fellas, a while ago?

373
00:40:54,859 --> 00:40:57,379
I was down at the beach
getting these fish for dinner. See?

374
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,739
I was working in the garden.

375
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,139
Did you see or hear anything?

376
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,219
- Just the waves.
- Why?

377
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,949
I'll tell you why.

378
00:41:05,984 --> 00:41:10,902
Because I was down by the lagoon
and I thought I heard the engines of a big boat.

379
00:41:10,937 --> 00:41:14,539
Then it whistled.
By the time I climbed up to see...

380
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:19,009
- There was nothing there.
- That's because it had gone.

381
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,407
- What had gone?
- The boat.

382
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:31,154
You mean to tell me that you saw a boat
and didn't let us know?

383
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:35,685
I saw and I waved to it
but it didn't wave back, so I...

384
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,498
Get us something to drink
before I forget myself.

385
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,574
Pardon me.

386
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:01,990
- What’s the matter with you?
- I think I saw something.

387
00:42:02,025 --> 00:42:07,211
- What are you talking about?
- There's a girl in the kitchen.

388
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:10,922
You are absolutely right.

389
00:42:10,957 --> 00:42:12,499
There she is!

390
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,043
Hello.

391
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:27,613
- Hello, fellas.
- How did you get here?

392
00:42:27,648 --> 00:42:29,189
Well...

393
00:42:29,224 --> 00:42:33,859
- You might say I was dropped by a witch.
- Like one that rides on a broom?

394
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:37,579
I'm sorry for this intrusion, but
you'll have to take me as a guest, I'm afraid.

395
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,515
It will be a pleasure.

396
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:42,779
I knew I should have built a guest house
a long time ago.

397
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,144
Oh...
There's no place for me to stay?

398
00:42:45,179 --> 00:42:47,886
Don't you worry
your pretty little head about that.

399
00:42:47,921 --> 00:42:50,593
Giovanni and Antoine
will move in with Stanley and me.

400
00:42:50,594 --> 00:42:52,803
And you can stay right here.

401
00:42:52,838 --> 00:42:53,895
You're very kind.

402
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:56,865
Come, my little princess,
and I shall show you to your boudoir.

403
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,270
You know,
I think I'm going to like this place.

404
00:43:00,305 --> 00:43:03,641
It's swell.
You don't have to shave or anything.

405
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:13,166
I left my cases down at the beach
with all my things.

406
00:43:13,201 --> 00:43:16,339
Gentlemen, get the lady's luggage
and bring it to her chateau.

407
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,579
Thank you.

408
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,149
What's that funny thing up there?

409
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:23,434
That, my dear, is the wreckage
of the good ship Momus.

410
00:43:23,469 --> 00:43:26,719
I shall never forget the day
that I found this island.

411
00:43:26,754 --> 00:43:29,699
It was a terrible night,
dark as pitch.

412
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,859
It was so pitch, you couldn't see
your hand behind your back.

413
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,139
Exactly, Stanley!

414
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:39,019
Then, all of a sudden
I spotted that harbour.

415
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:42,265
I put her bow
into the teeth of the gale,

416
00:43:42,266 --> 00:43:46,979
lashed myself to the wheel
and beached her on that pinnacle.

417
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,539
And it's been there ever since.

418
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,525
Well boys, you must have had
trouble getting it up so high.

419
00:43:52,526 --> 00:43:53,619
He read it in a book.

420
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:57,379
Come, my dear.
Book...

421
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:01,708
One, two, three...
All there. Thank you.

422
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:52,207
Stanley, have you forgotten
that we have company?

423
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:00,764
Gentlemen,
make yourselves comfortable.

424
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,124
Gentlemen!

425
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,259
Stanley...

426
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:43,419
- This is my side.
- Well, there's no room on my side.

427
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:46,779
Well, the fair thing to do
is to take turns.

428
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:52,779
While one sits up, the other sleeps
and when he wakes up, we change.

429
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:57,939
Now, that's what I call a sport.
Thank you, Ollie.

430
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:04,779
That's a good idea. I sleep
and when you wake up, I sleep again.

431
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:07,642
Haven't you forgotten something?

432
00:46:09,415 --> 00:46:13,004
Haven't you forgotten something?

433
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:14,814
Oh...
Good night, Ollie.

434
00:46:14,849 --> 00:46:16,198
I'm sorry, Ollie.

435
00:46:16,233 --> 00:46:17,779
Get up and put that candle out.

436
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:22,347
- But you said I could...
- Go ahead, selfish.

437
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,130
Ollie.

438
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:39,744
Ollie.

439
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,973
Ollie.

440
00:46:43,362 --> 00:46:47,453
- Are you awake yet?
- No!

441
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,588
Pardon me.

442
00:48:38,923 --> 00:48:42,505
- What is that thing?
- Look out!

443
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:59,255
Open the window
and we'll drive him out.

444
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:31,639
This morning I'm going to prepare
a magnificent seagull egg omelette with fine herbs.

445
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,999
Omelette...
Bah!

446
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,919
Today I'm going to draw the plans
for a splendid villa with a big roman bath.

447
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,319
What are you going to do, Ollie?

448
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:43,159
I'm going to give you, fellas, a piece of my mind.
Chérie's a nice girl, isn't she?

449
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,541
- Exquisite!
- Charming!

450
00:49:44,542 --> 00:49:45,737
Pretty too!

451
00:49:45,772 --> 00:49:46,959
And we're all friends, aren't we?

452
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,559
- Of course.
- Naturally.

453
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:52,319
Well, I make a motion that we never let a woman
come between us. Agreed?

454
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,999
- Of course.
- I agree.

455
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,039
Now, let's get dressed.

456
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,519
- Say, Ollie, where's the sandpaper?
- Sandpaper?

457
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,326
- In that locker.
- Thank you.

458
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,959
Pardon me.

459
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,060
Thank you.

460
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,639
Pardon me.

461
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,141
Thank you.

462
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,275
Pardon me.

463
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,559
Thanks a lot.

464
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,321
Pardon me.

465
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,854
Thank you.

466
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,123
Pardon me.

467
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,689
Hey!

468
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,553
Look!

469
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,246
Hello.

470
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,199
What's the matter?

471
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,504
The cat got your tongues?

472
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:01,287
How nice you look this morning.

473
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:04,872
Come on, come on...
I want you to sit down.

474
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,960
I'll have the food on the table
in two seconds.

475
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,039
- Look! She's done clean plates!
- Even a table cloth!

476
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:32,896
- And clean napkins!
- She even swept the floor.

477
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,959
Does this belong to anybody?

478
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,370
- Never saw that guy before.
- Nobody I know.

479
00:52:52,371 --> 00:52:54,082
No.

480
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,879
It's mine.

481
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,359
It's a friend.

482
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:06,217
It's just someone I knew once.

483
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,359
I have a little surprise
which I hope you're going to like.

484
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,135
- What? Another one?
- What is it?

485
00:53:23,136 --> 00:53:26,636
A bouillabaisse!

486
00:53:26,637 --> 00:53:30,559
Tell me...
Was your boyfriend fond of bouillabaisse?

487
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,681
Oh, he loved it.

488
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:27,724
Is this the warehouse you've been building?
As warehouses go, it's a funny warehouse.

489
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,575
This is no warehouse!

490
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:56,319
It's for you.

491
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:59,679
- For me?
- Yes, for you. It sure is easy to fool you.

492
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,519
Did you really think
we were building a refrigerator?

493
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:08,623
We were afraid you'd find out,
so we put on all the decorations last night.

494
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,757
Come on in.

495
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,845
It's just lovely.

496
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:13,519
You've all been such wonderful friends.
This is the first real home I've ever had.

497
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:17,362
I'm so happy I could...

498
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:23,708
You're not content just to be a singer.
You've also got to be the comedian.

499
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:33,766
What are you playing now?
Snow white and the seven dwarves?

500
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:39,882
That's the fella in the picture
that she carries around with her.

501
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,679
Alright! You've tracked me down!
Now what?

502
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,799
You're wrong, baby.
I never tried tracking you down.

503
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:49,799
Our old friend, Dolan,
reported seeing an uncharted island.

504
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:53,639
My business here is to chart it.
My men are out there working at it now.

505
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:59,121
I suppose I should have my head examined
but I'm going to give you one more chance.

506
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:04,673
Go and pack you're things
and be down at the beach in 15 minutes.

507
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:08,959
- What for?
- I suppose you want to be rescued, don't you?

508
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,498
Not by you!

509
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,239
Lieutenant! Come right away!
We've found something!

510
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,953
OK.
I'll be right with you.

511
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,978
This is your last chance.
Are you coming?

512
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,505
No!

513
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:38,266
We'd better keep an eye on that guy.
He looks like a man who would steal our island.

514
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,559
It's uranium!
The place is loaded with it.

515
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,646
Uranium?

516
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:04,208
Which one of you, fellas,
happened to land first on this island?

517
00:58:04,243 --> 00:58:05,679
Let me handle this, fellas.

518
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,729
Why do you ask that?

519
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:09,719
Because it will determine
which nation owns the island.

520
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,581
We all own it.

521
00:58:11,616 --> 00:58:13,679
Of course, of course...
You own the island.

522
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:18,719
You're the real proprietors but
some country has got to claim sovereignty.

523
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,134
International law specifies that
an island belongs to the country

524
00:58:22,135 --> 00:58:24,359
whose citizen
was first to set foot on it.

525
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,879
- So some country can take our island?
- That's right.

526
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,959
And if that country has immigration laws?

527
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:33,439
- You'll have to abide by those laws.
- Even income tax laws?

528
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,535
Income tax laws,
inheritance taxes and sales taxes.

529
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:40,559
You know what they are trying to do?
They're trying to take our geraniums.

530
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:46,270
- That's it, exactly!
- Pardon us for just one moment!

531
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:59,559
Let's tell him that we all landed
on the island at the same time.

532
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:03,359
We can't tell a lie.
Antoine was the first to land.

533
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:06,839
- It was a terrible night and...
- Alright, alright.

534
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,999
Here's how it is.
I was the first man to set foot on this island.

535
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,199
- OK. What's your name?
- Antoine.

536
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:23,039
- Antoine what?
- Antoine Master of Cooking.

537
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,679
- Nationality?
- I haven't any!

538
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:31,559
You see, he is what as known as a stateless man.
Or in other words a misplaced person.

539
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:34,999
You see,
he's lost and he can't find himself.

540
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,653
Listen,
you've got to have a nationality.

541
00:59:36,688 --> 00:59:39,999
I explained that in every port
where I wanted to land.

542
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,199
But no country wanted to have me.

543
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,599
Every country now
will want to have you!

544
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,865
I'll go and radio the authorities
and dump it in somebody's lap.

545
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,359
So long, gentlemen.

546
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,626
- Bye, bye...
- So long, Lieutenant.

547
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,704
<i>Every hour, on the hour this station
is giving you up to the minute reports...</i>

548
01:00:05,739 --> 01:00:08,551

01:00:08,552 --> 01:00:10,191

<i>of an island that will be known
hence forth as Atoll H.</i>

552
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:20,719
<i>I beg your pardon.
As Atoll K.</i>

553
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,199
<i>After a fortnight of conferences...</i>

554
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,521
<i>The great powers

555
01:00:25,522 --> 01:00:28,199
<i>announced the appointment

556
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:31,285

557
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:35,392

558
01:00:35,427 --> 01:00:37,644
<i>and will be known as Atoll K.</i>

559
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:40,483
<i>This statement was welcomed
with relief in the world capitals.</i>

560
01:00:40,518 --> 01:00:42,826
<i>Now it has become
only a question of time</i>

561
01:00:42,827 --> 01:00:45,839
<i>before some government
raises it's flag over Atoll K.</i>

562
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,319
Some government's flag, they say.

563
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,605
Do you hear that?

564
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,603
Well...
Why don't we make a government of our own?

565
01:00:53,638 --> 01:00:57,009
Chérie's right!

566
01:00:58,006 --> 01:01:03,233
I'll write a constitution
like has never been written before.

567
01:01:04,686 --> 01:01:06,360
Sharpen this!

568
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:21,879
This will have to be a short constitution.

569
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,799
Now...

570
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,719
We...

571
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:30,319
the people of...

572
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,642
Of?

573
01:01:33,084 --> 01:01:36,269
Crusoeland...

574
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:43,839
In order to save our island,

575
01:01:43,874 --> 01:01:48,879
do hereby form a government.

576
01:01:49,303 --> 01:01:50,947
Now, what kind of government
do we want?

577
01:01:50,948 --> 01:01:52,919
Very little government
would be good, I think.

578
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,679
- Without too many laws.
- And no passports.

579
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,759
No passports.

580
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:01,047
- And no prisons.
- No prisons.

581
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,879
What?

582
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:11,919
- No taxes.
- No taxes.

583
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,279
This is getting to be
a perfect government.

584
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:18,799
And I will add...
No laws and no money.

585
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,919
And that's all we have room for.

586
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:25,559
Now, the next thing is to hold an election.
I vote for myself as President.

587
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:29,439
- And Stanley seconds the motion.
- But I'm the discoverer of our island!

588
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,159
I vote for me!
You vote for me too, don't you?

589
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,559
No, no.
Giovanni, votes only for Giovanni!

590
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:38,605
Electioneering is over!

591
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,639
Chérie.

592
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,999
Count the votes.

593
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,959
One vote for Giovanni.
One vote for Antoine.

594
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,559
One, two, three...
Three votes for Oliver Crusoe.

595
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:59,860
The President is elected
by a comfortable majority.

596
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:07,599
As President of Crusoeland,
I will now choose my cabinet.

597
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:13,519
- Chérie, you are my Vice President.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

598
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,679
Antoine,
you are my foreign minister.

599
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,039
I am very proud.

600
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:22,559
Giovanni, you are
the minister of construction.

601
01:03:22,594 --> 01:03:25,439
You couldn't have made
a better choice.

602
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,930
Well, that's that!

603
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:35,519
- What about me?
- Stanley, you are the people!

604
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,839
I don't want to be the people.

605
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,202
What do you mean,
you don't want to be the people?

606
01:03:40,237 --> 01:03:42,559
There are more of you
than there are of us!

607
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:45,399
- You mean, there's a lot of me?
- Certainly!

608
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,959
Oh, well! Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know.

609
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,639
Mr. President,
but now we will have to have a flag.

610
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:56,483
Giovanni's right.
We can't have a government without a flag.

611
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:01,839
- Can't we use this as a flag?
- That will be perfect!

612
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:08,148
- Yes, but we will need an emblem.
- Wait a second. I have an idea.

613
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,756
It's impossible
to keep this house clean.

614
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,391
Look at that.
Terrible.

615
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:04,806
See?
The dust did that.

616
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,479
- Stan, Ollie!
- What happened?

617
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,250
Looks like we're being invaded.

618
01:05:36,285 --> 01:05:39,582
What happened?
Take a look at the beach.

619
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:56,147
Under the principle of self determination,
the constitution proposed by the government,

620
01:05:56,182 --> 01:05:59,279
has been ratified by unanimous vote.

621
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:05,602
We have no alternative but to recognise
this new sovereign state, the Crusoeland.

622
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:56,384
Pardon me.

623
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,479
- Waiter, waiter!
- Antoine, more bouillabaisse.

624
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,165
- Poor Antoine.
- Poor Antoine's right.

625
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,999
- What are you having?
- You!

626
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,519
Let me go.
You can't do that.

627
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,199
They said it's a free country here.

628
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:25,706
As President of this island
I demand that you desist.

629
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:37,258
Do that again!

630
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:42,252
You keep out of this, nitwit!

631
01:07:42,287 --> 01:07:44,319
I'll have you thrown off
of this island for that!

632
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,367
Yes.
We'll have you imported!

633
01:07:46,368 --> 01:07:50,321
If I were you, my fine friends,
I wouldn't be too sure.

634
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,773
See you later.

635
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:55,279
Gentlemen.

636
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,039
I'll have him thrown off
this island if it's the last thing I do.

637
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,919
- That's not possible.
- Why not?

638
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:04,039
- Because we have no such laws.
- Yes. That would be pretty difficult.

639
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:06,338
We'd be forced
to change the constitution.

640
01:08:06,373 --> 01:08:10,136
If you want my advice Mr. President,
call a meeting of the cabinet.

641
01:08:10,171 --> 01:08:11,799
That's a good idea.
Come on.

642
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:15,189
We'll attend to that right now!

643
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:19,643
Enjoy yourself, folks.
We'll be right back.

644
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,959
It sure is quiet out there.

645
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,965
That's because I showed a firm hand
with our proclamation.

646
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:05,034
Now I'll make a tour round the island
and test the public's reaction.

647
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,834
You don't have to.
They're coming to visit you.

648
01:09:08,869 --> 01:09:11,282
They're coming to apologise.

649
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:15,011
I knew that would bring them
to their senses.

650
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:23,401
- Who wrote that?
- He did!

651
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:29,359
- I now put you under arrest!
- But he's the President.

652
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,909
He certainly is.

653
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:39,839
- Why don't you hang him?
- You have just given me an excellent idea.

654
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:45,199
You will confess everything and then
you will be hanged like gentlemen, at sunrise.

655
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,386
Thank you very much.

656
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:54,839
- What'd he say?
- Why don't you keep your big mouth shut?

657
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:58,239
- Are you going to hang her too?
- Of course not.

658
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:03,199
- What can I say, but thank you.
- I can't believe my ears.

659
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:07,119
Well, if you can't believe those ears,
you can't believe anything.

660
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,194
Put some guards around the house.

661
01:10:09,195 --> 01:10:12,847
I'll immediately go and start
a crew building a gallows.

662
01:10:12,882 --> 01:10:17,719
Oh, by the way... Now that I'm going
to be President, I'll need that outfit.

663
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:22,363
- Will you accompany me, my dear?
- But of course.

664
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:33,336
- I still can't believe my...
- Oh, shut up!

665
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:49,468
See if the guards are still out there.

666
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,904
He missed me!

667
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,359
<i>Attention!
Attention!</i>

668
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:21,559
<i>Commander in chief, geographic station Tahiti.
calling Lieutenant Frazer.</i>

669
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:26,199
<i>Report your position.
8:30 AM, wavelength 15 metres... Over.</i>

670
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:29,359
Lucky I was hired to come here
as a radio operator.

671
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,388
Without Alecto I'd be sunk.

672
01:11:31,389 --> 01:11:35,506
That reminds me.
He was just looking for you, Alecto.

673
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,522
- Where is he?
- Oh, over there.

674
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:48,959
Hello. Lieutenant Frazer.
Lieutenant Frazer!

675
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,771
Lieutenant...
For you.

676
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:55,564
Sounds like a dame.

677
01:11:55,565 --> 01:11:58,199
<i>Lieutenant Frazer.
Lieutenant Frazer!</i>

678
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:02,039
Hello, snow white.
Don't tell me the dwarves are annoying you.

679
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,412
Hello, Jack. Listen to me.
You've got to come straight away.

680
01:12:04,447 --> 01:12:07,475
They've started a revolution...
They're building a gallows...

681
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:10,503
They're going to hang everyone.
I need you! Do you hear me?

682
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,906
Change your course,
20 points to starboard.

683
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:32,249
One, two, three, four...
Let's go!

684
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,079
- Get away! Quick!
- Is this another one of your tricks?

685
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:02,039
- What do you mean, tricks?
- Sure, she's full of them.

686
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:05,359
- We go outside and the guards shoot us.
- You're wrong!

687
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:10,300
I just got rid of the guards outside.
I put a stone in my purse.

688
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:15,279
I went with Alecto only because one of us
had to remain free to save the others.

689
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,364
- What are we waiting for?
- Come on!

690
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:22,239
- No. I'm staying here.
- But we can't leave you here!

691
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,359
I've got to stay here
and send them in the other direction.

692
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:28,732
- Thank you very much, miss.
- Now hurry up! Hurry up!

693
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,634
- How did it happen?
- I haven't got time to explain!

694
01:14:55,635 --> 01:14:58,399
You've got to run
and try and catch those brutes.

695
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:01,159
Did you notice which way they went?

696
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:05,163
- That way!
- Follow me!

697
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:28,870
There they are!

698
01:15:28,905 --> 01:15:30,982
Follow me!

699
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:48,804
Hurry up!
They went this way!

700
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:02,012
Hey, look at that!

701
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,594
I think we're safe here.

702
01:16:20,629 --> 01:16:23,842
Don't you?

703
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:37,422
He must have fainted.

704
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,802
What happened?

705
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,559
Chérie!

706
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,683
It's Chérie!

707
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:12,310
Stan, answer me.
Forgive me.

708
01:17:12,345 --> 01:17:15,689
I didn't know it was you.
Please, look at me.

709
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,763
- How did you catch them?
- But I...

710
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:25,889
The girl is absolutely wonderful.
She has a stone in her bag!

711
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,408
Quick!
Get them out of here!

712
01:17:28,409 --> 01:17:31,959
We're going to give the signal
for the show to begin.

713
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:36,319
As a token of thanks for your help,
without which I would never have succeeded,

714
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:43,300
I am giving you the honour of pulling the lever
that will drop these traitors into eternity.

715
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:57,839
Alecto! Alecto!
This girl is in cahoots with the traitors!

716
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,914
- Look where he's standing.
- What are you talking about?

717
01:18:00,915 --> 01:18:04,756
She overpowered us
and let them escape!

718
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,105
I don't get it.
I've just been checking.

719
01:19:16,106 --> 01:19:19,274
We're exactly on the position
where the island stood.

720
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,239
- Oh, no!
- What do you mean, no?

721
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:32,799
- I don't want to be rescued by him!
- Why not?

722
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,759
He was too long getting here!

723
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:37,711
<i>This world of ours
is definitely no fair place</i>

724
01:19:37,712 --> 01:19:40,159
<i>but people go on living just the same.</i>

725
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:42,719
<i>Chérie Lamour is finally
marrying her Lieutenant</i>

726
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:47,119
<i>And they look forward to many years
of happily married life.</i>

727
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,463
Do you take for your wedded wife
Miss Chérie Lamour?

728
01:19:50,498 --> 01:19:52,199
OK, OK!

729
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:55,079
- I now pronounce you man and wife.
- You jilted me.

730
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:56,519
I jilted you, you say?

731
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:59,453
<i>Giovanni has gone back
to his native Italy.</i>

732
01:19:59,454 --> 01:20:04,319
<i>Instead of building marble palaces,
he'll go on forever building fences.</i>

733
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:07,559
<i>Antoine has been brought back
to the boat from which he ran away.</i>

734
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:13,159
<i>Still anxious to give up this life of wandering,
he tries once more his usual means of escape.</i>

735
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:18,763
<i>But this time he's gotten
into the wrong sort of cage.</i>

736
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,879
<i>As for our two heroes,</i>

737
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,879
<i>after all their mishaps,
they've finally gotten their inheritance.</i>

738
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:36,639
<i>Their own south sea island and there
far away from all the cares of the world,</i>

739
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:40,079
<i>they settle down
to a well earned rest.</i>

740
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:45,199
That was sure was nice of Frazer and Chérie
to land us here on our own real island.

741
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:48,439
Give us all this food and everything...

742
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:51,839
- Just like a fresh start in life.
- It certainly is.

743
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:55,815
And they're going to send us
new supplies every six months.

744
01:20:55,816 --> 01:20:58,399
At last,
all of our troubles are over.

745
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:03,639
Yes, sir. Nothing to do from now on
but eat and sleep.

746
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:08,003
And nobody to tell us
what to do.

747
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:12,559
- What are you doing here?
- What are we doing here?

748
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:14,719
This is our island!

749
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:15,839
There must be some mistake.

750
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,568
This island has been taken over by the government
for insufficient payment of inheritance taxes.

751
01:21:20,603 --> 01:21:23,408
Moreover,
you've also been fined for the delay.

752
01:21:23,443 --> 01:21:26,214
It's my duty to seize
your supplies and food.

753
01:21:26,249 --> 01:21:28,408
Take it away!

754
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:39,319
Well, here's another nice mess
you've gotten me into!

755
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:43,598
Well, I couldn't help it.
You're always blaming me for everything...
