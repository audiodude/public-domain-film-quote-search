A war?

00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,896
Do you suppose he
could be a, a spy?

161
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,157

patient I should think.

A giant? Giant? Why

I said, "there's a GIANT
ON THE BEACH!"

193
00:19:33,688 --> 00:19:35,884
Bring cables and tools.
Bring horses and mules.

194
00:19:35,949 --> 00:19:37,911
Bring snipers and clippers,
ladders and spools.

00:19:37,991 --> 00:19:40,201
Bring derricks and rigs,
and bring pulleys a jig.

Bring whatchamacallit. Little and
big. A thingamathud. A thingamajig.

197
00:19:43,821 --> 00:19:45,235
And all kinds of things
and stuff like that there.

198
00:19:45,236 --> 00:19:46,238
Follow me!

199
00:20:29,171 --> 00:20:31,230

Shh! Quiet.

204
00:21:02,115 --> 00:21:03,356
We're almost there.

205
00:21:24,185 --> 00:21:25,367
Whoa!

206
00:21:26,265 --> 00:21:28,370
Wh, where, where is it?

207
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:30,790
I don't know,

208
00:21:31,715 --> 00:21:33,459
but it was right here.

209
00:21:36,155 --> 00:21:37,155
Here?

210
00:21:37,477 --> 00:21:40,800
Oh yeah? Well where is it now?

211
00:21:41,378 --> 00:21:43,583
Well ah, ah, I
can't understand it.

212
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,554
It was right here.

213
00:21:47,114 --> 00:21:48,114
Honest.

214
00:21:49,901 --> 00:21:51,644
Giant, huh!

215
00:21:51,751 --> 00:21:54,388
Dragging us out into
the dead of the night.

216
00:21:54,424 --> 00:21:56,559
Yeah, chasing wild geese.

217
00:21:56,644 --> 00:21:59,525
Gabby must have
been seeing things.

218
00:21:59,595 --> 00:22:03,072
Maybe it just got
up and flew away.

219
00:22:04,495 --> 00:22:07,034
Yeah, and breathing fire.

220
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:12,957
Look out Gabby. Your
giant's gonna bite ya!

221
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:18,829
Hey, hey fellas, maybe
it was me he saw.

222
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:21,340
Look. I'm a giant! I'm a giant!

223
00:22:41,537 --> 00:22:42,537
Psst!

224
00:22:45,592 --> 00:22:47,078
Psst! Psst! Psst!

00:22:47,565 --> 00:22:48,190

Eh, listen.

227
00:23:38,729 --> 00:23:40,270
Oh!

228
00:23:41,847 --> 00:23:45,315
I-I... t-t-told ya

229
00:23:45,339 --> 00:23:51,055
a-a-a-a gi, a-a giant
on the b-b-b-b-beach.

230
00:23:51,101 --> 00:23:52,942
- And well, there he is.
- Eh?

231
00:23:53,626 --> 00:23:57,033
He said,"THAT'S THE THE
GIANT ON THE BEACH!"

232
00:23:57,289 --> 00:23:59,000
Shh!

233
00:23:59,377 --> 00:24:01,106
Shh!

234
00:24:01,284 --> 00:24:02,597
Shh!

235
00:24:02,643 --> 00:24:04,024
There isn't a moment to waste.

236
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:06,382
Every last man must
do all that he can.

237
00:24:06,439 --> 00:24:07,863
Work with the greatest of haste.

238
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:12,073
So bind up its hands, its
arms, its chest, its neck, its feet!

239
00:24:12,645 --> 00:24:13,786
And I'll do the rest.

240
00:24:13,861 --> 00:24:15,371
Let's go!

241
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:41,193
Quiet.

242
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,888
- Quiet.

243
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:45,818
Quiet.

244
00:24:46,136 --> 00:24:47,207
Eh?

245
00:24:49,157 --> 00:24:50,282
Oh!..

246
00:24:58,528 --> 00:25:00,749
Shh!

247
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:27,987
Careful!

248
00:26:28,931 --> 00:26:29,989
Up!

249
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:54,888
Put him there! No! No!
Here! Don't be afraid man!

250
00:26:57,139 --> 00:27:01,061
Aw! Aw! He got me! He got
me! Aw! Aw! Help! He's killing me!

251
00:27:01,101 --> 00:27:04,088

252
00:27:04,283 --> 00:27:05,374
Hey!

Well, what are you rubes
waiting for? Tie him up!

254
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:01,477
Get the wheel. Come
on, roll in the plate.

255
00:29:01,478 --> 00:29:03,678
Bring pegs to hold him. Bring
jacks, tacks, cleats, an axe.

256
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,530
All kinds of things
and stuff like that there!

257
00:29:10,106 --> 00:29:11,106

Giddy up, Susie! Giddy up!

Lower away men!

Not so fast! Not so fast!

284

Hurry up, there!

285

Slow down!

286
00:33:42,998 --> 00:33:44,459
Get the wheels past!

287
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:48,318
Phew! I don't know what they
would do around here without me!

288
00:33:55,092 --> 00:33:56,772
Oh! Ahh!

300
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,772
Your, your, your Majesty.

301
00:35:34,662 --> 00:35:35,893
Huh?

302
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,719
I've got the giant.

303
00:35:38,235 --> 00:35:41,558
The giant. Oh,

Okay. Okay.

306
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:51,358
Your Majesty, I don't
think he'd fit in here.

307
00:35:51,978 --> 00:35:56,186
Oh you don't, huh? So it's
not good enough for him, hmm?

308
00:35:56,265 --> 00:35:59,616
Well where is he?

309
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:01,951
Out there, your Majesty.

310
00:36:08,481 --> 00:36:09,876
Now, then.

311
00:36:13,114 --> 00:36:15,590
Humph! Not good enough for him!

312
00:36:36,108 --> 00:36:38,571
Well, where is he?

313
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:43,868
From here, on!

314
00:36:51,298 --> 00:36:53,805
Call out the guards,
the Army, the Navy,

315
00:36:53,868 --> 00:36:56,439
women and children
first, I'll see you later.

316
00:37:30,653 --> 00:37:33,460
Search him men.
He may be armed.

317
00:37:56,418 --> 00:37:57,418
Ow.

318
00:37:57,435 --> 00:37:58,435
Yow!

Ugh! Oh!

- Help! Put me down! Help!

331
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,285
Help! Help! Don't
eat me! Don't eat me!

332
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,457
Help! I won't taste good.
I'll give you indigestion.

333
00:39:43,927 --> 00:39:46,549
- A man. A tiny man.
- Let me go! Help! Help!

334
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:50,357
You can't do this to me.
I've got a wife and kids.

335
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,011
Millions of kids.

336
00:39:52,061 --> 00:39:55,101
Hold on there, mate.
Nobody's going to hurt you.

337

Help! Put me down! Help! Help!

338

Drop that! Drop that!

339
00:40:03,949 --> 00:40:07,461
Well, another one. Who are you?

340
00:40:08,002 --> 00:40:11,576
Who me? What?
I'm king around here.

341
00:40:11,906 --> 00:40:14,287
Guards! Guards! To the turrets!

342

346
00:40:44,139 --> 00:40:46,655
Ready!

347
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:47,804
Aim, fire. Aim, fire.

348
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:53,480
Aim!

349
00:40:52,505 --> 00:40:53,767

350

351

Want some more?
All right, let her go!

352
00:41:21,828 --> 00:41:22,828
It's Bom

353
00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:24,398
bo!

354
00:41:25,428 --> 00:41:29,003

battlements! Defend the city!

355

Get back there and fight!

358
00:41:50,649 --> 00:41:53,271
We of Blefuscu are not...

359
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,766
Afraid of anything.

360
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,779
Well, where's everyone gone?

361
00:42:13,245 --> 00:42:15,908
This is no way to
treat a harmless visitor.

362
00:42:27,502 --> 00:42:31,841
Look Gabby, we've
won! Gabby? Gabby?!

363
00:42:36,469 --> 00:42:41,642
See Gabby? They've
gone. Yes, sir. Scared stiff.

364
00:42:59,054 --> 00:43:00,328
Hello there.

365
00:43:06,058 --> 00:43:09,087
Come now, don't let
my size frighten you.

366
00:43:14,126 --> 00:43:17,637
You, your Majesty. Surely
you're not afraid of me?

367
00:43:18,044 --> 00:43:19,222
Uh-uh.

368
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:23,601
Well, good. Then let
me present myself.

369
00:43:24,136 --> 00:43:28,272
My name is Gulliver, your
Majesty. Lemuel Gulliver,

370
00:43:28,274 --> 00:43:30,150
a shipwrecked sailor.

371
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:32,276
At your service.

372
00:43:32,858 --> 00:43:36,364
Well, welcome to
Lilliput, Mr., Mr. Gulliver.

373
00:43:37,463 --> 00:43:40,910
Er,.. Mr. Gulliver, can you fight?

374
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:45,456
Well your Majesty, I
can lick anybody my size.

375
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:48,334
Ah, splendid, splendid!

376
00:43:48,817 --> 00:43:53,160
I don't think Bombo will give us any
further trouble while you're around here.

377
00:43:53,454 --> 00:43:55,044
No sir!

378
00:43:55,089 --> 00:43:58,052
He's on our side, Gabby.

379
00:43:58,905 --> 00:44:00,805
He's on our side!

380
00:44:00,852 --> 00:44:02,424
There's nothing to fear!

dare, ready to ready to, die. ♫

640
01:08:38,642 --> 01:08:42,728
♫ We're all together now.  All together now. ♫

641
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:46,243
♫ Ready to do, ready to
dare, ready to ready to, die. ♫

642
01:08:46,245 --> 01:08:48,116
♫ What do we care. ♫

643
01:09:00,122 --> 01:09:01,511
Hold on there!

644
01:09:01,841 --> 01:09:03,973
We can settle this peacefully.

645
01:09:05,566 --> 01:09:06,726
Listen!

646
01:09:07,582 --> 01:09:09,103
Hold you fire!

647
01:09:10,489 --> 01:09:12,315
Hear what I have to say.

648
01:09:33,398 --> 01:09:37,173
Bombo, order your men
to lay down their arms.

649
01:09:41,149 --> 01:09:43,262
Must I make you listen?

650
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:39,360
David, look! Gulliver's
thunder machine.

651
01:10:56,263 --> 01:10:57,879
Wait here, Glory.

652
01:10:59,685 --> 01:11:01,215
David!

653
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:08,848
The powder!

654
01:11:11,995 --> 01:11:13,144
The powder!

655
01:11:33,067 --> 01:11:33,993
Pull!

656
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:35,875
Come on! Pull!

657
01:11:36,048 --> 01:11:37,384
Pull!

658
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:15,081
David!

659
01:12:22,187 --> 01:12:25,132
Poor, poor,
foolish little people.

660
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:27,309
Look what you've done.

661
01:12:27,457 --> 01:12:30,847
Now go ahead! Break your
nutshell heads over your songs!

662
01:12:31,872 --> 01:12:34,892
But did you have to break
Glory's heart, King Little,

663
01:12:35,295 --> 01:12:37,836
because your
thoughtless and selfish?

664
01:12:37,916 --> 01:12:43,818
And you Bombo, O mighty
warrior, what have you won?

665
01:12:45,902 --> 01:12:47,864
You were too stubborn to think,

666
01:12:48,006 --> 01:12:52,201
too busy quarreling to lend ear to the
harmony that might have been yours.

667
01:12:57,214 --> 01:12:59,876
But now in your
sorrow and despair,

668
01:13:00,127 --> 01:13:03,671
perhaps you will listen to your
songs as they might be sung.
