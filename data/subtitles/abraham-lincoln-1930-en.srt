00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,514
Tom Lincoln!

2
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,592
- Boy or gal?
- 'T aint fur enough along yit fer a tag.

3
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,192
- How's Nancy standin' it?
- She's a-prayin'

4
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,953
It's a boy?

5
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,759
It's as long as an eel!

6
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,835
Shucks, he'never
amount to nothin' nohow!

7
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,558
Is he purty?

8
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,436
Homely as a mud fence!

9
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,675
What do you 'low
to call him, Aunty?

10
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,791
Abraham.

11
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,855
There he is. Ugliest, laziest,
smartest man in New Salem.

12
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,591
- Ain't yuh, Abe?
- I don't mind my face, I'm behind it.

13
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,870
It's the people
in front that get jarred.

14
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,110
Whip any man in shoo
leather I At least, I hope he can.

15
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,950
Offut does the braggin'
I do the runnin'

16
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,231
You better dust off
them shoes then, stranger,

17
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,874
'cause you ain't here for long.

18
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,231
Well, I was aimin'
to settle here awhile.

19
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,797
- This ain't no peaceable town.
- Well, I'm a peaceable man.

20
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,712
Wait till
Jack Armstrong gets hold o' yuh.

21
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,713
He'll throw yuh out
that door like yuh was a sack o' meal!

22
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,918
- Big fellow?
- No bigger'n you,

23
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,949
but he's champeen o' this country
he ain' never been licked.

24
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,078
And when he sees you...

25
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,919
Folks can't even spit
without his sayso.

26
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,957
Chuck me outa that door, you say?

27
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,673
Like a sack o' meal.

28
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,559
Well, that's a pretty long
chuck for a peaceful man.

29
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,759
Whar be he?

30
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,469
Now, Armstrong,
cain't you leave us be?

31
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,910
Yuh just busted up
old man Simpson's place

32
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,640
and scattered
his new place all over the county.

33
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,676
Man, don't you ever rest?

34
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,789
Whare be he?
That yellow-livered baboon from Indianny!

35
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,870
I come from Indianny,
but not that part.

36
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,639
Well, get down!

37
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,318
Let's see what bones
I wants to crack first!

38
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,068
Get a good hold, Jack!

39
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,559
Come on,
an' get yer neck broke!

40
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,108
This is the neatest
wrestle you've ever had.

41
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,355
Go to him, Champ!

42
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,551
- Get 'in, Jack!

43

45
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,189

Offut, on the Champeen!

46
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,317
- Watch 'im, boy!

47
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,795
- Watch 'im, boy!
- Come on, git 'im!

48
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,115
- Come on, git 'im!
- Git 'im!

49
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,638
Watch 'im, boy!

50
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,915
Come on, git 'im!

51
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,634
Now, come on, all o' you.

52
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,392
I'm the big tuck of thisn lick!

53
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,953
Yuh are, eh?

54
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,308
Hold on, boys!

55
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,239
He throwed me fair.

56
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,313
What's your name?

57
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,913
Lincoln,...
Abraham Lincoln.

58
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,756
Well, we're goin' to make yuh one of us.

59
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,231
Come on, boys, I'll set 'em up!

60
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,873
It's about time you set 'em up.

61
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,315
Let's have some o'
that rattlesnake bite.

62
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,633
He said he was a peaceful man.

63
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,877
He meant peaceful like a wildcat!

64
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,433
Yeh, that's what he thought.

65
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,238
Looks like good corn liquor.

66
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,112
That is corn liquor.

67
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,112
Come on, Abe. Where's yours?

68
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,358
No, I don't care much for it.

69
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,357
Come on, have a drink, Abe.

70
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,231
Well, I'll drink
if you'll take it like I do.

71
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,789
How's that?

72
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,590
Lift up the barrel,
and drink it outa the bung.

73
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,908
Well, I'll show you boys.

74
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,674
Maybe can, maybe can't.
Try it, anyway.

75
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,873
Whew!

76
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,197
He's the strongest man in Salem!

77
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,351
I told you he was the strongest man.

78
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,233
I've seen him lift
500 pounds in each hand.

79
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,276
- Ain't yuh drinkin?
- No.

80
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,958
- Teetotal?
- No.

81
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,874
Reformer?

82
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,749
No, I don't
regulate nobody's drinkin'

83
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,754
just my own.

84
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,560
I've seen him lift a thousand...

85
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,432
- In this sense,-
- the term "law" -

86
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,559
- includes any edict,-
- decree, order,-

87
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,633
- ordinance,-
- statute, resolutión,-

88
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,033
rule, etcetera. -

89
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,749
¡Uff!, etcetera...

90
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,869
Well, my old Daddy
taught me how to work,

91
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,877
but he never
taught me how to like it.

92
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,119
I reckon I better
keep on with the lesson.

93
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,828
I'd rather keep on
with something else.

94
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,831
You made a bad bargain
making me the professor.

95
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,390
Well he told me about that too.

96
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,390
He said:
"When you make a bad bargain,

97
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,118
hug it all the tighter".

98
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,958
But he didn't mean
this kind of a bargain.

99
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,314
Well, don't you like it,
Ann, when I hold you tight?

100
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,399
I guess every girl sorta likes that...

101
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,232
Now, Abe, what is law?

102
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:20,039
Well, professor, law is a rule
of human conduct governing

103
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,554
Whoa!

104
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,594
Abe, I'ain't payin' you no forty
cents a day to spark a pretty gal!

105
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,640
Well, Uncle Jimmie,
I don't charge nothing extra for it

106
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,028
just throw it in.

107
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,872
I'm expectin'
a sight of rails cut of you.

108
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,597
He's the best
rail-splitter in the country.

109
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,674
He'll be more than a rail-splitter.

110
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,712
How old are you, Uncle Jimmie?

111
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,359
Oh nearin' forty.

112
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,277
I'll get you out forty
more rails than you expected.

113
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,915
Giddap! Maybe you'd better
make it nearin' seventy!

114
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,952
Now, Abe,
your professor needs a seat

115
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,918
where's there's more law
and less temptatión.

116
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,036
Oh, Abe! Ohhh!

117
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,036
Ohhhh!

118
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,071
- Are you all right, Anne?
- I think so.

119
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,198
- Are you hurt?
- My legs are still on me.

120
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,078
Scared me worse than it did you.

121
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,953
Did it, Abe?

122
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:53,876
You know, Anne, if anything happened
to you, I don't think I could live.

123
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,788
Funny, Abe, I feel the same about you.

124
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,318
You taught me how to love.

125
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,109
Have I taught you to like it?

126
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:22,630
In the gloaming, oh, my darling,-

127
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:31,237
When the lights are dim and low,-

128
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,950
And the quiet shadows falling. -

129
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:46,239
Softly come and softly go. -

130
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,632
It's awful nice this time of day.

131
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,873
Yes, Abe.

132
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,550
Can I tell you
a sort of a story, Anne?

133
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,150
Why of course, Abe.

134
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,318
Well, there was
a town in lllinois called...

135
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,588
called...

136
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,796
- New Salem?
- Yeh, that's it.

137
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,035
And in that town lived
the prettiest girl in the worid.

138
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,953
What was her name?

139
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,559
Anne Rutledge.

140
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,553
Oh, Abe...

141
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,038
What I'd like
to find out about that girl is,

142
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,799
she ever take a little time off
to think about gettin' married?

143
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,112
Well, maybe.

144
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,512
'Cause there's an Abe Lincoln
hanging around that's a pretty good catch.

145
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,473
What's he like?

146
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,870
Oh, he's a big merchant,
owner of three stores all bankrupt.

147
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,119
Well, is he handsome?

148
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,591
His pa said that Abe
had been cut out with an axe.

149
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,876
Politician too, I hear.

150
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,558
Yes, he's got less property
and owes more debts

151
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,830
than anybody
ever running for the legislature.

152
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,796
Oh, Abe, you'll do all
right when you get started.

153
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,632
There's something I'd like to start
right now if I thought I could finish it.

154
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,719
You know, Anne, I...

155
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,430
I've always done a lot of dreamin'

156
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,955
and lately it seems when I dream,

157
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,475
your face gets mixed up in it.

158
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,072
Does it really, Abe?
Tell me about the mixin'

159
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,156
I feel as though I'm going to be
seeing your face till the day I die.

160
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,551
'Course I know that would be pretty hard
for you to have to look at my face that long.

161
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,670
Everybody to their own opinión

162
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,559
Meaning?

163
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,473
I think...

164
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:00,790
it's the dearest, kindest,
most beautiful face in the whole worid!

165
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,232
Oh, Anne...
Anne...

166
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,792
I know
that's just flattery but I love it.

167
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,712
You know
I feel like little Jimmie Watkins,

168
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,070
he got a hunk of gingerbread
the other day and says:

169
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,437
"I guess there's nobody
likes ginger bread like I does and

170
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,953
gets so little of it".

171
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,273
Oh, Abe!

172
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,193
Anne, will you...

173
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,799
will you marry me?

174
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,799
I mean, of course when I...

175
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,759
when I...
get out of debt and can support you?

176
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,238
Well, you know, Abe,
I've intended to for a long while

177
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,674
that is, of course, if you asked me.

178
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,629
You... you mean?

179
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,034
Yes, Abe, you've got your gingerbread.

180
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,798
Oh, Anne!

181
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:24,069
Will you think of me and love me-

182
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:35,034
As you did once long ago?-

183
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,354
How is she, Doctor?

184
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,194
Pretty bad.

185
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,472
She's been asking for you, Abe.

186
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,233
I came as soon as I could.

187
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,833
I had the fever pretty bad myself.

188
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,638
I've got to tell you the truth, Abe,

189
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,078
It's hopeless...

190
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,759
perhaps by tomorrow...

191
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,912
no longer.

192
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,958
I'm so glad you came, Abe.

193
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,037
Are you all right now?

194
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,954
Now, don't bother about me, dear.
I'm all right now.

195
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,190
I know the truth, dear.
It's good-bye.

196
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,719
No, no, Anne dear,
you're not going to leave me!

197
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,668
I won't let you!

198
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,115
We must be brave, dear...

199
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,278
Don't take me away!
Don't take me away!

200
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,313
It's so dark and lonesome going!

201
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,233
Anne, you mustn't let go!

202
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,118
If they'd sing,
I wouldn't be so afraid.

203
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,189
In the sweet by and by,-

204
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:52,232
We shall meet on that beautiful shore. -

205
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,559
We will meet there, dear.

206
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,476
Oh... I love you so!

207
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,117
I love you so!

208
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,714
Feeling any better, Bowling?

209
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,833
No, not much.

210
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,432
I'll tell you, Doctor,
he's just like a sick child...

211
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,632
He was lost for five days
before we found him.

212
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,125
Yeh, I know.

213
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,188
We took his pocket-knife away from him,
we were so afeard something might happen.

214
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,077
Good gracious,
Abe, you're looking better!

215
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,672
No use trying to talk to him,

216
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,878
he just cain't answer.

217
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,117
If we could only think of something
that would just bring him back.

218
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,116
I guess time's the only thing.

219
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,109
Why should the spirit of mortal be proud,

220
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,672
like a swift-fleeting meteor,
fast-flying cloud?

221
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,028
Flash of the lightning,
break of the wave,

222
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,837
He passes from life
to his rest in the grave.

223
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,591
My goodness, Mary Todd, just think!

224
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,111
He'll be here in a few minutes
the catch of America!

225
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,476
Stephen A. Douglas!

226
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,476
Just think of being his wife!

227
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,279
Don't be in such a hurry, sister.

228
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,198
I'm not even engaged
much less married.

229
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,598
But if he should propose?

230
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,557
How do I know he's going further
than anyone else in Springfield?

231
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,910
When I pick a husband, sister,
I'll pick a man!

232
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,878
But I don't know
what you're talking about.

233
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,359
A lot of people seem to think
a man named Abraham Lincoln

234
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,711
is going even further than Mr. Douglas.

235
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,474
Why, Mary Todd, have you gone crazy?

236
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,949
You compare an unknown cornfield lawyer

237
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,749
with a brilliant cultured gentleman
like Stephen A. Douglas!

238
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,711
Why, if you just saw
the two of them together.

239
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,239
Oh, he's here!

240
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,313
Mr. Douglas is down in the parlor
and he's asking for Mary!

241
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,310
Now, Mary, you must be
very careful, and remember

242
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,312
he doesn't like to have giris too bold.

243
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,671
Don't get so excited,
sister, and don't hurry me.

244
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,158
I'll take care of myself.

245
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,997
You glide through the dance
like grace itself Miss Todd.

246
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,959
Always the politician, Mr. Douglas!

247
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,593
Who wouldn't be a politician
with so fair a constituent to win?

248
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,557
- Exquisite!
- The fan, Mr. Douglas?

249
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,989
No, the fair owner herself.

250
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,913
- May I look?
- Sr. Douglas...

251
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,036
I wonder if you'd do me a great favor?

252
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,994
Yes.

253
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,035
Then, pray present me
to this young lady.

254
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,193
- Miss Todd?
- Yes?

255
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,237
May I present one
of the leading lawyers of Springfield

256
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,193
Mr. Abraham Lincoln?

257
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,879
Mr. Lincoln!

258
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,397
Miss Todd I wonder
if you'd honor me with the next dance?

259
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,312
Why,... why...

260
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,552
I'd be delighted.

261
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,230
Miss Todd, you thought my face was funny,

262
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,993
and the way I dressed even funnier,

263
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,514
but the joke's on you.

264
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,399
Why, I don't understand.

265
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,078
Wait till you dance with me.

266
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,157
Have you got the license, Mr. Lincoln?

267
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,188
Well, she got you.

268
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,148
I knew she would
when she started out the first time for you.

269
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,668
Now, Billie, don't bother me.

270
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,836
I'm going to be married
and I'm scared to death.

271
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,194
Oh, don't be alarmed.

272
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,436
There's many a bite
that's worse than a bride's.

273
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,391
But, Billie,
that woman scares me.

274
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,834
She's even got the ridiculous idea
that I could get to be president.

275
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,956
Oh, don't take that seriously.

276
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,118
Every spunky girl thinks
that her husband ought to be president.

277
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,556
I know, Billie,
but it's a pity to fool her.

278
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,473
And she's a fine woman,

279
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,910
smart as pepper and pretty too.

280
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,878
She'll be a great help to you, Mr. Lincoln,

281
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,111
but you've got to keep
climbing with her.

282
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,876
Yes... yes, I know.

283
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,036
I've got the best supper
you've ever tasted

284
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,033
and the cake...

285
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,033
wait till you see that cake!

286
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,117
What can have happened
to Mr. Lincoln? It's long after the...

287
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,310
He would be late at his own wedding.

288
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,548
Now, never mind, Mary,

289
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,194
if he doesn't come soon,
I'll send John after him.

290
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,952
But he's hours late already!

291
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,468
Think of that!

292
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,068
Sister, calm yourself.

293
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,191
For heaven's sakes,
you've got to hurry!

294
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,873
Billie, you... you go ahead.
You go on over and I'll come later.

295
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,271
I doubt if there's a word in the
dictionary that could tell how I feel!

296
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,639
Billie, what does a man do
if his head's all right

297
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,319
but his legs are cowardly?

298
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,873
My cure is to get drunk.

299
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,718
My legs are too frightened
to pay any attentión to liquor.

300
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,952
I'll go ahead and
tell them that you're coming.

301
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,474
Anne!

302
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,869
Anne!

303
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,388
Anne!

304
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,474
We looked, everywhere,
tort we can't find him.

305
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,955
No, can't find him...
not at the office.

306
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,639
What on earth happened to him?

307
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,751
He was in a terrible
state when I left him.

308
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,231
He was so frightened and upset.
I imagine he just ran away.

309
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,792
Ran away... from me!
On our weddin' day!

310
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,194
Now sistern dear...

311
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,554
Don't 'sister' me!

312
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,794
Can you imagine! That's what a Todd gets
for engagin' herself to a country baboon!

313
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,554
- Listen, dear, you mustn't...
- You may as well all go home!

314
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,236
You hear me?
You may as well all go home!

315
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,788
Not goin' to be any weddin' here.

316
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,558
You can all go home
as far as I'm concerned!

317
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,797
But this is so distressing!

318
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,796
You certainly are a matchmaker

319
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,073
to reconcile those two after
what happened two years ago.

320
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,878
We all like Mr. Lincoln,

321
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,714
and Mary is just
the girl to push him along.

322
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,634
Oh, Mary, how sweet you look!

323
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,034
What a lovely dress!

324
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,470
Yes, and so becoming to her too.

325
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,718
Maybe that's Mr. Lincoln now.

326
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,870
Julia it all seems so strange
having things end this way.

327
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,437
It's just as it should end. You and
Mr. Lincoln will make a great man.

328
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,351
Good morning, Mr. Lincoln.

329
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,114
Good morning.

330
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,919
Come, my dear
we'll leave the happy pair alone.

331
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,389
Good morning, Mary.

332
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,396
I,... I...

333
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,630
Mary, you don't have
to bother about me any more.

334
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,036
I think I've settled down at last.

335
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,192
I hope I can make
your future all you desire.

336
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,795
We'll say no more about it, Mr. Lincoln.

337
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,111
I really think, after all, you need me.

338
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,119
You'll need a lot of patience
to put up with me, Mary,

339
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,909
but if anyone can do it,
I'm sure you're the one.

340
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,388
Oh, Mary!

341
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,150
Douglas is a prize speaker,

342
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,035
but just wait till old Abe
gets ahold of him on slavery!

343
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,634
You're crazy!

344
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,673
Lincoln has no more chance of beating
Douglas for Senate than I have.

345
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,556
He only went to school for three months.

346
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,192
There must be no issue of slavery.

347
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,873
We must face the facts.

348
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:26,596
I'll run Mr. Lincoln out of this campaign.

349
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,391
I will not throw mud.

350
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:49,234
Let each State mind its own business
and this Republic can exist forever...

351
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,551
divided into free and slave states.

352
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:11,957
We will not allow
the extensión of slavery to any State.

353
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,713
We will not allow
the secessión of any State.

354
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:29,074
Above all and before all,
the Unión must be preserved.

355
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,596
A house divided
against itself must fall!

356
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,755
- Douglas elected!-
- Hurrah for Douglas!-

357
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,755
- Douglas elected!-
- Hurrah for Douglas!-

358
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:04,670
- Douglas elected!-
- Hurrah for Douglas!-

359
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,189
Mary...

360
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,239
I'm home, Mary.

361
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,070
You must be tired, Mr, Lincoln.

362
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,754
Sit down.

363
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,591
You just ait right here.
I'll get your supper for you in a minute.

364
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,513
Billy, I feel like
the little boy who stubbed his toe.

365
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,478
It hurt too bad to laugh,
and he was too big to cry.

366
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,992
I'm fifty years old, Billy,
and a failure in everything.

367
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,593
If I died today,
nobody'd ever know I'd lived.

368
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,074
Come in.

369
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,513
Mr. Lincoln,
I want you to meet Mr. Pell

370
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,157
one of the most important
men in Eastern politics.

371
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,673
- I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Pell.
- I'm honored, indeed, Mr. Lincoln.

372
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,434
- Meet my partner, Mr, Herndon.
- How do you do, Mr. Herndon?

373
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,709
Happy to meet you, sir.

374
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,076
- Won't you sit down, gentlemen?
- Thank you.

375
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:58,271
Mr. Lincoln, your campaign against
Douglas has made you a national figure.

376
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,119
I'm here to ask you if you will consider
being the Republican party's candidate

377
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,078
for the presidency.

378
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,033
Did you say a failure in everything?

379
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,431
- A telegram for you, Mr. Fell.
- Oh thank you.

380
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,714
Mr. Lincoln, you know
ever since John Brown's raid,

381
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,796
the South has been infuriated,
the East on the verge of revolt,

382
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,275
and now New York
threatens to quit the Unión.

383
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,271
No, no New York mustn't do that.

384
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,435
We must keep the front door on the hinge.
There can be no secessión.

385
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,155
The Unión must be preserved.

386
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:54,799
The crisis is at hand, Mr. Lincoln,
and we believe you are the man.

387
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:04,398
Gentlemen,
I feel deeply grateful.

388
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,552
Paw, Maw says if you don't come on home,
you won't get no supper.

389
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,394
"I have another crisis; the soup and
the country are boiling over together!"

390
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,318
Maw's boiling too!

391
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,315
It needs deep consideratión.

392
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,989
Well, Mr. Lincoln,
mayn't we meet you at our hotel later?

393
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,836
- I'll be there within the hour?
- Thank you.

394
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,152
Come on, Paw, we're hungry.

395
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,272
They've started it.
This is gonna mean war!

396
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,152
This darkio saw it himself.

397
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,878
Brown and a gang of Abolxitionists
have captured the armory at Harper's Ferry!

398
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,358
They're arming the slaves
to rise up and murder us all.

399
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,160
They gived us all rifles.

400
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,594
And what'd you do with yours?

401
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:17,796
What'd I do? I trowed it down,
and I say, 'Feet, you travel'

402
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,998
- They can't invade Virginia.
- No!

403
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,760
Boys, go home and git your guns.

404
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,154
What's all this talk about guns?

405
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,958
This thing has gone far enough.

406
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,913
We'll be murdered
in our beds by our own slaves.

407
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,356
Pardon me, ladies,
while I find out about this desecratión.

408
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,869
- John Brown, eh?
- Abolitionists!

409
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,229
It's an outrage!

410
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,271
Outrage isn't the word.

411
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:46,754
I'll shoot on sight every Abolitionist
who dares defile the soil of old Virginia.

412
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,273
- Who's he?
- That's the actor, John Wilkes Booth.

413
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,750
He can't act
but the women don't know it.

414
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,392
All right, men, get your guns
and we'll meet at the square!

415
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,270
At the square!

416
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,796
Can't say much for her dispositión!

417
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,393
Hush! She may hear you.

418
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,949
Soldiers, indeed!
They can't even carry trunks.

419
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,430
Here you no, the stupid-looking one

420
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,598
put that over there...
and you... idiot

421
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,194
don't look at me like
a duck in a thunderstorm!

422
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,710
Hurry... hurry!
Will you put them in there?

423
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,276
I never saw such a lot of incompetents.

424
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,194
And as for you with the whiskers,
I told you to put it in there.

425
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,638
Oh, is it going to take forever?

426
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,231
Thank heavens, that's the last!

427
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,554
Imbeciles!

428
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,839
Well, Mary, we're here.

429
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,869
Thanks to me! If it wasn't for my advice,
you'd be out in Oregon, chopping trees.

430
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,510
Yes, you're always right, Mary.

431
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,315
I've found out one thing, Lincoln.

432
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,709
Servants here are no better
than they are in Springfield.

433
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,034
This place
hasn't been cleaned in a year.

434
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,070
Why, Mr. President!

435
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,548
Huh?

436
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,919
Then we agree that the situatión
of our country is ominous.

437
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,991
- Most alarming.
- Certainly.

438
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,789
We agree that we must yield
to the demands of the South

439
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,479
and evacuate Fort Sumter.

440
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,231
- Absolutely.
- It's the only solutión.

441
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,799
That must be done.

442
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,271
We agree that our President
must be firmly guided by us.

443
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:21,472
That we must make every effort
to control his inexperienced judgment.

444
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,556
- We certainly must.
- Yes.

445
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,634
Gentlemen...

446
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,716
- Mr. President.
- Good morning, Mr. President.

447
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,154
Thank you, Hay.

448
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,873
Thank you, gentlemen...

449
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:25,796
I will shoulder all responsibilities.
The relief shall go to Fort Sumter.

450
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,198
That means war.

451
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,552
Mr. Seward, I am a man of peace,

452
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,277
but the Unión shall be preserved.

453
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,877
Seventy-five thousand...

454
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,233
It might be difficult
to get that many volunteers.

455
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:21,518
- Glory, glory Hallelujah,-
- Glory, glory Hallelujah!-

456
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:29,878
- Glory, glory Hallelujah!-
- His soul is marching on!-

457
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:38,759
- Glory, glory Hallelujah,-
- Glory, glory Hallelujah!-

458
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,710
Glory, glory Hallelujah!-

459
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,634
- I wish I was in Dixie,-
- Hooray! Hooray!-

460
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,515
- In Dixieland I'll take my stand-
- To live and die in Dixie. -

461
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:11,599
- Away, away, away down South in Dixie,-
- Away, away, away down South in Dixie. -

462
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,869
- I wish I was in Dixie,-
- Hooray! Hooray!-

463
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:36,033
- In Dixieland I'll take my stand-
- To live and die in Dixie. -

464
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:43,590
- Away, away, away down South in Dixie,-
- Away, away, away down South in Dixie. -

465
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:02,388
President, the people demand a victory,
and we've got to take Richmond.

466
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,196
The country is discouraged.
We must do something.

467
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,268
That reminds me of a story...

468
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,479
about a man building
a boat to cross a river.

469
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,311
He got impatient
building the boat and started swimming.

470
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,473
Well, sir, what happened?

471
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,794
He drowned.

472
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,468
We've got to be careful
not to drown this country.

473
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,798
Ready here!
Ready here!

474
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,434
- Quartermaster General.
- Yes, sir.

475
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,039
Ready here!
Ready here!

476
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,150
- Ready here!
- Sergeant, I'm going out.

477
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,791
- How did you make out?
- Make out?

478
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,553
He darned near kissed me.

479
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,238
- Who?
- The Secretary of War.

480
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,472
We're just licking
the tar out of thorn all along the line.

481
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,314
- Who's next?
- I am.

482
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,318
I hope it's for the President.
I'd like to sec his face

483
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,754
when he gets the good news.

484
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,390
Ready here! Commissary.

485
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,831
For General Scott.
Marked private.

486
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,348
Rush it it's victory!

487
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,872
General Scott, what news?

488
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,350
We're winning, sir. I'm sure of it.

489
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,430
- I wish...
- Come in.

490
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,433
Rebel resistance broken at Bulll Run,-

491
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,356
our army sweeping everything before it. -

492
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:56,274
President, if we can
capture Richmond now,

493
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,431
it means the end of the war.

494
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,353
- Ah, thank God.
- And you, sir...

495
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,555
this victory will silence
your enemies forever

496
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,595
and you will be
the greatest president in our history.

497
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,036
It doesn't matter
what they think of me, General.

498
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,112
- We will have saved the Unión.
- Yes.

499
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,795
General, would you mind
letting me have that telegram?

500
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,950
I'd like to show it
to Mrs. Lincoln myself.

501
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,549
Why, certainly, not, Mr. President.

502
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:32,115
And would you mind
not calling me 'Mr. President'..

503
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,513
just Lincoln.

504
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,715
All right, Lincoln.

505
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,354
Ready here!
Headquarters!

506
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,990
Sergeant, all messages
for General Scott, hold.

507
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,798
All messages for General Scott hold.

508
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,997
All messages for General Scott hold.

509
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,669
Attentión! Commanding officer.

510
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,354
At ease!

511
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,714
Ready here!

512
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,229
Bad news?
Give it to me.

513
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,471
Attentión the President!

514
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,474
At ease!

515
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,150
Well, General, what news now?

516
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,912
And the first reports?

517
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,871
Over-confidence.

518
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,911
Yes, I should have known.

519
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,555
Impossible to reform lines. -

520
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,591
The men are a confused mob,-

521
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,917
entirely demoralized. -

522
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:58,399
You must make every effort
to save Washington.

523
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,268
- ¡1!
- ¡2!

524
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,714
- ¡3!
- ¡4!

525
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,869
- ¡1!

526
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,194

527
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,469
- ¡1!

528
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,794
- ¡3!

529
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,228
- ¡1!
- ¡2!

530
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,953
Battalion!

531
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,873
On right into line, March!

532
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,354
Company, halt!

533
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,914
Left turn!

534
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,079
Right turn!

535
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,634
Halt!

536
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,197
First Company, right by fours.

537
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,394
Halt!

538
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,153
Forward!

539
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,360
Halt!

540
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,958
Forward!

541
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,751
Well, they're gathering.

542
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,754
The reserves are gathering, sir.

543
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,474
- How many regulars can we muster?
- About five thousand.

544
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,317
- Volunteers?
- Doubtful, sir.

545
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,392
Can we hold Washington?

546
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,994
We'll do our best sir.

547
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,479
Mr. Hay, is it true
we have to get out of Washington?

548
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,794
It is very serious, madam.

549
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,600
For heaven's sake,
what sort of an army have we anyhow?

550
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,392
They did the best
they could, Mrs. Lincoln.

551
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,913
They might have considered us.

552
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,996
It'll take forever
to get those trunks packed.

553
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,879
I'm sorry, madam, for all of us.

554
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,113
Mr. Lincoln, I hear we're leaving.

555
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,996
Just a moment, Mary, please.

556
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,869
After all the trouble we had getting here,

557
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,118
I must say we've had a very short stay.

558
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,635
Mary, I've hung up my hat right here,

559
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,718
and here it stays till
they knock it off with a bayonet.

560
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,717
From now on, Mary,
I'm going to run this war.

561
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,955
March! Halt!

562
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,952
Headquarters,
Post Number Four.

563
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,393
Halt! Guard.

564
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,432
Forward March!

565
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,719
Counsel of the accused,

566
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,628
have you nothing further
to say in defense of the prisoner?

567
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,035
The court finds you guilty
and the sentence death.

568
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,389
- Just a minute.
- The President... attentión!

569
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,515
You must pardon me,
gentlemen, for this intrusión.

570
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,071
I overheard one of our soldiers
sentenced to death.

571
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,239
Yes, Mr. President.
A bad example of cowardice and desertión.

572
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:43,594
Well, young man, tell me about it.

573
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,955
I think the findings
of the court were just, sir.

574
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,592
That all you have to say?

575
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,390
Sire, it was our first big battle.

576
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,316
We were trying to take a stone wall.

577
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,350
We'd been trying,
it seems, for years...

578
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,748
Go on.

579
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,960
Finally, though, we got there.

580
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,714
I was fighting bayonets.

581
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,079
We were all crazy...

582
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,193
on top of the wall...

583
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,229
Yes?

584
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:24,670
There was my boyhood chum,
looking up at me from the ground.

585
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:32,389
Not alive,
we had killed him a long time ago,

586
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,195
but I knew him.

587
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,954
And then?

588
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,957
I guess I went really crazy, sir.

589
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,629
That's all.

590
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,189
The captain reports
that you threw your rifle away.

591
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,638
Yes, sir. That must be right, sir.

592
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,037
Making excuses, Colton?

593
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,713
No, sir only...

594
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,192
get it over with, quick!

595
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,872
Hanging, killing, blood.

596
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,314
I'm tired.

597
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,188
But my generals are right,
we must maintain discipline.

598
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,869
That's all.

599
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,668
Wait a minute.

600
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,628
Bring that young man back.

601
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,034
I have it!

602
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,158
- It's a leg case.
- I beg your pardon, sir?

603
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,831
Leg case... yes, yes,

604
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,192
my shelves are full of them,
but not quite like this one.

605
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,989
If the Lord Almighty
gives a man a cowardly pair of legs,

606
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,873
and that man gets frightened,

607
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,073
he can't help his legs
running away with him, can he?

608
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,951
Young man, I'm going to pardon you.

609
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,871
Go back and do your duty.

610
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:24,390
Oh, I will, sir! I will!

611
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,993
I'm trusting you.

612
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,034
Well, Senator?

613
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,230
Mr. President, my state of New York

614
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,074
is crying out
against this endless slaughter.

615
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,713
And mine, sir.

616
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:51,631
They're holding services here today
for those who were sacrificed,

617
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,713
as they are everywhere.

618
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,350
From the East to the West, sir.

619
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,919
It can't go on, sir.

620
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,275
New England,the West,

621
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:08,960
the entire country are in mourning
for this useless waste of lives.

622
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,994
Let the Southern States
go there wat, Mr. President,

623
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,669
and we will go ours.

624
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,638
But I tell you, Mr. President...

625
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,555
- ... out of the wilderness,-
- out of the wilderness. -

626
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,759
- Old Abe Lincoln-
- came out of the wilderness,-

627
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,912
down in lllinois. -

628
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,645
Daddy, mother won't let me stay up.

629
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,319
She wants me to go to bed,
and I don't want to.

630
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,830
Don't you think it's time
for little boys to be in bed, Tad?

631
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,317
- But I want to stay with you.
- But your mother?

632
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,552
If you say so, she can't make me.

633
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,159
You're the President.

634
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,315
You're the only person in the country
who thinks I should have any authority.

635
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,037
- Run along now.
- No.

636
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:07,313
I want to stay with you.
Please, can't I, daddy?

637
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,798
No, we're very busy here now, Tad.
Run along.

638
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,719
All right, daddy.

639
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,512
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

640
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,079
Sleep tight.

641
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,589
Goodnight...

642
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,558
Gentlemen,
don't you suppose my heart bleeds

643
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,718
for all the sorrows
this war has brought upon us?

644
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,431
Do you suppose there is a human being
who wants peace more than I do.

645
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,229
But we want lasting peace,

646
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,793
and we can have that only
by preserving the Unión.

647
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,593
And, gentlemen...

648
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,553
the Unión is going to be preserved!

649
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:17,631
- And by virtue of the power,-
- and for the purpose aforesaid,-

650
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:22,638
- I do order and declare-
- that all persons held as slaves -

651
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,555
- within said designated states-
- and parts of states-

652
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,676
- are henceforward-
- and forever shall be... -

653
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,389
free. -

654
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:52,916
Well, gentlemen, it is done.

655
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,476
- More bad news, Hay?
- I'm afraid there is.

656
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,749
Well, let's have it.

657
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,115
The Secret Service
reports that there are 600.000

658
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,795
pperheads in the North and under cath and arme

659
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,279
- To get me?
- Yes.

660
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,192
That many ought
to keep me dodging.

661
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,590
We're taking
every precautión to guard you.

662
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,673
Where are they mostly?

663
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:34,274
Ohio has one 100.000 armed men
ready to rise up and depose you.

664
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,551
lllionois, 135.000.

665
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:41,475
lllinois,
my old stamping ground...

666
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:48,554
That makes me feel badly.
You mustn't tell Mary.

667
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,871
But Mr. President,
we are worried about you.

668
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:57,232
Don't mind me, Hay.
Go on to bed, you're tired.

669
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,955
Lincoln, come on to bed.

670
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,679
I'm worried, Mary.

671
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:35,633
You can't win this war worrying and
walking around in your stocking feet.

672
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,799
I can't sleep.

673
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:43,953
Neither can I. At least we could sleep
in Springfield, couldn't we?

674
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,831
Did we ever sleep?

675
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,556
Now, stand still.

676
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,478
I've got it, Mary.

677
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,118
I've found the man to win this war

678
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:30,995
and his name is Grant.

679
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:45,554
I'm sorry, Mr. President, but smoking
is one of my most persistent habits.

680
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:49,149
And winning victories is another.

681
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,908
Thank you.

682
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,311
Then you do believe in me, Sir?

683
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,833
I sent for you.

684
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:07,758
General, the North is desperate.

685
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,432
We need you.

686
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:22,229
And, should I assume command,
there will be no interference?

687
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,874
None. I promise you that.

688
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,228
Grant,...

689
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,919
Lieutenant-General is
the highest army command

690
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,872
the President can bestow.

691
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,198
We haven't had one
since General Washington.

692
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,719
He was a fair sort of a soldier too.

693
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,398
Lieutenant-General Grant,...

694
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,075
my orders are: Win the War.

695
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:55,113
I'll give my best, Mr. President.

696
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,512
I know you will.

697
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,116
Unfortunately many of us
have failed to recognize

698
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,714
a great Confederate Soldier.

699
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:08,919
Lee.

700
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,074
On the other hand, we have thus far

701
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:17,791
failed to take advantage
of a great Northern Soldier.

702
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,878
I hope I am not too late
in correcting the error.

703
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:27,389
Mr. President,
I think it only fair to warn you

704
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,635
that many people, don't approve of me.

705
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,273
Nor of me.

706
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:38,550
But rest assured
there will be no interference,

707
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,512
no intrusión.

708
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:47,432
Well, of all things!
Who locked this door?

709
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:49,794
My wife!

710
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,479
All right, Mary.

711
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,632
Land sakes!
Where did all the smoke come from?

712
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:05,839
Mary, meet General Grant. Mrs. Lincoln.

713
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:10,638
- It's a pleasure to meet the first lady.
- Thank you.

714
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,157
- I want to talk to you. Mr. Lincoln.
- But Mary, we...

715
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,551
I want to talk to you about discharging
some of the servants in this house.

716
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:20,790
I don't see how anybody
could talk in here with all this smoke.

717
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,112
Why don't you open the window?

718
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,749
I can't stand it!

719
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:28,799
Pardon me, General.

720
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,318
I'll have to talk to you later.

721
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:37,671
- I'm very sorry if...
- There no apoligies, General.

722
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,718
You've given me an idea.

723
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,396
I may take up smoking myself.

724
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,558
But to resume, General.

725
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:54,270
We will give you
all the help you need.

726
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,510
Every man capable
of bearing arms shall go.

727
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,315
We've got to win this war.

728
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:07,635
It is a duty we owe
the South as well as the North.

729
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:13,598
It's a big job, Mr. President...
a big job.

730
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,555
but thy will be done.

731
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:23,793
Thy will be done.

732
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,958
We're in a tight place now.

733
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,431
Yes, we generally are, Stanton.

734
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,240
Everything depends upon Sheridan.

735
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,198
He's a fighting Irishman.

736
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:41,078
Then why doesn't he fight?

737
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,390
- One división Sheridan's -
- army routed. -

738
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:55,669
Now trying to hold left flank. -

739
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:02,479
Oh, the blood it takes
to hold this Unión together.

740
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:08,716
It will undo everything
Grant has done. It's hopeless.

741
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,633
I don't think so...

742
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:16,072
Before each victory I've had
a visión of a ship with white sails.

743
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,556
That visión has just conic to me.

744
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:25,674
With all respect,
I'd rather trade your ship

745
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,236
for good news from Sheridan.

746
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,476
Is that General Sheridan in there?

747
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,998
Sure 'tis General Sheridan.

748
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,512
Doesn't that sound like cannon fire?

749
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,397
I don't hear anything, sir.

750
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,033
Hey, come here.

751
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,045
Have you good ears?

752
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,718
Pretty good when they're washed.

753
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,034
Then try them.

754
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,752
Do you hear anything like cannon fire?

755
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,877
It's cannon all right,
over by the swamp.

756
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,997
They may have caught
General Wright by surprise!

757
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,069
Mount those shorses!

758
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:02,194
- Sheridan's entire army-
- has met an overwhelming defeat. -

759
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:10,594
Incredible.
And no word from Sheridan.

760
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,912
I'm afraid he was away.

761
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,992
It means the defeat of all our plans.

762
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:24,553
Yes, for we'll have
to withdraw Grant from Richmond

763
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,117
to protect Washington.

764
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,199
Come on, boys! Come on!

765
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,310
General,
the right wing is in full retreat.

766
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:17,874
Impossible to hold our positión, sir.

767
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:21,789
Tell Colonel Tolliver
to reform and hold at all costs.

768
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,114
We're going back!

769
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,399
Officers, reform your men!

770
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:31,954
We're going back!

771
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:51,559
- Come on boys, let's go!
- Let's go, boys!

772
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:55,230
Forward!
Forward to victory!

773
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:17,116
- Down with, the traitor,-
- up with the star!-

774
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,231
- While we rally-
- 'round the flag boys,-

775
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:21,118
- We'll rally-
- once again,-

776
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,478
shouting the battle cry of freedom!-

777
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,918
Yes, we'll rally 'round the flag, boys-

778
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,832
We'll rally once again,-

779
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:32,710
Shouting the battle cry of freedom,-

780
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,795
- We will rally from the hillside,-
- We'll gather from the plain. -

781
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,829
Shouting the battle cry of freedom,-

782
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:45,359
- The Unión forever,-
- hurrah, boys, hurrah!-

783
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:48,996
- Sown with the traitor,-
- up with the star. -

784
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,315
While we rally round the flag boys,-

785
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,391
We'll rally once again,-

786
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:57,116
Shouting the battle cry of freedom,-

787
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:13,828
Arrived in time to reform forces. -

788
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:15,918
Have struck the enemy-

789
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:20,150
- and have won an
overwhelming victory. Sheridan. -

790
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,748
I knew it.

791
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,148
I knew it...

792
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:36,670
Better and better. Look! Here.
Tremendous number of prisoners.

793
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:39,879
Prisoners?

794
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:45,878
I hope there's nothing
but prisoners from now on.

795
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:53,956
The ship, Stanton!

796
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,952
Yes, Mr. President,

797
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,279
and Sheridan!

798
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,313
Surrender...

799
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:10,711
my poor army!

800
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:15,311
I'd rather die a thousand deaths
than do that to them.

801
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:19,309
There, General,
you must lie down and rest.

802
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,194
Rest...

803
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,117
that's a beautiful word...

804
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:12,639
They've caught a spy and they want
the order for his executión approved.

805
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,469
Colonel Marshall...

806
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,114
who was that?

807
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,959
- Only a courier, sir.
- What did he want?

808
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:42,152
They've caught a spy.
I approved the executión order, sir.

809
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:43,874
Colonel,...

810
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:49,795
the only reason for shooting a spy
is the protectión of an army, isn't it?

811
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,428
Yes, sir.

812
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:53,919
Well,...

813
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:58,516
you and I know
that this army can't exist much longer.

814
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:01,954
Isn't that right?

815
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,714
Yes, sir.

816
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:09,114
That is why I am unwilling
that there shall be a single life lost

817
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,193
unnecessarily.

818
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:16,908
Colonel...

819
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:21,239
I wonder if you'd mind
countermanding that order.

820
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,554
I will.
Yes, sir.

821
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:07,359
Tired, Grant?

822
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,479
Not much.

823
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,357
Mr. President, we have them.

824
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:36,033
It can only last a few days more.

825
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:40,551
General Sherman and I are glad
of this chance to talk with you.

826
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:45,673
The Unión...
we've saved it at last.

827
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:47,912
They must surrender soon.

828
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:50,308
The Unión...

829
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,397
We'll have 'em all back...

830
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:58,115
United, free...
one Country.

831
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,558
And meanwhile, Mr. President?

832
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:05,838
I've heard the country
wishes all rebel property confiscated

833
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:11,755
and the rebel generals,
such as Lee, shot for treason.

834
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,070
He's put up a grand battle.

835
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:20,397
And they've robbed
the cradle and the grave, sir.

836
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,477
Lee is fighting with his last breath.

837
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,392
Shoot Robert E. Lee?

838
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,398
Someone will have to shoot
Abraham Lincoln first.

839
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:36,555
They're rebels, not traitors.

840
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:40,428
And their horses and baggage, sir?

841
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:44,195
They'll need them
for the spring plowing.

842
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,112
Let 'em keep 'em and get to work.

843
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,759
Very good, sir.

844
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:53,194
Just one thing more, Mr. President...

845
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:57,794
the head of the rebel government
Jefferson Davis?

846
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:01,954
Jefferson Davis...

847
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,232
Do you wish his capture?

848
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,555
That reminds me of a story.

849
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:12,557
We had a terrible drunkard once

850
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:15,954
in Springfield.

851
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,590
Finally he signed the pledge.

852
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,238
Next day he got thirsty

853
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,709
and went to a bar
and ordered a lemonade.

854
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:29,276
While the bartender was fixing it,
the old drunk got sadder and sadder.

855
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,955
Finally he leaned over
and said to the bartender,

856
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:37,791
"Mike, while you're fixin' that,

857
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,071
couldn't you put
a nice little shot of whiskey in,

858
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:41,958
unbeknownst to meself?"

859
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:43,919
Well, sir?

860
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,309
Couldn't you sort
of lot Jeff Davis escape,

861
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,472
unbeknownst to yourselves?

862
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:54,513
We'll do our part, sir.

863
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:02,468
We're going to take them back
as though they'd never been away.

864
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,353
Lincoln...

865
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,392
He freed the negroes.

866
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:24,392
He's supressed
the right of a trail by jury.

867
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,353
He muzzled the press!

868
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,949
Now, wiht the oid of this "butternuts",

869
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,995
his army and his negroes,
he make himself

870
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,559
King of the América.

871
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,194
Lincoln!

872
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:51,879
I drink to him...

873
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,879
and his domatión!

874
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:04,753
Right,...

875
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,439
you're right.

876
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,798
On my part...

877
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:17,197
Go on,
you're among friends...

878
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:24,272
The man who kills Abraham Lincoln

879
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:27,311
will be inmortal.

880
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,473
Now, listen...

881
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,113
I have a plan...

882
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:41,954
and I'm going in.

883
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,314
Do you mind my smoking, Mrs. Lincoln?

884
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,756
No, not much.

885
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:05,396
You don't know how glad we all are
that you were reelected, Mr. President.

886
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,399
I'm sure this lady will be glad

887
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:09,153
to spend four more years
in the White House.

888
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,669
Glad? I've just hired two new maids.

889
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:17,550
Lincoln, will you ever learn
to keep your feet in shoes?

890
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:23,196
Mrs. Lincoln,
have you met General Grant?

891
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,716
I met him. It took us a week
to get the smoke out of the curtains.

892
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:33,349
Yes, Oglesby, he's one
human being who has faults.

893
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,960
A party of prohibitionists,
called on me the other day

894
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:38,958
and complained about Grant's drinking.

895
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,639
I told 'em if I knew what brand he uses,

896
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:45,115
I'd send barrels of it
to my other generals.

897
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,031
Two new maids...

898
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,994
If we're going to be
here four more years...

899
01:21:55,120 --> 01:22:00,319
Four years...
four more years...

900
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:03,797
Mr. Lincoln, don't you go thinking
about of those dreams again.

901
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:08,433
You'll live two hundred and after
we'll celebrate it right over here,

902
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:13,193
we'll travel around the worid
and have a nice long rest.

903
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:17,989
Oh, Daddy!,
Would that be fun?

904
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:21,875
- You're not going without me...?
- Why, of course not, Tad.

905
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:30,077
You can depend on Mother Surratt,
and everything is straight with me.

906
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,719
I said I'd go through with it,
and I will.

907
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:38,115
Tonight will be remembered
throughout the ages.

908
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:43,432
I play my best part.

909
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:52,795
How much better a dagger would look,

910
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,556
Cassius used a dagger,

911
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:04,358
but this is safer.

912
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:34,318
- Speech!
- Speech!

913
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:45,955
- Speech!
- Speech!

914
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:58,870
Again I say,

915
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:03,035
with malice toward none,

916
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:06,715
with charity for all,

917
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:10,877
with firmness in the right

918
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,594
as God gives us to see the right,

919
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:19,151
we shall bind up
the natión's wounds and cherish peace.

920
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:31,274
That government of the people,
by the people, for the people

921
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:35,397
shall not perish from the earth.

922
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,069
Thank you.

923
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,639
God bless you all.

924
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:05,477
Mr. Lincoln, I'm just proud of you!

925
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:12,118
- Peanuts, hold the horse for me?
- Yes.

926
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:18,713
Will you be long, sir?

927
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:22,952
No, not very long.

928
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:31,032
Dundreary,
would you mind bringing me a wrap?

929
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:32,919
I feel a draught.

930
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,999
I'm afraid you must be mistaken.

931
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:38,159
Mr. Lincoln...

932
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:40,796
has just stopped the draft.

933
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:08,958
I reckon I'm going
to feel right to home here, b'gosh!

934
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:13,078
I would be too if it wasn't for
that 'ternal servant-critter

935
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:15,675
with brass buttons on his coat.

936
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:24,431
He just swells out his big bosom
like a turkey cock in layin' time,

937
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,754
looks at me as if I meant
to esquatulate with the spoons.

938
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:36,758
I reckon they don't know who they're
dealin' with, but I'll show 'em.

939
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:40,637
I'm as obstinate
as Deacon Stumpp's forelock.

940
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,035
"It wouldn't lie down; it couldn't stand up,"

941
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:47,557
wouldn't point forward and couldn't go backward.

942
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,478
I don't know what
they're going to do with me,

943
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:56,715
but whatever they do do
and wherever they put me,

944
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,275
I hope it's outa
the reach of that jackass.

945
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:03,512
I'm a real hoss, I am,

946
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,194
and I get kinda riley with them critters.

947
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:11,872
They say I don't know
the manners of good society too,

948
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:17,029
but I guess I know enough
to turn that old gal inside out,

949
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:20,470
the sock-dollaging old mantrap.

950
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:23,958
But I dare no more kill her

951
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:26,117
than I dare ask Queen Victoria

952
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,914
to dance a Cape Cod reel.

953
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:42,596
Sic semper tyrannis!

954
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:48,398
Mr. Lincoln,
Mr. Lincoln has been shot!

955
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:05,278
Get a doctor!
Somebody get a doctor!

956
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:24,839
Glory, glory Hallelujah!-

957
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:34,196
Glory, glory Hallelujah!-

958
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:43,112
Glory, glory Hallelujah!-

959
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:53,759
His soul is marching on!-
