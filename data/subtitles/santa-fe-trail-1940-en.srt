Well, at least, we know
how to harness them.

You know how to harness Negroes

with you is a lying renegade.

responsible for it

have not been fully known to us
until this moment.

of the academy

you should be discharged
from the service.

And your associates are
no less guilty for their part

00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,681
in this outrageous affair.

115
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,475
Colonel Lee, any blame in this
matter is entirely upon me.

It's my sole responsibility,
sir.

117
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,646
That's not quite true, sir.
It was my fault.

We are all equally
responsible, sir.

Man 5: That's right, sir.

If I believe that
you were guilty alone, Stuart

00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,820
I should have
sent for you alone.

As for you, Custer,
and the rest of you

00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,159
you must be taught
that lying to protect a friend

124
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:33,454
is sometimes an extremely
dangerous practice.

I'm not so greatly concerned
about the fight itself

126

as I am about its cause.

of political ideas.

of an American solider.

sympathetic to their cause.

159
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,855
How long has this undercover
activity of yours been going on?

160
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,214
Long enough.

161
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,007
Very clear idea
of your fellow conspirators

162
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,134
to plant an agent in our midst.

163
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:14,137
Your dishonorable discharge
will be drawn up at once.

164
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,557
And you will be given until
sundown to remove yourself

165
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,935
and your personal belongings
from the limits of Westpoint.

166
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,228
Good.

167
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,278
And you can tell
Mr. Stuart for me

168
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,822
that he'd be smart
to stay in the army.

169
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,449
Right in the middle
of it from now on.

That's my sister Kit.

00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,847
Thought two years in Boston
would make a lady out of you.

192
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,266
So did I, it just popped out.

It is now my great honor
and privilege to introduce

198
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,076
the secretary of war
of the United States of America.

199
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,286
The Honorable Jefferson Davis.

their welcomed guests
and their very proud families,

203
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,468
I'll not keep you separated
very long

204
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,096
as I myself once
sat in your place

205
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,098
and endure an interminable
address

206
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,517
by a very tiresome general.

207
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,644
[laughing]

208
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,980
But as a secretary of war
of this nation

209
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:31,817
I have a serious obligation
towards each new officer

210
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,196
of the army before he enters
into active service.

211
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,782
And that obligation
is to make clear and definite

212
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,993
his responsibility
to his government.

213
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:45,288
We are a new nation among
the powers of the world.

214
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,790
Just 80 years ago

215
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,626
we were fighting desperately
for our freedom.

216
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,003
And we are still fighting
to keep it.

217
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:56,216
We are not yet a wealthy nation,
except in spirit.

218
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,969
And that unity of spirit
is our greatest strength.

219
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,138
You men now have but one duty.

220
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,266
One alone. America.

221
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,853
With your unswerving loyalty
and the grace of God

222
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:11,148
our nation shall have no fears
for the future.

223
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,234
And your lives will have been
spent in the noblest

224
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:18,280
of all causes, the defense
of the rights of man.

Tickets. Tickets.

233
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,915
Mr. Holliday, we're getting
close to Leavenworth.

234
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,834
Yeah, it's a shame
this tea kettle of yours

235
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,210
doesn't go any further.

236
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,754
What for?
There's nothing to go to.

237
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,673
There's half a nation out there,
cap.

238
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,883
Someday I'll build
a real railroad to open it up.

239
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:03,301
Clear the Santa Fe.

240
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,303
For a man who made
a fortune out of horses

241
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:08,640
you sure got a heap to learn.

242
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,576
Hey, cap, tell the boys to
speed it up, will you?

243
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,995
The last time I had get out and
help chop wood for the engine.

244
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,372
Well, the first time
you rode with me

245
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:15,564
I had to change your diapers.

246
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:18,108
[laughing]

247
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,027
Hey, cap, where am I going?

248
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,946
Looks like you are going
to Hades.

249
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,490
Just wanted to know.

250
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:27,885
Bob's been telling us about
that railroad Santa Fe so long.

251
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,469
Now, Mr. Holiday,
I'm surprised to learn

252
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,579
it hasn't even been built.

253
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,455
Well, let's not all foster it.

254
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,976
You can't build a railroad over
blood-soaked ground like Kansas.

255
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,543
Decent sellers won't use it.

256
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,045
We are losing thousands of
pioneer to Oregon Trail.

257
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,547
They circle right around us.

258
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,841
We heard about the raided
arsenal last week.

259
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,926
What is the true situation
out here, sir?

260
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,054
Well, Kansas is a territory
and not a state.

261
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:50,390
We are ready to join the Union,
but the big question is

262
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,018
whether we'll go in as a
slave state or as a free state.

263
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,353
On one side is most of
Kansas' pro-slavers

264
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:56,813
people who came from south.

265
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,332
On the other side are
the abolitionists

266
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,233
lead by John Brown and the sons.

267
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:02,044
Between those two elements
they've made Kansas

268
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,154
a boiling pot of
rebellion and massacres.

269
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,590
That's why the army sent
you boys out here

270
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:06,990
to Fort Leavenworth.

271
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:10,869
Suicide station,
it's quite an honor.

272
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:14,039
- Excuse me, will you, sir?
- Surely.

273
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,333
You know, the first time
I saw you at the graduation

274
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,793
I thought of what Napoleon said
when he first met Josephine.

275
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,587
What was that?

276
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,964
He said, "I never knew this
savage land they call America

277
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:25,800
could breath such
perfect beauty in mortal form."

278
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:27,844
Oh. Thank you.

279
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,096
- That's a lovely line.
- Yeah, isn't it?

280
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,724
George has been using it
for years, haven't you, George?

281
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:36,061
I... I wish I could think of
nice things like that to say.

282
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,938
You wouldn't like
what I'm thinking now.

283
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,398
You were going to tell me
something more about Kansas.

284
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:43,985
Yes, what do you do on
Saturday nights for fun here?

285
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:47,822
Well, as I remember,
half of Leavenworth takes a bath

286
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,574
another the half gets drunk.

287
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:51,344
And since there are
only two bathtubs in town

288
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,161
they seem a kind of exciting
around midnight.

289
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:56,373
Kit! Kit! Kit.

290
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,709
By the way, how they ever came
to name you Kit Carson Holliday?

291
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:02,253
Well, Mr. Carson and my dad
were very good friends.

292
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:04,097
And they were so sure
I was going to be a boy

293
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,924
they named me before I was born.

294
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:09,719
Oh, I see. Well, I'm certainly
glad they were wrong.

295
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,263
- Me too.
- Me too.

296
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:14,849
Me too!

297
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,476
- Hey, conductor.
- Yeah?

298
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,919
What're you going to do
about that?

299
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:21,648
- About what?
- I'll tend to that.

300
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,483
Hey, I thought I told you

301
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,610
them Negroes had to
ride in the last coach.

302
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,404
Their tickets gives them
the right to ride

303
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,030
wherever they please.

304
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,032
Now, I don't want any trouble
with you, mister.

305
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:32,951
Then you better leave us alone.

306
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:36,371
Well, I don't know what
this country is coming to.

307
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,707
- Tickets!
- Stop shaking, Anna.

308
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,166
There's nothing to worry about.

309
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,669
We're only half an hour
from the border.

310
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,255
If we don't hurry,
they will be across the border.

311
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,881
Alright, go ahead.

312

Where you taking the Negroes?

314
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,313
What business is that of yours?

315
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:05,608
We are asking the questions.
Are they free or bond?

316
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:09,696
Here are the papers.
You can see it for yourself.

317
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:13,324
Yeah, that might mean something
if we didn't know who you are.

318
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,702
Now don't you make a move.

319
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,388
We're taking
you and them off of this train

320
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,205
while they're still in Missouri.

321
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,207
Now, come on, get up all of you.

322
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,710
[instrumental music]

323
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,601
Where're they gonna take us,
Master Brown?

324
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,895
What they gonna do with us?

325
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,397
[gunshot]

326
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:45,607
Stop him.

327
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,076
What do you know about this?

328
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,912
There is the trouble,
Negro slaves.

329
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,498
He was trying to sneak 'em
across the state line.

330
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,249
I'll get that murdering
jayhawker for this

331
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,627
if I'll have to hang for it.

332
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,545
- Who was it?
- Oliver Brown.

333
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,255
One of John Brown's
scurvy litter.

334
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,800
Better than a doornail.
Come on, you'll get by greenhorn

335
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:14,636
give me a hand. There ain't
no use spoiling the carpet.

336
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,054
Come on, get him out of the way.

337
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,806
Now, don't get excited,
everybody.

338
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,933
Sit down, please.

339
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:23,019
This is what they mean
when call it bloody Kansas.

340
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,122
There'll never be any peace
along the Santa Fe Trail

341
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,732
while John Brown or any of his
followers are alive.

342
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,570
[instrumental music]

343
00:18:53,635 --> 00:18:55,261
Cyrus: Now this is
the present terminal.

344
00:18:55,345 --> 00:18:57,555
I proposed to come down here
to Wichita.

345
00:18:57,639 --> 00:18:59,974
And along here across
the Arkansas River

346
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:02,685
along the Cimarron River,
over here to Las Vegas.

347
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:04,354
Here on into Santa Fe.

348
00:19:04,437 --> 00:19:06,040
Now that'll be
our first section of track.

349
00:19:06,064 --> 00:19:08,441
From Leavenworth to Wichita.
Right over the trail.

350
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:10,068
How soon do you figure to start?

351
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:11,545
Well, the men back east say
they are ready

352
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:13,172
to put up the money as soon
as we can prove

353
00:19:13,196 --> 00:19:15,531
that a rail route through Kansas
are safe and will pay.

354
00:19:15,615 --> 00:19:17,742
- Dad!
- Yes, Kit.

355
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:19,185
Where did you put
the loading list?

356
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:22,121
List? Gosh, I clearly forgot
to make one out.

357
00:19:22,205 --> 00:19:23,498
That's great!

358
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:24,892
Ninety eight tons
of freight ready to roll

359
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,417
and no orders for loading,

360
00:19:26,501 --> 00:19:28,294
how'd you run this business
while I was away?

361
00:19:28,378 --> 00:19:30,880
That's why I sent you away to
show you what a skirt was.

362
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:33,383
Look at your clothes,
look at the grease your nose.

363
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:35,635
What would your friends
in Boston think of you now?

364
00:19:35,718 --> 00:19:37,387
Frankly, dad, I don't much care.

365
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,239
If you are going to keep your
nose in the paper railway

366
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:41,391
I better keep mine
in the family affairs.

367
00:19:41,474 --> 00:19:43,518
Tex!

368
00:19:43,601 --> 00:19:45,478
Windy!

369
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:47,271
Tex!

370
00:19:47,355 --> 00:19:48,773
Where are those ornery cousins?

371
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:50,983
What do they think they're
getting paid for?

372
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:52,276
Tex!

373
00:19:54,404 --> 00:19:56,531
Why didn't you tell me?

374
00:19:56,614 --> 00:19:58,241
Getting jealous, huh?

375
00:19:58,324 --> 00:20:00,827
I didn't even see Lilly
when I said goodbye to her.

376
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,830
Oh, now don't start lying to me,
you double crossing buzzard.

377
00:20:03,913 --> 00:20:05,516
I know that you didn't buy
that there looking glass to see

378
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,791
your own ugly mug.

379
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:08,185
I suppose
you're figuring on wearing

380
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:09,836
that female cinching belt.

381
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,796
Wait till Lilly sees
what you brung her.

382
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,131
She'll brain you.

383
00:20:13,214 --> 00:20:15,299
If it ain't physically
impossible.

384
00:20:15,383 --> 00:20:17,635
- Why you ignorant...
- Kit: Tex.

385
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:19,637
Hey, you two.
Where in the name...

386
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:21,097
Will you come here?

387
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:25,143
- Hello, Ms. Kit.
- Hello nothing.

388
00:20:25,226 --> 00:20:26,866
Are you gentlemen of leisure
by any chance

389
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:28,604
interested in employment?

390
00:20:28,688 --> 00:20:30,565
Oh, we lost our watch.

391
00:20:30,648 --> 00:20:32,483
Yeah, we didn't have
no idea of time.

392
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,336
I ought to give you both your
time and throw you out.

393
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,820
Where in thunder have you been?

394
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:39,031
Well, you see,
we had to buy these nick-nacks.

395
00:20:39,115 --> 00:20:42,368
Well, we sort of got a gal
in Santa Fe, Lilly, uh...

396
00:20:42,452 --> 00:20:44,370
Hofstadter.
And what do you mean we?

397
00:20:44,454 --> 00:20:46,539
- I'm engaged to her.
- Well, who ain't?

398
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,001
You set up housekeeping
at Santa Fe

399
00:20:50,084 --> 00:20:52,086
or is this just
gilding the lily?

400
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,756
Oh, she want us to fetch her
one of them

401
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:57,049
fancy French looking glasses.

402
00:20:57,133 --> 00:20:58,551
Ain't it pretty?

403
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:00,511
What's your answer to that, Tex?

404
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:05,391
[laughing]

405
00:21:05,475 --> 00:21:08,144
What are you all laughing at,
you long eared jackasses?

406
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,190
Go on, get to work, both of you.

407
00:21:12,273 --> 00:21:14,484
Go on, jump to it.

408
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:17,695
You better hide that thing
or start wearing it.

409
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:20,198
[instrumental music]

410
00:21:36,005 --> 00:21:37,298
I'm going to put you
new officers

411
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:38,674
straight from the start.

412
00:21:38,758 --> 00:21:41,469
This is Fort Leavenworth
and not Westpoint.

413
00:21:41,552 --> 00:21:44,430
You were sent here
to man the frontier garrison.

414
00:21:44,514 --> 00:21:47,391
Three of the officers
you're supposed to be replacing

415
00:21:47,475 --> 00:21:50,895
are buried back of the hill
in the little military cemetery.

416
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:53,231
The other four
haven't been found yet.

417
00:21:53,314 --> 00:21:56,150
The regiment of mounted rifles
has only one job

418
00:21:56,234 --> 00:21:58,194
to keep the peace in Kansas.

419
00:21:58,277 --> 00:21:59,695
And we're here alone.

420
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:02,406
There's no other fort
between us and Santa Fe.

421
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,659
And we're proud
of that responsibility.

422
00:22:04,742 --> 00:22:06,828
We've got a tough reputation
in the army

423
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:08,746
but they respect us in the west.

424
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,457
See that it stays that way.

425
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:15,044
Order of the day, Lieutenants
Longstreet and Holliday

426
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:17,296
take B troop and put
them through close order drill.

427
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,757
Lieutenants Stuart and Custer
will take eight men

428
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:21,509
as an escort
for the freight caravan

429
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:23,553
leaving at noon for New Mexico.

430
00:22:23,636 --> 00:22:26,597
Draw the usual supplies and
report to me for final orders.

431
00:22:31,686 --> 00:22:33,104
Say, will you keep all those

432
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:34,814
cases of Bibles
near the tail board.

433
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:36,190
They're only going a short haul.

434
00:22:36,274 --> 00:22:38,818
We sure will.

435
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:40,194
Let's go.

436
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,739
[instrumental music]

437
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:48,494
Convoy ready, sir,
we're ready if you are.

438
00:22:48,578 --> 00:22:50,288
Good, I hope you have
a nice, quiet trip.

439
00:22:50,371 --> 00:22:52,081
On any other kind, I lose money.

440
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:53,875
Oh, we will try
and save you that.

441
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:56,127
We'll see you in six weeks, sir,
with luck.

442
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,504
Just keep your eyes open, boys,
and move fast.

443
00:22:58,588 --> 00:23:00,923
You'll like the scenery
but don't trust it.

444
00:23:01,007 --> 00:23:02,174
Alright. Goodbye, sir.

445
00:23:02,258 --> 00:23:03,801
Goodbye, Stuart.
Goodbye, Custer.

446
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:06,304
[instrumental music]

447
00:23:06,387 --> 00:23:08,806
[indistinct chatter]

448
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,311
Corporal, detail two men
to cover each wagon.

449
00:23:13,394 --> 00:23:15,313
Yes, sir.

450
00:23:15,396 --> 00:23:17,982
Phil, move all these barrels
over there for the next ride.

451
00:23:27,825 --> 00:23:30,536
- Well.
- Hey.

452
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,055
Looks like we both
got the same idea.

453
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,165
Looks that way.
How're we gonna work it?

454
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,376
Here.

455
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,753
I've got an idea.

456
00:23:38,836 --> 00:23:41,589
- Let's draw for it.
- Fair enough.

457
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:42,965
Right.

458
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:49,263
- I got the long one.
- Hey, wait a minute.

459
00:23:49,347 --> 00:23:51,140
Where I come from
long man loses.

460
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:54,393
Tough luck, old man.
Here, hold my horse.

461
00:23:54,477 --> 00:23:58,564
One hand plow, one seater,
seven eggs, 15, 12 and 14 and...

462
00:23:58,648 --> 00:24:00,691
Why, Joe,
there is something missing.

463
00:24:00,775 --> 00:24:02,068
Must be me. Hello.

464
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:03,694
Hello. What are you doing here?

465
00:24:03,778 --> 00:24:05,297
Oh, playing nursemaid
for those wagons.

466
00:24:05,321 --> 00:24:06,548
Should be the other way around.

467
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:08,532
Oh, the convoy.
That's a silly idea.

468
00:24:08,616 --> 00:24:11,202
Dad, he thinks that man
John Brown is behind every bush.

469
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:12,620
Well, it's not that
I mind so much

470
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:14,014
it's being away from
you for six weeks

471
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:15,706
just when we're getting started.

472
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,416
Started? When?

473
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,518
Now, look, I've only got
a few minutes left.

474
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,127
So I've got to be fast.

475
00:24:20,211 --> 00:24:21,897
You haven't been exactly slow
for a couple of days.

476
00:24:21,921 --> 00:24:23,231
I've never seen
such a pair of whirlwinds

477
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:24,840
as you and George Custer.

478
00:24:24,924 --> 00:24:26,968
George, poor old George.
Well, never mind about him.

479
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:29,929
Look, Kit, I might as well
tell you before I go.

480
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:31,847
I'm completely crazy about you.

481
00:24:31,931 --> 00:24:32,950
- What?
- No, wait a minute.

482
00:24:32,974 --> 00:24:34,183
Let me finish.

483
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:35,535
I needn't warn you
about army life.

484
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,103
The pay is bad,
I'd never be home.

485
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:39,105
You'd probably be a widow
in two weeks.

486
00:24:39,188 --> 00:24:41,440
I see, have you thought
of any particular names

487
00:24:41,524 --> 00:24:42,525
for the children?

488
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:44,193
No, be serious, will you?

489
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:46,213
This might be the most
precious moment in our lives.

490
00:24:46,237 --> 00:24:47,905
I hope not,
not in these clothes.

491
00:24:47,989 --> 00:24:50,408
Haven't you got
any heart at all?

492
00:24:50,491 --> 00:24:54,078
Yes, I have, and it's going to
stay right where it is.

493
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:55,871
I don't know
a thing about you, Jeb Stuart.

494
00:24:55,955 --> 00:24:58,124
My brother thinks
you're wonderful.

495
00:24:58,207 --> 00:25:00,367
But then he was dropped
on his head when he was a baby.

496
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:05,006
Well, at least you'll let me
kiss you goodbye, won't you?

497
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:09,051
Oh, well, it's quite an honor,
but no, thanks.

498
00:25:09,135 --> 00:25:11,053
I... I don't really deserve it.

499
00:25:11,137 --> 00:25:14,098
Well, hello.
Say, this is quite a surprise.

500
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:15,951
The corporal's looking for you,
says it's very urgent.

501
00:25:15,975 --> 00:25:17,476
Mm-hmm, I'll bet.

502
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,621
Kit, we will take this up later
right where we left off.

503
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:21,355
Now, George,
don't be long winded.

504
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:23,291
Listen, Kit, we're due to
leave in a minute now.

505
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:25,109
There's something
I've got to tell you.

506
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:26,944
I'm head over heels in love
with you.

507
00:25:27,028 --> 00:25:29,488
George, you sound just
like an echo.

508
00:25:29,572 --> 00:25:31,699
Oh, Kit. Ah, pardon the
interruption, George old man.

509
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:33,093
Kit, there is something
I forgot to ask you.

510
00:25:33,117 --> 00:25:34,827
Have I got any real competition?

511
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,722
How do you think any girl would
answer a question like this?

512
00:25:36,746 --> 00:25:39,081
- Well, just tell me the truth.
- Then you'd both be crazy.

513
00:25:39,165 --> 00:25:41,167
Get going, you bull whackers!

514
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,085
Through desert heat and dust

515
00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:45,212
your throats will soon
be choking.

516
00:25:45,296 --> 00:25:47,214
S Your head's about to bust.

517
00:25:47,298 --> 00:25:49,175
No water when you're thirsty.

518
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:51,135
And all you get to eat.

519
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:54,680
Is aromatic antelope
and some big buffalo meat

520
00:25:54,764 --> 00:25:57,475
Yippy-aye.

521
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:59,185
Good luck, boys.

522
00:25:59,268 --> 00:26:02,271
We may not even
live to get our pay.

523
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:04,815
But even if we don't get paid.

524
00:26:04,899 --> 00:26:06,817
There ain't no job we trade.

525
00:26:06,901 --> 00:26:08,819
For hauling freight
from state to state.

526
00:26:08,903 --> 00:26:10,780
Along the Santa Fe.

527
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:12,215
For hauling freight
from state to state.

528
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:14,241
Along the Santa Fe

529
00:26:14,325 --> 00:26:16,243
Yippy-aye.

530
00:26:16,327 --> 00:26:18,370
Aye-yay.

531
00:26:18,454 --> 00:26:21,957
There's trouble riding with us
all the way.

532
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:23,793
You'll think over
what I said, Kit?

533
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:26,712
Every word.
Take care of yourself, George.

534
00:26:26,796 --> 00:26:28,798
Don't worry about that.
Goodbye, darling.

535
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:30,299
Along the Santa Fe

536
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:32,009
Yippy-aye.

537
00:26:32,093 --> 00:26:34,053
Aye-yay.

538
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:37,556
There's trouble riding with us
all the way.

539
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,059
Although we sweat and whine
and cuss.

540
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:41,811
The only job for us.

541
00:26:41,894 --> 00:26:44,230
Is hauling freight
from state to state...

542
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:47,191
- Wanna make a little bet, Kit?
- Sure, on what?

543
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:48,859
Those two boys.

544
00:26:48,943 --> 00:26:51,612
I'll give you a three to one
I can name the winner.

545
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:53,155
That's ridiculous.

546
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:55,783
[laughing]

547
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:57,368
Which one do you want?

548
00:26:58,953 --> 00:27:00,538
[indistinct]

549
00:27:02,123 --> 00:27:05,501
- I'll take that bet.
- Good!

550
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:07,586
Is hauling freight
from state to state.

551
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:10,089
Along the Santa Fe

552
00:27:11,507 --> 00:27:13,926
[instrumental music]

553
00:27:18,681 --> 00:27:20,057
And to instruct
to all volunteers

554
00:27:20,141 --> 00:27:21,809
not to enter Kansas unequipped.

555
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:24,812
Nor to display their weapons
to public view.

556
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:27,314
Let that be understood
beforehand.

557
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:29,150
- Warn them also...
- Not so fast, father.

558
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:31,068
Warn them also
that our plans must be known

559
00:27:31,152 --> 00:27:33,237
to ourselves alone.

560
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,948
That they join me in the clear
knowledge that all traitors

561
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:38,159
of the cause must die

562
00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:41,662
wherever caught
and proven to be guilty.

563
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:43,181
Tell them that we stand by
one another

564
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:44,707
while a drop of blood remains.

565
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,793
That under no threats or
pressure do we make confessions.

566
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:56,051
Alright, that's our camp.

567
00:27:56,135 --> 00:27:57,863
I might as well tell you
when you get this far

568
00:27:57,887 --> 00:27:59,221
you don't turn back.

569
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:00,806
You don't have to
worry about us.

570
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,641
We ain't the kind that quit.

571
00:28:02,725 --> 00:28:04,810
That's fine.
Just see you keep it that way.

572
00:28:04,894 --> 00:28:07,396
Save all of us
a lot of unpleasantness.

573
00:28:15,863 --> 00:28:17,698
You've been delayed.
Was there trouble, Rader?

574
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:20,034
No, sir, we had to detour
when we got to the border.

575
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:22,244
I picked these new men
up in Palmyra.

576
00:28:22,328 --> 00:28:25,164
Volunteers, sir.
Here are their credentials.

577
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:27,666
From Illinois.
You've come a long way.

578
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,711
And we'll go the rest of it.
We came here to fight slavers.

579
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:33,422
- The sooner the better.
- That's good.

580
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:35,674
We'll put you to work at once.

581
00:28:35,758 --> 00:28:37,593
Kitzmiller,
look after these gentlemen.

582
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:39,261
Kitzmiller: Fine.
This way, boys.

583
00:28:39,345 --> 00:28:42,139
[indistinct chatter]

584
00:28:42,223 --> 00:28:44,266
We've received the news
we've been waiting for.

585
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,894
- We break camp, Rader.
- Yes, sir!

586
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:48,646
Let's start tearing down
these tents now.

587
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:51,148
[instrumental music]

588
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:57,488
Oliver! He's hurt.

589
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:59,865
- I'm alright. Where's father?
- Father!

590
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,787
What has happened to you?

591
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,473
Where are the Negroes
you were told to bring?

592
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:08,791
A couple of pro-slavers tried
to grab us on the train.

593
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:10,501
I shot one of 'em
and jumped off.

594
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:13,170
You left four helpless people
alone to save yourself?

595
00:29:13,254 --> 00:29:15,214
I had to do it, father.
It was me or them.

596
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:16,882
You cowardly fool!

597
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:22,221
In future obey my instructions.

598
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,806
We leave at once.

599
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:26,308
[instrumental music]

600
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:33,148
All of you,
down upon your knees.

601
00:29:35,985 --> 00:29:38,570
As once you sent the ravens
to save Elijah

602
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:40,864
so how you have delivered
into my hands

603
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:44,618
the precious means
of continuing Thy holy work.

604
00:29:44,702 --> 00:29:47,413
The Lord our God is a great God

605
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:49,957
a mighty and a terrible
who regardth not persons

606
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,501
nor taketh reward.

607
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:54,795
The Lord is a man of war.

608
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:58,632
Thy right hand shall become
glorious through power.

609
00:29:58,716 --> 00:30:02,219
Thy right hand, oh, God shall
dash in pieces the enemy.

610
00:30:04,138 --> 00:30:06,557
[instrumental music]

611
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:12,146
Hey, Oscar.

612
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:14,207
When we cross the river
you watch out for that wagon.

613
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:16,025
It's got my looking glass.

614
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:17,585
Hey, Tex.
These horses are pretty tired.

615
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:18,849
When are we going to make camp?

616
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:20,404
Oh, as soon as
we cross the river

617
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,299
and then we'll be out of danger
from both sides.

618
00:30:22,323 --> 00:30:23,550
You know, lieutenant,
I'm sure glad

619
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:25,159
we're leaving civilization.

620
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:27,786
It's getting too dangerous
for a peace-loving man.

621
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,997
I run into some of
them abolitionists this once.

622
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,791
But who's this fella John Brown
they talk so much about?

623
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:35,169
Oh, as far as I know
he's just a dirty old windbag.

624
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:39,006
- In fact, he's just your type.
- Either of you ever meet him?

625
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:41,192
Tex: No, but two of them fellas
he killed at Osawatomie

626
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:42,509
were friends of mine.

627
00:30:42,593 --> 00:30:44,219
You mean Jim Doyle
and Allan Wilkerson?

628
00:30:44,303 --> 00:30:45,947
Yeah, and that's the reason
I'd sure like to meet up

629
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:47,723
with this here Mr. John Brown.

630
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:50,059
He's got no quarrel
with people like you, Tex.

631
00:30:50,142 --> 00:30:52,311
You would do much better
to leave him alone.

632
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:54,271
Well, you can
count me in anyhow.

633
00:30:54,355 --> 00:30:56,398
Even if he ain't harm
no friends of mine

634
00:30:56,482 --> 00:30:58,609
I sure would hate to miss
a good fight.

635

[instrumental music]

636
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:14,541
This is wrong, father.

637
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:16,877
We've never attacked
a wagon train before.

638
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,879
We aren't common highwaymen.

639
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,547
You say we have
a righteous cause

640
00:31:20,631 --> 00:31:22,841
but this will bring the law
down on us like a storm.

641
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:25,761
We recognize no law
but the law of God.

642
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:27,429
You will do as I command.

643
00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:39,483
Take your men back, Rader.
Wait for my signal.

644

[instrumental music]

646
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:09,430
Howdy, strangers.

647
00:32:09,513 --> 00:32:11,265
Good morning.
Are these Holliday's wagons?

648
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:13,267
- That's right, sir.
- My name is Smith.

649
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,977
Jonathan Smith of Newton.

650
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,979
Ah, well,
what can we do for you?

651
00:32:17,062 --> 00:32:19,648
I believe you're carrying
some freight consigned to me.

652
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:21,751
Oh, we might be, if you got
something to show for it.

653
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:24,820
I have this receipt
from the shipper.

654
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:27,132
Come a long way with an empty
wagon, haven't you, Mr. Smith?

655
00:32:27,156 --> 00:32:28,991
Newton's about
a 100 miles from here.

656
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:31,326
My home is in Newton, sir,
but my place of business

657
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,245
is much closer to the trail.

658
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:34,830
Oh, I see.

659
00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:36,665
I thought your horses
look pretty fresh.

660
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:39,084
Eight cases of Bibles.
That's right.

661
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,837
Come on, Windy, we will unpack
these Bibles for the parson.

662
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,047
Jason, bring up your wagon.

663
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:50,846
Get that cart down.

664
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:52,031
I got to get them Bibles
unpacked

665
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:55,017
for the parson.

666
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,853
That's a funny thing.
I've seen that fella somewhere.

667
00:32:57,936 --> 00:32:59,980
It's the way it seems to me.

668
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:01,666
It isn't the kind of a face
you'd forget in a hurry.

669
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,109
Yeah. Wait a minute.

670
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:06,820
I know. In some magazine,
"The Atlantic" I think.

671
00:33:06,904 --> 00:33:09,364
Well, and he's either from
Boston or he's a missionary.

672
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:12,868
No, it was something else.

673
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:19,708
Been a lot of bad trouble

674
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:22,252
over across the river lately,
Mr. Smith.

675
00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:24,755
That murdering skunk John Brown
is on the loose again.

676
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:26,298
Better keep your eye
peeled for him.

677
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:28,008
Thank you. We shall.

678
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:32,721
This stuff sure is heavy
for Bibles.

679
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:35,349
How would you know?
You ain't never even saw one.

680
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:36,683
Ah..

681

[instrumental music]

682
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:55,244
Just a minute.

683
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,415
I'd like to see those Bibles.

684
00:34:00,499 --> 00:34:01,792
Stay where you are.

685
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,835
Put your hands up
and keep 'em up.

686

[gunshot]

688
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:42,082
I advise you to make
no move towards your gun.

689
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:43,709
Bring up the other wagon.

690
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:45,669
Now then, quickly
with those other crates.

691
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:52,217
Alright, get a move on there.
Only the ones marked Bibles.

692
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:54,803
Hey, Jeb. Look.

693
00:34:54,886 --> 00:34:56,346
Our friend Rader.

694
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:02,811
Well, this is a surprise.

695
00:35:02,894 --> 00:35:04,980
The commission
and the cavalry too, huh?

696
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:08,613
I see you've got the commission
you were after.

697
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:10,152
You know these men, Rader?

698
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:11,903
Yes, sir. Very well.

699
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:13,405
This one, Stuart,
comes from a rich

700
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:15,741
slave owning family in Virginia.

701
00:35:15,824 --> 00:35:20,037
He called you a lying renegade
once and I jumped him for it.

702
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,580
John Brown. Him?

703
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:23,081
- John Brown!
- John Brown?

704
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:24,833
I've nothing personal
against you men

705
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:27,127
but I will deal harshly
with any interference.

706
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:31,524
I might have known that you'd
wind up with this outfit.

707
00:35:31,548 --> 00:35:33,109
Well, that's one of the troubles
with the army, Stuart,

708
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:34,926
they don't teach you
to think ahead.

709
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,386
They do one smart thing.

710
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,947
They teach never to turn
your back on an enemy

711
00:35:37,971 --> 00:35:39,598
without first making sure
he's harm...

712
00:35:42,184 --> 00:35:43,685
Stop this.

713
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:45,079
We've not saddled ourselves
with the killing

714
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:47,356
just to satisfy
your personal quarrels.

715
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:49,039
One more murder
won't mark you any deeper

716
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:50,192
than you are now, Mr. Brown.

717
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:52,736
I intend to be a marked man.

718
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:55,030
Back to your horse, Rader.

719
00:35:55,113 --> 00:35:56,657
Back to your horses, all of you.

720
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,408
I've given you fair warning.

721
00:35:58,492 --> 00:36:01,870
You can keep your heads
or lose them as you wish.

722
00:36:01,953 --> 00:36:03,205
Move on.

in those cases, George.

- What?
- Contraband.

726
00:36:18,095 --> 00:36:20,180
- Riffles and ammunition.
- Gosh!

727
00:36:20,263 --> 00:36:22,766
Then we've been delivering
Bibles with triggers on 'em.

728
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:24,267
Let's take a chance.

729
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:26,561
Everybody take cover
and open fire.

730
00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:28,522

Stop! Cover the wagons
and move back.

00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:43,995
We mustn't lose anymore men.

[gunshots]

735
00:36:46,873 --> 00:36:48,542
Get back.

He's running.
They're getting away.

737
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:52,671
No, they are not.
We're going after them.

738
00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:54,754
Hey, wait a minute.
They outnumber us three to one.

739
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:57,134
Well, if it makes you nervous,
don't count them. Come on.

740
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:01,304
Everybody, mount and follow me.

741
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:02,973
Everybody, mount!

742
00:37:06,935 --> 00:37:09,354
Come on. I tell you,
here's where I get your medal.

743
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:10,605

I couldn't help it.
I didn't do anything.

00:39:04,553 --> 00:39:06,513
Alright, son,
nobody's going to hurt you.

760
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:09,140
- Who are you?
- Jason Brown.

761
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:10,809
Brown? You're one of
John Brown's sons.

762
00:39:10,892 --> 00:39:13,228
Yeah.
Yes, but I never did anything.

763
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:14,896
He made me go along.

764
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,357
I never killed anyone.
I swear it.

765
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,193
I'm getting out. I'm quitting.

766
00:39:20,277 --> 00:39:21,778
You've got to take me with you.

767
00:39:21,862 --> 00:39:24,072
Alright.
Bring a horse up, George.

768
00:39:24,155 --> 00:39:26,366
- Bring up the horses.
- We'll have to carry him back.

769
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:30,787
The boy is badly hurt.

770
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:33,957
It's his father's madness
really striking home now.

771
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,418
Jeb, there's a purpose
behind that madness.

772
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:38,753
One that can't easily
be dismissed.

773
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:44,259
George, you've seen the needle
on a compass, haven't you?

774
00:39:44,342 --> 00:39:45,969
It's got a whole car
to swing around in

775
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:48,346
but it always wobbles
back to the North.

776
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,265
What are you driving at?

777
00:39:50,348 --> 00:39:52,809
Just this. I've always known
where your sympathies lay,

778
00:39:52,893 --> 00:39:55,729
but it never affected our
friendship and it never will.

779
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:57,814
But it isn't our job
to decide who's right

780
00:39:57,898 --> 00:40:00,066
and who's wrong about slavery

781
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,860
anymore than it is John Brown's.

782
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:06,364
I guess you're right, Jeb.

783
00:40:06,448 --> 00:40:07,574
I'm sorry.

That's the most doggone fun
I've had

786
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:12,787
since we got hemmed up
with them Injuns.

787

Yeah, well, the next time

00:40:14,581 --> 00:40:15,957
you let me do the shooting.

789
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:18,335
Boy, my gullet is dry as
a powder horn.

791
00:40:23,506 --> 00:40:24,633
Get up.

792
00:40:27,844 --> 00:40:30,055
You busted Lilly's
looking glass.

793
00:40:30,138 --> 00:40:31,431
When she looks
at herself in that

794
00:40:31,514 --> 00:40:33,600
she'll think
she's a hundred years old.

795
00:40:33,683 --> 00:40:34,935
Or more.

796
00:40:36,853 --> 00:40:37,979
Of course, we're aware that

797
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:39,606
firearms are contraband
in Kansas.

798
00:40:39,689 --> 00:40:41,626
Do you think we'd have
accepted those boxes as freight

799
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,294
if we'd known
what they actually contained?

800
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:45,320
Well, I'm just asking,
that's all.

801
00:40:45,403 --> 00:40:48,198
Doesn't it seem strange to you
that Dr. J. Boyce Russell,

802
00:40:48,281 --> 00:40:50,081
the most prominent
religious leader in America

803
00:40:50,116 --> 00:40:53,578
should be sending rifles
marked as Bibles to John Brown?

804
00:40:53,662 --> 00:40:55,789
How can I control
the marking of crates?

805
00:40:55,872 --> 00:40:58,541
We once received three tons
of gunpowder marked bird seed.

806
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:00,794
Well, then you'll have to
examine every crate you haul.

807
00:41:00,877 --> 00:41:01,878
What?

808
00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:03,338
For all we know this contraband

809
00:41:03,421 --> 00:41:05,215
may have been slipping
through for months.

810
00:41:05,298 --> 00:41:08,051
Jason. Listen, son.

811
00:41:08,134 --> 00:41:11,346
You've got nothing to be afraid
of if you'll be honest with us.

812
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:13,932
Now, I want you to answer
my question truthfully.

813
00:41:14,015 --> 00:41:16,035
Did your father ever mentioned
this shipment of rifles

814
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:17,477
when he discussed his plans?

815
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,688
Not to me.

816
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:22,273
He never confided in me.

817
00:41:22,357 --> 00:41:24,567
Just Fred and Oliver.

818
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:27,862
- Fred and Oliver?
- My brothers.

819
00:41:27,946 --> 00:41:31,324
- Where are their headquarters?
- I don't know where they went.

820
00:41:31,408 --> 00:41:34,953
They have a dozen places, I...

821
00:41:35,036 --> 00:41:37,789
I don't know. I don't know.

822
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:41,668
Alright, kid.

823
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:43,211
Don't worry about it.

824

Man 6: These guns are no
mistake.

826
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,617
Anyone with their best
interest of Kansas

827
00:41:56,641 --> 00:41:58,184
at heart can tell you that.

828

Cyrus: No bendy-legged
bushwhacking soldier

829
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:01,479
can talk like that
about the Holidays.

830
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:02,915
We've got as much
interest in Kansas

831
00:42:02,939 --> 00:42:04,125
as the United States government.

832
00:42:04,149 --> 00:42:05,608
And a darn sight
more investment.

833
00:42:05,692 --> 00:42:07,110
We were here before
the army came in

834
00:42:07,193 --> 00:42:09,279
and by God we will be here
when you're gone.

835
00:42:09,362 --> 00:42:11,281
If you think you can...

836
00:42:11,364 --> 00:42:12,615
Sir.

837
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:14,409
Well, Stuart, what did you find?

838
00:42:14,492 --> 00:42:15,492
Very little, sir.

839
00:42:15,535 --> 00:42:16,554
The boy is either too badly hurt

840
00:42:16,578 --> 00:42:18,204
or too frightened to talk.

841
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:20,224
We leave immediately.
Have them sound to assembly.

842
00:42:20,248 --> 00:42:21,249
Yes, sir.

843
00:42:24,419 --> 00:42:26,171
What was that you called me?

844
00:42:26,254 --> 00:42:28,298
A gold darn
bendy-legged bushwhacker.

845
00:42:28,381 --> 00:42:29,758
Now, go on.

846
00:42:29,841 --> 00:42:32,719
He says he talks
with God at night.

847
00:42:32,802 --> 00:42:37,015
But God doesn't tell people to
kill one another, does He, miss?

848
00:42:40,268 --> 00:42:45,148
He's a, he's a good man
in a lot of ways.

849
00:42:45,231 --> 00:42:48,234
But he's changed
since Osawatomie.

850
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:51,571
Those people he killed...

851
00:42:51,654 --> 00:42:53,615
They got down on their knees

852
00:42:53,698 --> 00:42:56,409
and begged him for their lives.

853
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:59,162
But he struck them with a sword.

854
00:42:59,245 --> 00:43:02,248
Him and Rader and Kitzmiller.

855
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:04,209
I was there.

856
00:43:04,292 --> 00:43:05,919
I saw it done.

857
00:43:06,002 --> 00:43:09,631
I tried to stop them
but they pushed me aside.

858
00:43:09,714 --> 00:43:12,258
Yes, that's how it was.

859
00:43:12,342 --> 00:43:13,802
We're starting at once.

860
00:43:13,885 --> 00:43:15,804
I'll take the first troop
west to Tecumseh.

861
00:43:15,887 --> 00:43:18,973
Stuart, you and Custer will take
the first platoon of B troop

862
00:43:19,057 --> 00:43:20,517
and search thoroughly
from Clinton

863
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,310
to Dutch Henry's crossing.
Is that clear?

864
00:43:22,393 --> 00:43:24,479
- Yes, sir.
- These are your orders.

865
00:43:24,562 --> 00:43:27,065
Find John Brown
and bring him back here.

866
00:43:27,148 --> 00:43:28,691
Alive if possible.

867
00:43:28,775 --> 00:43:31,361
His force is well-armed now
and strong in numbers.

868
00:43:31,444 --> 00:43:33,113
We also suspect
that new volunteers

869
00:43:33,196 --> 00:43:35,240
are drifting in from the East
to join him.

870
00:43:35,323 --> 00:43:36,683
Be on the lookout
for them as well.

871
00:43:36,741 --> 00:43:39,536
Retire to your
respective troops.

What's that?

874
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:46,793
They've caught some more of us.

875
00:43:46,876 --> 00:43:49,879
No one's been caught, Jason.
Not even you.

876
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:52,090
You've committed no crime
to be afraid of.

877
00:43:52,173 --> 00:43:54,217
I'm sick of being afraid.

878
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,761
I'm sick of hiding
like a hunted thing.

879
00:43:56,845 --> 00:43:58,429
I want to walk free
like other people.

880
00:43:58,513 --> 00:43:59,764
You will, Jason.

881
00:43:59,848 --> 00:44:02,225
- You are safe now.
- No, I'm not.

882
00:44:02,308 --> 00:44:06,187
Not as long as he keeps killing
and thinking that he's right.

883
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,439
He can't be right, can he, miss?

884
00:44:08,523 --> 00:44:10,859
I don't know.

885
00:44:10,942 --> 00:44:13,611
His reasons may be right, Jason.

886
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:16,781
They may even be great
and good reasons.

887
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:20,994
But what your father is doing
is wrong, terribly wrong.

888
00:44:21,077 --> 00:44:25,456
And he will keep on repeating
that wrong as long as he lives.

889
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:29,752
Then, then I'll never
be free of him

890
00:44:29,836 --> 00:44:33,923
until one of us is dead.
I know that now.

891
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:36,801
My life don't mean anything.

892
00:44:36,885 --> 00:44:39,137
But if he dies

893
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,598
maybe this whole scheme of his
will die with him.

894
00:44:41,681 --> 00:44:44,184
I'd rather have it that way.

895
00:44:44,267 --> 00:44:46,603
His life...

896
00:44:46,686 --> 00:44:48,688
Even if he is my father

where to find him.

Well, Jason,
I'm not trying to...

I'm going to tell you anyway.

In the house
of Shubel Morgan, Palmyra.

That's where they went.

That's their headquarters.
Tell the soldiers!

He said he wanted me
to tell the soldiers.

00:45:38,863 --> 00:45:40,281
- Where?
- Palmyra.

917
00:45:40,365 --> 00:45:42,367
At the house of
a man named Shubel Morgan.

918
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:44,744
Shubel Morgan, Palmyra.

919
00:45:44,827 --> 00:45:49,999
- I wonder if that's the truth.
- Jeb. I'm frightened.

920

That boy is crippled for life.

921
00:45:52,585 --> 00:45:56,422
And that man on the train,
he died for principle.

922
00:45:56,506 --> 00:45:59,008
And a man killed him
for a principle.

923
00:45:59,092 --> 00:46:01,928
One of them is wrong.
But which one?

924
00:46:02,011 --> 00:46:03,638
Who knows the answer
to that, Kit.

925
00:46:03,721 --> 00:46:05,682
Everybody in America
is trying to decide it.

926
00:46:05,765 --> 00:46:08,643
Yes, by words in the East
and by guns in the West.

927
00:46:08,726 --> 00:46:11,479
But one day the words
will turn into guns.

928
00:46:11,562 --> 00:46:13,815
Oh, Jeb, can't it be
stopped now?

929
00:46:13,898 --> 00:46:16,150
Can't the slaves be free
before it's too late?

930
00:46:16,234 --> 00:46:19,279
It will be stopped
when we hang John Brown.

931
00:46:19,362 --> 00:46:21,114
Then the South can settle
our own problem

got to do with human lives?

935

Kit, the two things kind of
come together down South.

936
00:46:31,916 --> 00:46:34,127
We can't pry them apart.
Not even with guns.

937
00:46:36,587 --> 00:46:38,715
I hope that's going to be
the same way with us.

Ah, I've seen your work before,
son. That's where I learned.

00:47:02,238 --> 00:47:04,449
Hear that?

947
00:47:04,532 --> 00:47:06,117
- Don't be long, Jeb.
- Oh, no, no, no.

948
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,494
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

949
00:47:08,578 --> 00:47:11,456
Kit, remember this, will you?
I love you.

950
00:47:11,539 --> 00:47:12,933
Put that in your little bonnet
and keep it there

951
00:47:12,957 --> 00:47:14,167
until I come back.

952
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:15,960
- I'll remember.
- Goodbye.

Tex: Hey, lieutenant.

954
00:47:22,967 --> 00:47:24,802
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, Lieutenant Jeb.

955
00:47:24,886 --> 00:47:26,030
Say, I want you to keep
an eye on Kit for me

956
00:47:26,054 --> 00:47:27,597
while we're gone, will you?

957
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,640
No. We're going to hunting
John Brown with you.

958
00:47:29,724 --> 00:47:30,909
- What?
- Yeah, we've come to join up.

959
00:47:30,933 --> 00:47:32,518
Who do we see?

960
00:47:32,602 --> 00:47:34,771
A couple of flat-footed rumpots
like you in the army?

961
00:47:34,854 --> 00:47:36,397
Why, you would get lost.

962
00:47:36,481 --> 00:47:37,958
Boys, you better go home
and sleep it off. So long.

He's dead.

If you find John Brown,
tell him.

969
00:48:25,321 --> 00:48:28,074
We'll try to find him. Goodbye.

[instrumental music]

971
00:48:45,383 --> 00:48:48,428
Kit, once when you were
about this high

972
00:48:48,511 --> 00:48:52,014
Tex and Windy brought home
a wolf cub with a broken back.

973
00:48:52,098 --> 00:48:53,558
You nursed it for weeks

974
00:48:53,641 --> 00:48:56,394
but it finally died
with his head in your lap.

975
00:48:56,477 --> 00:48:58,312
You cried for days.

976
00:48:58,396 --> 00:49:00,231
But it was just a wolf cub.

977
00:49:00,314 --> 00:49:03,818
It would probably have grown up
to be a killer like its father.

[instrumental music]

979
00:49:16,497 --> 00:49:19,375
What does being flat-footed
got to do with riding a horse?

980
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:21,836
Calling me a rumpot
is what hurt me.

981
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,463
I ain't had a drink since noon.

[instrumental music]

985
00:50:02,043 --> 00:50:04,587
It sure is expensive salt pork,
Mr. Morgan sir.

986
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:06,088
Not the way we get 'em.

987
00:50:06,172 --> 00:50:07,274
Round 'em over
and stack 'em in the barn.

988
00:50:07,298 --> 00:50:08,508
Yes, sir.

989
00:50:08,591 --> 00:50:09,610
This looks like
the best shipment

990
00:50:09,634 --> 00:50:11,344
we've had yet.

991
00:50:11,427 --> 00:50:13,054
Wonder what Rader's
worked up about?

992
00:50:13,137 --> 00:50:14,781
Him and the old man
been arguing for an hour.

993
00:50:14,805 --> 00:50:17,767
Looks like another job for us
if Rader thought of it.

994
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:20,311
West born education
is a wonderful thing.

995
00:50:20,394 --> 00:50:21,646
Yeah, if you can collect on it.

996
00:50:21,729 --> 00:50:23,147
Yeah.

997
00:50:23,231 --> 00:50:25,942
I signed up because
you promised to pay me.

998
00:50:26,025 --> 00:50:27,777
Train this rabble gang of yours

999
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:31,030
into a solid fast moving
unit of fighters.

1000
00:50:31,113 --> 00:50:33,574
Taught 'em how to use these new
rifles, how to follow orders

1001
00:50:33,658 --> 00:50:36,077
and take a town in army fashion.

1002
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,746
But I haven't received
a red cent in three months.

1003
00:50:38,829 --> 00:50:41,123
Now, what about it?

1004
00:50:41,207 --> 00:50:43,668
Mr. Rader, I enlisted you
on the recommendation

1005
00:50:43,751 --> 00:50:46,879
of friends in the East, who said
you would work for the cause.

1006
00:50:46,963 --> 00:50:50,341
You've done the job well.
I've no complaint up to now.

1007
00:50:50,424 --> 00:50:53,261
But our plans are ahead
of any personal greed.

1008
00:50:53,344 --> 00:50:55,721
If you feel otherwise,
you are free to get out.

1009
00:50:55,805 --> 00:50:58,224
But you must decide
here and now.

1010
00:50:58,307 --> 00:51:00,226
I want only loyal men around me.

1011
00:51:06,691 --> 00:51:08,568
You've no argument
with my loyalty.

1012
00:51:08,651 --> 00:51:09,944
I proved that in Osawatomie

1013
00:51:10,027 --> 00:51:12,113
and every other town
we've raided.

1014
00:51:12,196 --> 00:51:14,699
But you hired me as a
military expert at a set price

1015
00:51:14,782 --> 00:51:16,867
and I'm only asking
what's rightly due me.

1016
00:51:16,951 --> 00:51:19,495
And I say that
you'll receive it in time.

1017
00:51:19,579 --> 00:51:21,747
Only let me think in peace.

1018
00:51:21,831 --> 00:51:24,166
My son is a prisoner
in the hands of our enemies.

1019
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:26,919
Even now he may have
a rope around his neck.

1020
00:51:27,003 --> 00:51:30,673
An innocent boy who never fired
a gun in anger in his life.

1021
00:51:30,756 --> 00:51:34,760
While I stand here
powerless to save him.

1022
00:51:34,844 --> 00:51:36,887
Alright, I'll wait.

1023
00:51:36,971 --> 00:51:38,639
Well, what's our next move?

1024
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:48,482
The Bible has said, "An eye for
an eye and a tooth for a tooth."

1025
00:51:48,566 --> 00:51:51,819
Tomorrow at daybreak we will
destroy Delaware crossing.

Well, what the...

1031
00:52:20,097 --> 00:52:21,807
Well, the major sort of
turned us down too.

1032
00:52:21,891 --> 00:52:23,851
But here we are, Lieutenant Jeb.

1033
00:52:23,934 --> 00:52:26,062
What do you mean trailing us
halfway across Kansas?

We don't want you to get lost.

of this here country

just like my own face.

1037
00:52:31,025 --> 00:52:32,502
Well, you're sure
that's just as dirty?

1038
00:52:32,526 --> 00:52:34,129
I've got a good mind
to get a couple of mules

1039
00:52:34,153 --> 00:52:36,405
and strap you on the back
and send you home.

A fine looking
pair of soldiers you make.

1041
00:52:39,241 --> 00:52:41,535
Well, we needed some of them
pants and a cap.

1042

And then of course
there's some soldiers

why...

to the end of the column.

Go on before I get that mule.

We don't have to obey no orders.

1047

John Brown.

How many men did he have
with him?

1058
00:54:03,743 --> 00:54:06,579
Around a hundred. Maybe more.

1059
00:54:06,662 --> 00:54:11,041
- How long since he left?
- Three, four hours.

that had the run in

on the train.

we'd get him some day

if he didn't get us first.

to help you bury your dead.

Let's see you back

of John Brown myself.

1102
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:28,929
Please, Captain Brown.
What do that mean?

1103
00:56:29,013 --> 00:56:31,682
- What you gonna do with us?
- It means that you are free.

1104
00:56:31,765 --> 00:56:33,851
The first of many millions
to whom I shall

1105
00:56:33,934 --> 00:56:35,853
give freedom from slavery.

1106
00:56:35,936 --> 00:56:39,398
Does, does just saying so
make us free?

1107
00:56:39,481 --> 00:56:42,610
How we gonna live?
Get food and shelter?

1108
00:56:42,693 --> 00:56:44,987
There are many good people
in Kansas who will give you

1109
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:47,072
work and protection.

1110
00:56:47,156 --> 00:56:49,700
From now on,
you must fend for yourselves

1111
00:56:49,783 --> 00:56:51,702
as other free men do.

1112
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,622
My work here is done.

1113
00:56:54,705 --> 00:56:58,459
- Praise the lord!
- Glory bliss! God, we's free.

1114
00:56:58,542 --> 00:57:00,753
The captain done tip his word,
we's free!

1115
00:57:00,836 --> 00:57:02,838
We's free! We's free!

[indistinct singing]

1117
00:57:16,977 --> 00:57:18,687
You know,
if John Brown is a 100 men

1118
00:57:18,771 --> 00:57:21,357
we better send a runner back,
bring up the rest of the troop.

1119
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,734
Better do it tonight.

1120
00:57:23,817 --> 00:57:25,319
I'm going into Palmyra, George.

1121
00:57:25,402 --> 00:57:27,863
You, alone? Don't be crazy, Jeb.

1122
00:57:27,947 --> 00:57:30,783
That town's full of jayhawkers,
they'd shoot you on sight.

1123
00:57:30,866 --> 00:57:32,660
Well, I'll have to take
a chance on that.

1124
00:57:32,743 --> 00:57:34,554
I'm gonna get some other
clothes, take a couple of men

1125
00:57:34,578 --> 00:57:36,580
and go in and do some scouting.

1126
00:57:36,664 --> 00:57:37,904
I'll try to send you back word.

1127
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,585
Good luck.

1128
00:57:41,669 --> 00:57:43,521
Jeb: Say, do you two fellows
still want to join the army?

1129
00:57:43,545 --> 00:57:45,005
- Huh?!
- I've got a job for you.

1130
00:57:45,089 --> 00:57:46,632
It's no picnic,
it's pretty dangerous.

1131
00:57:46,715 --> 00:57:49,134
But I think you're the fellows
for it. What do you say?

1132
00:57:49,218 --> 00:57:51,470
Do you mean we're gonna have
a real cap and a uniform?

1133
00:57:51,553 --> 00:57:52,846
Mm-hm.

1134
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:54,240
Well, we might have to be buried
in 'em.

1135
00:57:54,264 --> 00:57:56,183
But it sure sounds like a deal.

1136
00:57:57,768 --> 00:58:00,688
[dramatic music]

1137
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,702
The law has got nothing
to do with it.

1138
00:58:14,785 --> 00:58:17,079
We came here to join John Brown

1139
00:58:17,162 --> 00:58:19,623
because he's a leader,
and a fighter!

1140
00:58:19,707 --> 00:58:23,043
The whole thing's going to be
settled right here in Kansas.

1141
00:58:23,127 --> 00:58:25,754
We came here to fight slavers,
didn't we?

1142
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:29,967
The only way to fight 'em
is with guns!

1143
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:32,386
Sure give a good lookin' over
in this here's man town.

1144
00:58:32,469 --> 00:58:35,264
Yeah, I feel just like I was
takin' a bath in a bath tub

1145
00:58:35,347 --> 00:58:36,640
without no sides on it.

1146
00:58:36,724 --> 00:58:39,059
The only kind of a tub
you ever was in.

1147
00:58:39,143 --> 00:58:40,870
Say, who could I talk to
in this kind of a town

1148
00:58:40,894 --> 00:58:42,813
without arising suspicion?

1149
00:58:42,896 --> 00:58:45,024
- The town barber.
- That's right.

1150
00:58:45,107 --> 00:58:47,067
Anytime a barber can't talk
to a stranger

1151
00:58:47,151 --> 00:58:49,028
he's liable to go crazy.

1152
00:58:49,111 --> 00:58:51,488
The town barber. Hm.

1153
00:58:51,572 --> 00:58:53,115
That's it.

1154
00:58:53,198 --> 00:58:56,118
[instrumental music]

1155

- Howdy, boys.
- Howdy.

1156
00:59:10,174 --> 00:59:12,259
Pretty good looking horse
for this part of the world.

1157
00:59:12,342 --> 00:59:13,635
Yeah.

1158
00:59:13,719 --> 00:59:15,471
Kansas is alright
for men and dogs

1159
00:59:15,554 --> 00:59:17,681
but it's pretty hard
on women and horses.

1160
00:59:17,765 --> 00:59:18,974
[chuckling]

1161
00:59:19,058 --> 00:59:21,852
Say, look at that brand.

1162
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:28,442
That's an army horse.

1163
00:59:31,612 --> 00:59:33,697
Maybe just bought him
from someone.

1164
00:59:33,781 --> 00:59:35,991
No, they don't sell 'em.

1165
00:59:36,075 --> 00:59:38,035
Nobody rides that brand
but a soldier.

1166
00:59:39,828 --> 00:59:41,914
You keep your eye on him
till I get back.

1167
00:59:46,794 --> 00:59:48,837
You still got that creepy
feeling about this place?

1168
00:59:48,921 --> 00:59:50,964
I don't know whether it's that
or here chiggers.

1169
00:59:51,048 --> 00:59:53,133
But something's creeping
over me.

1170
00:59:53,217 --> 00:59:55,135
Why don't you scratch
and see if it goes away.

1171
01:00:01,892 --> 01:00:04,311
Yeah, I reckon
that is all it was.

1172
01:00:04,394 --> 01:00:05,979
Say, I got it now.

1173
01:00:06,063 --> 01:00:07,903
We was on the same train
a couple of months ago

1174
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:09,608
when that fellow got killed.

1175
01:00:09,691 --> 01:00:11,836
Uh-huh. You probably got me
mixed up with somebody else.

1176
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:14,279
No siree. I never forget a face.

1177
01:00:14,363 --> 01:00:15,882
Although,
I was little drunk at the time.

1178
01:00:15,906 --> 01:00:17,282
Well, there you are.

1179
01:00:17,366 --> 01:00:19,618
The fellow you saw
probably had two faces.

1180
01:00:19,701 --> 01:00:22,037
- Been in Palmyra long?
- Oh, just a couple of weeks.

1181
01:00:22,121 --> 01:00:23,580
This ain't no town for barbers.

1182
01:00:23,664 --> 01:00:25,266
The fellows that ain't trying to
hide their faces

1183
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:28,335
for some reason or other
are too mean to spend the money.

1184
01:00:28,418 --> 01:00:30,647
Yes, I've heard you got some
pretty tough customers here.

1185
01:00:30,671 --> 01:00:33,173
Tough? Say! I'm afraid
to shave half of them.

1186
01:00:33,257 --> 01:00:35,008
Afraid they'll get up
and cut my throat.

1187
01:00:35,092 --> 01:00:37,928
[chuckles] Say, do you ever run
across this famous...

1188
01:00:38,011 --> 01:00:41,306
- What's his name, John Brown?
- Sure, he came in here once.

1189
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:43,392
Strange looking man,
with a hit mark on his throat.

1190
01:00:43,475 --> 01:00:44,726
Jeb: Hit mark? What's that?

1191
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:46,937
Oh, it's an old barber
superstition.

1192
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:49,690
A little red line that runs
all the way around here.

1193
01:00:49,773 --> 01:00:52,359
Anybody born with that mark
is bound to be hung.

1194
01:00:52,442 --> 01:00:53,819
That so?

1195
01:00:53,902 --> 01:00:56,155
Say, I haven't got one, have I?

1196
01:00:56,238 --> 01:00:58,448
Not yet. Maybe.

1197
01:01:03,704 --> 01:01:06,039
Well, well.

1198
01:01:06,123 --> 01:01:07,875
Keep your hand away.

1199
01:01:08,792 --> 01:01:10,210
Get it.

1200
01:01:15,424 --> 01:01:18,385
This was quite an idea, Stuart.

1201
01:01:18,468 --> 01:01:20,637
You coming in alone first
to look around.

1202
01:01:22,764 --> 01:01:24,224
Is this one of your agents?

1203
01:01:24,308 --> 01:01:25,809
I ain't never laid eyes
on him before.

1204
01:01:25,893 --> 01:01:28,437
I swear it.
I-I don't know him from Adam.

1205
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,981
What were you up to?

1206
01:01:31,064 --> 01:01:33,066
Well, it's your move.
You figure it out.

1207
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:36,028
My next move is plain enough.

1208
01:01:36,111 --> 01:01:37,696
Didn't they teach us
how to handle spies

1209
01:01:37,779 --> 01:01:39,323
when we caught 'em red-handed?

1210
01:01:39,406 --> 01:01:41,116
Same treatment for renegades,
wasn't it?

1211
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,535
When you catch 'em.

1212
01:01:43,619 --> 01:01:45,370
This will make you quite a hero,
Stuart.

1213
01:01:45,454 --> 01:01:49,249
The class of '54 will turn out
in a body for your funeral.

1214
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:51,710
They may even hang your picture
in the West Point Library.

1215
01:01:51,793 --> 01:01:53,587
There's worst places to hang.

1216
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:56,173
Get him out of here, Rader.
We're wasting time.

1217
01:01:56,256 --> 01:02:00,052
Just having a last few words
with an old classmate of mine.

1218
01:02:00,135 --> 01:02:02,179
And I had them coming to me.

1219
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:07,893
Come on, get up.

1220
01:02:07,976 --> 01:02:10,771
We're gonna give you a good look
at what you came to see.

1221
01:02:24,493 --> 01:02:26,245
We can't afford
to take chances, sir.

1222
01:02:26,328 --> 01:02:28,956
He was sent here as a spy. It's
my advice to get rid of him.

1223
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:31,583
- Let's string him up.
- Goddamn right.

1224
01:02:31,667 --> 01:02:35,212
What did you hope to achieve
by coming alone to Palmyra?

1225
01:02:35,295 --> 01:02:36,755
The army has orders
from Washington

1226
01:02:36,838 --> 01:02:38,382
to bring you to trial.

1227
01:02:38,465 --> 01:02:40,509
I hoped that if I came
face to face with you first

1228
01:02:40,592 --> 01:02:42,594
a lot of unnecessary bloodshed
might be avoided

1229
01:02:42,678 --> 01:02:44,096
for your men and mine.

1230
01:02:44,179 --> 01:02:45,782
Were you innocent enough
to think that I would

1231
01:02:45,806 --> 01:02:48,350
surrender myself to you
without a fight?

1232
01:02:48,433 --> 01:02:50,018
I hope that you might
consider yourself

1233
01:02:50,102 --> 01:02:51,895
innocent enough to do that.

1234
01:02:51,979 --> 01:02:54,356
Half of the people in America
believe in your theory.

1235
01:02:54,439 --> 01:02:56,233
A lot of them even condone
your methods.

1236
01:02:56,316 --> 01:02:58,110
That'll guarantee you
a public trial.

1237
01:02:58,193 --> 01:03:00,112
Fool.

1238
01:03:00,195 --> 01:03:03,490
I'm not on trial,
but the nation itself.

1239
01:03:03,573 --> 01:03:07,786
Are you too stupid and blinded
by a uniform to see what I see?

1240
01:03:07,869 --> 01:03:11,623
A dark and evil curse
laying all over this land.

1241
01:03:11,707 --> 01:03:14,710
A carnal sin against God.

1242
01:03:14,793 --> 01:03:16,295
It can only be wiped out
in blood.

1243
01:03:16,378 --> 01:03:18,088
But why in blood?

1244
01:03:18,171 --> 01:03:20,108
The people of the Virginia
have considered a resolution

1245
01:03:20,132 --> 01:03:22,301
to abolish slavery
for a long time.

1246
01:03:22,384 --> 01:03:24,720
They sense that it's
a moral wrong.

1247
01:03:24,803 --> 01:03:27,639
And the rest of the South
will follow Virginia's example.

1248
01:03:27,723 --> 01:03:30,851
- All I ask is time.
- Time?

1249
01:03:30,934 --> 01:03:32,311
[yells] Time?

1250
01:03:32,394 --> 01:03:34,313
For 30 years,
I waited for the South

1251
01:03:34,396 --> 01:03:36,356
to cleanse it's soul
of this crime.

1252
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,025
Since childhood
I've been possessed

1253
01:03:38,108 --> 01:03:41,278
with the fire of correcting
this wrong.

1254
01:03:41,361 --> 01:03:43,780
I tried peaceful agitation.

1255
01:03:43,864 --> 01:03:45,907
As God as my witness, I tried.

1256
01:03:47,576 --> 01:03:49,578
Peaceful means failed long ago.

1257
01:03:49,661 --> 01:03:51,330
Now I shall force a decision

1258
01:03:51,413 --> 01:03:54,333
by bringing both side
into armed conflict.

1259
01:03:54,416 --> 01:03:57,336
Letters, words, talk,
the time has ended for that.

1260
01:03:57,419 --> 01:03:59,212
Strength and action
are wanted now.

1261
01:03:59,296 --> 01:04:00,881
Not a voice crying
in the wilderness

1262
01:04:00,964 --> 01:04:04,509
but a David armed
with the power and the glory.

1263
01:04:04,593 --> 01:04:07,679
- David had a son, hadn't he?
- A son?

1264
01:04:07,763 --> 01:04:09,639
Yes, Absalom,
who deserted his father

1265
01:04:09,723 --> 01:04:11,558
and went over to the enemy.

1266
01:04:15,812 --> 01:04:18,065
What're you trying to tell me,
Stuart?

1267
01:04:18,148 --> 01:04:20,400
And Absalom died
because he feared his father.

1268
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:25,405
Jason is dead!

1269
01:04:26,656 --> 01:04:28,658
So be it.

1270
01:04:28,742 --> 01:04:32,079
My son has paid for the sins
of this world with his life

1271
01:04:32,162 --> 01:04:34,331
as once did the son of God.

1272
01:04:35,457 --> 01:04:37,376
It shall not be in vain.

1273
01:04:39,336 --> 01:04:40,813
Whether you kill me or not
my army will

1274
01:04:40,837 --> 01:04:42,923
crush you all in the end.

1275
01:04:43,006 --> 01:04:45,717
My advice to you is to find
peace with your maker.

1276
01:04:51,431 --> 01:04:54,184
Man 7: Now the big one.
Sit down.

1277
01:04:54,267 --> 01:04:56,269
I never liked barber's know-how.

1278
01:04:56,353 --> 01:04:58,271
Now spill out,
you little, pitirim weasel.

1279
01:04:58,355 --> 01:04:59,773
I'll cut your throat!
Where'd he go?

1280
01:04:59,856 --> 01:05:01,733
I swear, I don't know, boys,
uh, well,

1281
01:05:01,817 --> 01:05:03,127
th... th... they've took him out
that way.

1282
01:05:03,151 --> 01:05:04,653
- Who took him?
- T... three fellas.

1283
01:05:04,736 --> 01:05:06,655
One of them was Oliver Brown.

1284
01:05:10,826 --> 01:05:12,994
Do you see this razor?
Well, I'm keepin' it.

1285
01:05:13,078 --> 01:05:15,014
If you moved a hair when we get
back, I'm gonna strop it

1286
01:05:15,038 --> 01:05:17,249
on your liver
and barbecue your carcass.

1287
01:05:17,332 --> 01:05:19,251
Now you stay where you are.

I called you all together
as witnesses

1292
01:05:41,857 --> 01:05:43,859
to hear my words.

1293
01:05:43,942 --> 01:05:46,069
An enemy to the cause
has entered our midst

1294
01:05:46,153 --> 01:05:47,696
stealthily, and by night.

1295
01:05:47,779 --> 01:05:50,740
With the purpose of planning our
destruction.

1296
01:05:50,824 --> 01:05:52,242
The hand that has never
failed us

1297
01:05:52,325 --> 01:05:54,202
has come once again
to our protection.

1298
01:05:54,286 --> 01:05:57,998
It's not with malice or revenge
that we take this man's life

1299
01:05:58,081 --> 01:05:59,416
but in just retribution.

1300

and when they'd growed up
and took on too much corn liquor

Huh. Is that what made you
leave home?

he is gonna give us freedom

So we'll sing our reminiscences.

1412
01:14:44,899 --> 01:14:47,735
Of Benny Havens' oh.

1413
01:14:47,819 --> 01:14:51,197
Old Benny Havens' oh.

1414
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:54,075
Old Benny Havens' oh.

1415
01:14:54,158 --> 01:15:00,248
We'll sing our reminiscences.

1416
01:15:00,331 --> 01:15:03,960
Of Benny Havens' oh

1417
01:15:04,043 --> 01:15:05,962
[applauding]

1418
01:15:07,255 --> 01:15:09,173
[instrumental music]

1419
01:15:10,883 --> 01:15:12,135
Congratulations, boys.

1420
01:15:12,218 --> 01:15:14,387
- Thanks, sir.
- That was excellent.

1421
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:16,556
I didn't recognize the song.
Where does it come from?

1422
01:15:16,639 --> 01:15:18,725
It's an old army song,
a farewell.

1423
01:15:18,808 --> 01:15:20,285
These young men
have all been promoted

1424
01:15:20,309 --> 01:15:21,769
and are ordered back
to Washington.

1425
01:15:21,853 --> 01:15:23,479
- That's splendid.
- You, lucky devils!

1426
01:15:23,563 --> 01:15:25,898
I had to wait ten years
for my captaincy.

1427
01:15:25,982 --> 01:15:27,692
And I also followed tradition
by proposing

1428
01:15:27,775 --> 01:15:29,819
to my wife the same night.

1429
01:15:29,902 --> 01:15:30,963
Would you like some
refreshments?

1430
01:15:30,987 --> 01:15:32,780
- Yes, I would.
- Splendid idea.

1431
01:15:35,825 --> 01:15:37,493
Well, I think I'll run down
to the stable.

1432
01:15:37,577 --> 01:15:39,579
Horse threw a shoe this morning.
Ah. See you later.

1433
01:15:39,662 --> 01:15:41,664
I'll go with you,
maybe I can find it.

1434
01:15:47,879 --> 01:15:49,255
Why did you have to go
and lie for

1435
01:15:49,338 --> 01:15:50,938
tellin' the major
we is the best barbeque

1436
01:15:51,007 --> 01:15:52,341
along the Santa Fe trail?

1437
01:15:52,425 --> 01:15:54,635
Oh, I just mentioned it
sort of casual.

1438
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:56,429
How'd I know he was gonna
take us up on it?

1439
01:15:56,512 --> 01:15:58,097
Wait till he starts eating this.

1440
01:15:58,181 --> 01:16:00,892
[scoffs] He won't take us up,
he'd take us up and out.

1441
01:16:00,975 --> 01:16:03,394
Do you think it's gonna be hard
chewing, Tex?

1442
01:16:03,478 --> 01:16:06,731
Well, I don't know,
I still got a hunch

1443
01:16:06,814 --> 01:16:09,275
we should've skinned it first.

1444
01:16:09,358 --> 01:16:11,277
We took the horns off of it,
didn't we?

1445
01:16:13,946 --> 01:16:15,865
What is a captain's pay, Jeb,
$38?

1446
01:16:15,948 --> 01:16:17,992
- Uh-uh, $40.
- Forty a month.

1447
01:16:18,076 --> 01:16:19,077
[whistling]

1448
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:21,370
Say, that's enough to get..

1449
01:16:21,454 --> 01:16:23,265
- Go on, get what?
- Well, you know, this and that.

1450
01:16:23,289 --> 01:16:25,208
What're you planning to do
with your extra pay?

1451
01:16:29,087 --> 01:16:32,131
Exactly the same thing
as you are, son.

1452
01:16:32,215 --> 01:16:33,841
- Want to draw straws?
- Not this time.

1453
01:16:33,925 --> 01:16:35,468
This means too much.

1454
01:16:35,551 --> 01:16:37,512
Well, how're we gonna
handle it then? Take turns?

1455
01:16:37,595 --> 01:16:41,224
I don't trust you Southern boys
in the moon light.

1456
01:16:41,307 --> 01:16:43,559
Alright, let's ask her together.

1457
01:16:46,979 --> 01:16:48,564
- Hey!
- Wait a minute.

1458
01:16:48,648 --> 01:16:50,983
- What is this? You lunatics!
- Come on. Don't argue..

1459
01:16:51,067 --> 01:16:52,985
Just come along and listen.

1460
01:16:55,988 --> 01:16:57,156
There you are.

1461
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:58,950
George has got something
to ask you, Kit.

1462
01:16:59,033 --> 01:17:00,409
You have the floor, George.

1463
01:17:00,493 --> 01:17:03,079
Well, I don't know
just how to start, Kit.

1464
01:17:03,162 --> 01:17:04,723
But there's an old Indian woman
who hangs around

1465
01:17:04,747 --> 01:17:06,183
the fort
and tells people's fortunes.

1466
01:17:06,207 --> 01:17:08,292
She is supposed to be
a wonder at it and..

1467
01:17:08,376 --> 01:17:11,254
- Well..
- Yes, George?

1468
01:17:11,337 --> 01:17:13,923
Well, she said I'm going
to get married soon

1469
01:17:14,006 --> 01:17:15,883
to a very beautiful girl.

1470
01:17:15,967 --> 01:17:17,844
Did she, George?
That's very nice.

1471
01:17:17,927 --> 01:17:20,930
Pretty slick opening remark.

1472
01:17:21,013 --> 01:17:24,976
Kit, were you ever by any chance
a blonde?

1473
01:17:25,059 --> 01:17:27,854
- Why? No. Not even as a baby.
- Are you sure?

1474
01:17:27,937 --> 01:17:29,939
This old woman
has never been wrong before.

1475
01:17:30,022 --> 01:17:32,567
- Absolutely sure.
- Well, maybe she's still right.

1476
01:17:32,650 --> 01:17:35,045
There's a whole lot of beautiful
blondes in the world, George.

1477
01:17:35,069 --> 01:17:36,487
Let's ask her.

1478
01:17:36,571 --> 01:17:38,823
- Let's.
- Wait a minute.

1479
01:17:38,906 --> 01:17:43,286
Kit, are you in love with him
and not with me?

1480
01:17:43,369 --> 01:17:44,912
I guess I am, George.

1481
01:17:44,996 --> 01:17:46,723
- You're gonna marry him?
- Oh, wait a minute.

1482
01:17:46,747 --> 01:17:49,250
I can handle this proposal
from now, son.

1483
01:17:49,333 --> 01:17:51,043
Kit, you really mean that?

1484
01:17:51,127 --> 01:17:53,004
You haven't asked me
anything yet.

1485
01:17:54,297 --> 01:17:55,882
I wonder if I said
the wrong thing.

1486
01:17:55,965 --> 01:17:58,801
Mm-mm-mm, couldn't have been
more perfect.

1487
01:17:58,885 --> 01:18:00,678
Now where's that Indian?

1488
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:07,560
[instrumental music]

1489
01:18:12,273 --> 01:18:15,193
[chanting in foreign language]

1490
01:18:26,162 --> 01:18:28,289
What she saying, Kit?
You know the lingo.

1491
01:18:28,372 --> 01:18:30,208
She says that this is
one of the last times

1492
01:18:30,291 --> 01:18:32,835
we'll all of us be together
as friends.

1493
01:18:32,919 --> 01:18:34,837
[all laughing]

1494
01:18:34,921 --> 01:18:36,297
Now ask her something sensible.

1495
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:39,133
Who is gonna be
the first general?

1496
01:18:39,217 --> 01:18:42,136
[speaking foreign language]

1497
01:18:49,018 --> 01:18:51,896
She says that one day
you'll all be famous men.

1498
01:18:51,979 --> 01:18:53,731
Great in battle.

1499
01:18:53,814 --> 01:18:55,608
But bitter enemies.

1500
01:18:59,153 --> 01:19:01,239
Pickett, Hood, Custer, Sheridan,
Longstreet

1501
01:19:01,322 --> 01:19:03,241
and me enemies?
Now I know she's crazy.

1502
01:19:03,324 --> 01:19:05,219
Where did you ever pickup
this old figure, George?

1503
01:19:05,243 --> 01:19:07,703
I can tell better fortunes
than that with tea leaves.

1504
01:19:07,787 --> 01:19:09,097
Well, we might as well get
our money's worth.

1505
01:19:09,121 --> 01:19:10,224
Ask what we're gonna
fight about.

1506
01:19:10,248 --> 01:19:12,583
Yeah, who is gonna start it?

1507
01:19:12,667 --> 01:19:15,586
[speaking foreign language]

1508
01:19:32,103 --> 01:19:34,897
Well, what's this?
Too ridiculous to tell?

1509
01:19:34,981 --> 01:19:38,317
She says,
the fight has already started.

1510
01:19:38,401 --> 01:19:41,612
Somewhere in the east,
a man is lighting a torch.

1511
01:19:41,696 --> 01:19:43,990
Now, at this very moment.

1512
01:19:44,073 --> 01:19:46,867
The two of us will help
to kill him.

1513
01:19:46,951 --> 01:19:48,869
But none of us can stop him.

1514
01:19:58,629 --> 01:20:01,549
[laughing]

1515
01:20:08,806 --> 01:20:10,975
Here is where
I would attack first.

1516
01:20:11,058 --> 01:20:13,227
The arsenal at Harpers Ferry.

1517
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:16,230
Give me only a 100 good men,
Dr. Russell.

1518
01:20:16,314 --> 01:20:19,984
Well armed and God-fearing men
who believe in the cause.

1519
01:20:20,067 --> 01:20:21,736
I will lead them through
Virginia.

1520
01:20:21,819 --> 01:20:24,071
Arouse the thousands
of discontented slaves

1521
01:20:24,155 --> 01:20:25,489
who will flock to join us.

1522
01:20:25,573 --> 01:20:27,158
Then sweep down through
the south.

1523
01:20:27,241 --> 01:20:30,494
Through the Carolinas,
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi

1524
01:20:30,578 --> 01:20:33,080
then with the entire nation
in the state of chaos

1525
01:20:33,164 --> 01:20:34,999
we can dictate our own terms.

1526
01:20:35,082 --> 01:20:37,835
Have you considered the army,
Captain Brown?

1527
01:20:37,918 --> 01:20:39,628
Surely, they'll be after you
in full force

1528
01:20:39,712 --> 01:20:41,380
within a few hours
after you first attack.

1529
01:20:41,464 --> 01:20:44,633
Let them come, Dr. Russell.
Let them try to stop me.

1530
01:20:44,717 --> 01:20:46,469
I've studied that country
for years.

1531
01:20:46,552 --> 01:20:47,887
It's full of good hiding places

1532
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:50,348
natural forts where large forces
of brave men

1533
01:20:50,431 --> 01:20:52,141
can defy pursuit indefinitely.

1534
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:55,478
Mr. Rader will go ahead of us
and scout the town.

1535
01:20:55,561 --> 01:20:57,104
With his knowledge
of military methods

1536
01:20:57,188 --> 01:20:59,315
and our great advantage
of surprise

1537
01:20:59,398 --> 01:21:01,275
we can outwit the army
at every turn.

1538
01:21:01,359 --> 01:21:03,277
Captain Brown,
this plan of yours is mad.

1539
01:21:03,361 --> 01:21:05,237
Worse than mad,
it's high treason.

1540
01:21:05,321 --> 01:21:07,990
Such a brazen attack
would lead to civil war.

1541
01:21:08,074 --> 01:21:10,826
Exactly!
That is exactly what I want.

1542
01:21:10,910 --> 01:21:13,537
Is it your wish then to destroy
the union?

1543
01:21:13,621 --> 01:21:17,249
My answer to that is yes.
To the devil with the union.

1544
01:21:17,333 --> 01:21:21,128
We've got to fight sometime,
it might as well be now.

1545
01:21:21,212 --> 01:21:23,172
[murmuring]

1546
01:21:23,255 --> 01:21:26,467
Gentlemen, I came here to Boston
at great personal risk.

1547
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:28,636
There's a price on my head
of $10,000.

1548
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:31,097
So, my time is precious.

1549
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:34,683
You've given me much help
and encouragement up to now.

1550
01:21:34,767 --> 01:21:37,061
But all that we've done
in Kansas and elsewhere

1551
01:21:37,144 --> 01:21:38,604
will be all wasted

1552
01:21:38,687 --> 01:21:41,273
unless you see it through
to the glorious end.

1553
01:21:45,778 --> 01:21:47,947
How much money will you need?

1554
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:50,950
[dramatic music]

1555
01:21:55,413 --> 01:21:57,123
We now possess the guns,
ammunition

1556
01:21:57,206 --> 01:21:59,375
pikes, a complete store
of supplies.

1557
01:21:59,458 --> 01:22:01,585
To place in the RSF,
Harpers Ferry

1558
01:22:01,669 --> 01:22:03,421
day break, Monday,
October the 16th.

1559
01:22:03,504 --> 01:22:05,982
We must strike with two forces,
suddenly with complete surprise

1560
01:22:06,006 --> 01:22:08,384
and then move rapidly
through Virginia.

1561
01:22:08,467 --> 01:22:10,070
You men all know what will be
demanded of you.

1562
01:22:10,094 --> 01:22:12,138
- Yes, we are waiting, captain.
- Captain.

1563
01:22:15,683 --> 01:22:18,394
It's Rader. He made good time.

1564
01:22:28,154 --> 01:22:30,114
Well, what did you find?

1565
01:22:30,197 --> 01:22:32,366
Speak up. Is anything wrong
at Harpers Ferry.

1566
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:34,010
Well, the town itself
won't any trouble.

1567
01:22:34,034 --> 01:22:35,929
There's a bridge at the
Baltimore and Ohio railroad

1568
01:22:35,953 --> 01:22:36,972
to be blocked
and we got to cut that

1569
01:22:36,996 --> 01:22:38,372
telegraph line to Washington.

1570
01:22:38,456 --> 01:22:39,999
What about the government
arsenal?

1571
01:22:40,082 --> 01:22:42,585
It's guarded by only two men.

1572
01:22:42,668 --> 01:22:44,420
Here, I made this rough map
of the place.

1573
01:22:47,256 --> 01:22:48,549
Good. Excellent.

1574
01:22:48,632 --> 01:22:50,509
This is precisely what I wanted.

1575
01:22:50,593 --> 01:22:52,320
We must first take
some hostages from the town

1576
01:22:52,344 --> 01:22:53,738
that'll prevent an attack
by the civilians.

1577
01:22:53,762 --> 01:22:55,073
Then we'll move directly
on the arsenal.

1578
01:22:55,097 --> 01:22:57,475
- There's something else.
- What?

1579
01:22:57,558 --> 01:22:59,310
I want to settle our account.

1580
01:22:59,393 --> 01:23:00,787
Back in Kansas
you promised to pay me

1581
01:23:00,811 --> 01:23:02,354
what's due
when you got the money.

1582
01:23:02,438 --> 01:23:05,357
How dare you demand a settlement
of a private matter?

1583
01:23:05,441 --> 01:23:07,586
With the nation hour of
deliverance not three days off.

1584
01:23:07,610 --> 01:23:09,862
That's putting the cart
before the horse, isn't it?

1585
01:23:09,945 --> 01:23:11,822
I've done a job for you
nobody else can do.

1586
01:23:11,906 --> 01:23:13,324
So, I was right at Palmyra

1587
01:23:13,407 --> 01:23:14,718
the cause itself
means nothing to you.

1588
01:23:14,742 --> 01:23:16,011
I'm only holding you
to your word.

1589
01:23:16,035 --> 01:23:17,471
Are you, indeed,
have you forgotten so

1590
01:23:17,495 --> 01:23:18,680
quickly my measures with
disloyalty?

1591
01:23:18,704 --> 01:23:20,372
I haven't forgotten anything.

1592
01:23:20,456 --> 01:23:22,350
But you got the money to pay me
and you can't afford not to.

1593
01:23:22,374 --> 01:23:24,418
Then add this to your memory.

1594
01:23:27,755 --> 01:23:29,048
I haven't waited 30 years

1595
01:23:29,131 --> 01:23:31,133
to bargain with a rouge
at the final hour.

1596
01:23:38,516 --> 01:23:41,435
[instrumental music]

1597
01:23:55,866 --> 01:23:58,035
Hiya.

1598
01:23:58,118 --> 01:23:59,954
This is the kind of army life
I like.

1599
01:24:00,037 --> 01:24:02,331
- Do you ever see me waltz?
- I've heard of it.

1600
01:24:02,414 --> 01:24:04,917
But this ain't no Santa Fe
shake down.

1601
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,212
Hold it. You're in high society
now, come on.

1602
01:24:08,295 --> 01:24:10,714
[clears throat]

1603
01:24:10,798 --> 01:24:13,050
May I have your invitations
please, gentlemen?

1604
01:24:13,133 --> 01:24:16,136
- What's them?
- Thems 'em little white cards.

1605
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:19,598
We ain't go no invitations, Joe.
Can't we get in on our uniforms?

1606
01:24:19,682 --> 01:24:23,102
No, sir. Not unless you wants to
go right out on 'em again.

1607
01:24:23,185 --> 01:24:25,229
Oh, we're the fellows
who cleaned up Kansas.

1608
01:24:25,312 --> 01:24:27,231
- Ain't you ever heard of us.
- Sorry, sir.

1609
01:24:27,314 --> 01:24:29,316
But we don't need no cleaning.

1610
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:30,484
Good evening.

1611
01:24:30,568 --> 01:24:33,487
[instrumental music]

1612
01:24:51,839 --> 01:24:53,674
Hello, handsome.

1613
01:24:53,757 --> 01:24:56,343
- Oh, hi, Jeb.
- My! You're a dream tonight.

1614
01:24:56,427 --> 01:24:57,970
- How's the party?
- I don't know.

1615
01:24:58,053 --> 01:24:59,680
She hasn't come out yet.

1616
01:24:59,763 --> 01:25:01,932
- Who you waiting for?
- Old friend of mine.

1617
01:25:02,016 --> 01:25:03,851
Promised me a surprise tonight.

1618
01:25:03,934 --> 01:25:05,936
A night I'd remember
the rest of my life.

1619
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:08,188
Yeah? You don't know any girl
here but Kit, you know?

1620
01:25:08,272 --> 01:25:09,815
I-I'm not talking.

1621
01:25:09,898 --> 01:25:11,710
Maybe you don't rate quite as
high as you think you do.

1622
01:25:11,734 --> 01:25:13,152
Captain Stuart.

1623
01:25:13,235 --> 01:25:14,612
[door opens]

1624
01:25:14,695 --> 01:25:16,113
Hello, Kit.

1625
01:25:16,196 --> 01:25:18,115
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.

1626
01:25:18,198 --> 01:25:20,093
Say, George was just telling me
you've promised him

1627
01:25:20,117 --> 01:25:21,410
the biggest night of his life.

1628
01:25:21,493 --> 01:25:23,495
- Where do I come in?
- You don't.

1629
01:25:23,579 --> 01:25:25,664
- I'm very fond of George.
- Thank you, Kit.

1630
01:25:25,748 --> 01:25:29,043
I haven't told you this, but we
have a deep understanding.

1631
01:25:29,126 --> 01:25:31,629
Wait a minute, Kit.
Are you serious? What is this?

1632
01:25:31,712 --> 01:25:34,506
I'm gonna take care of George
for the rest of his life.

1633
01:25:34,590 --> 01:25:36,258
That is if he's the man
I think he is.

1634
01:25:36,342 --> 01:25:37,885
Oh, Kit, I have my faults.

1635
01:25:37,968 --> 01:25:39,070
But I can be as faithful
and loyal

1636
01:25:39,094 --> 01:25:40,113
as any man that ever lived.

1637
01:25:40,137 --> 01:25:41,388
We'll soon see.

1638
01:25:41,472 --> 01:25:44,266
Now wait here, both of you.

1639
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:46,143
Tough luck, son,
I guess we can't all

1640
01:25:46,226 --> 01:25:48,103
have charm and good looks too.

1641
01:25:48,187 --> 01:25:50,290
Custer, I hope you are joking
or you're not gonna have either.

1642
01:25:50,314 --> 01:25:52,584
Oh, don't take it so hard, I
mean, this is something that...

1643
01:25:52,608 --> 01:25:53,609
Hup.

1644
01:25:53,692 --> 01:25:55,444
[giggling]

1645
01:25:56,570 --> 01:25:57,780
Charlotte, I want you to meet.

1646
01:25:57,863 --> 01:25:59,782
Captain Custer
and Captain Stuart.

1647
01:25:59,865 --> 01:26:02,385
This is Charlotte Davis. We were
schoolmates together in Boston.

1648
01:26:02,409 --> 01:26:04,870
- It's a pleasure, Ms. Davis.
- Charlotte: Thank you, captain.

1649
01:26:04,953 --> 01:26:07,039
Yes, indeed. A great pleasure.

1650
01:26:07,122 --> 01:26:09,249
I've heard so much about you,
Captain Custer.

1651
01:26:09,333 --> 01:26:11,418
- Me?
- Charlotte: Mm-hm.

1652
01:26:11,502 --> 01:26:15,005
Well, I, uh...
Well, that is, uh, I mean...

1653
01:26:15,089 --> 01:26:17,800
George: Well, uh...
well, that is... I...

1654
01:26:17,883 --> 01:26:20,135
- Shall we dance, Jeb?
- Yes, of course.

1655
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:24,264
- Who is she?
- That's the blonde.

1656
01:26:24,348 --> 01:26:27,142
The one that George was promised
by old "sit in the mud."

1657
01:26:27,226 --> 01:26:29,520
Oh! I see.

1658
01:26:29,603 --> 01:26:31,271
[instrumental music]

1659
01:26:31,355 --> 01:26:33,148
Well, she's pretty nice.

1660
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:36,652
Don't you think?

1662
01:26:42,491 --> 01:26:44,660
Company, halt!

1663
01:26:44,743 --> 01:26:47,830
Present arms, prepare to scoop.

[clears throat]

1665
01:26:54,503 --> 01:26:56,755
- Uh, sir.
- Yes, sir.

01:26:56,839 --> 01:26:57,839
[clears throat]

Company, forward march!

01:27:04,638 --> 01:27:06,390
Eyes right!

1670

Right wheel.

1671
01:27:08,684 --> 01:27:10,936
Well, there I was right out
in the middle of Kansas

1672
01:27:11,019 --> 01:27:13,814
facing 500 crazy fanatics
heavily armed.

1673
01:27:13,897 --> 01:27:15,816
And me with only 15 soldiers.

1674
01:27:15,899 --> 01:27:18,318
Good heavens, captain.
How terrifying.

1675
01:27:18,402 --> 01:27:19,570
What did you do?

1676
01:27:19,653 --> 01:27:21,280
I sized up the situation
at a glance

1677
01:27:21,363 --> 01:27:22,924
dismounted and walked
straight toward them.

1678
01:27:22,948 --> 01:27:25,284
Not... not alone.

1679
01:27:25,367 --> 01:27:27,762
My dear, young lady, there comes
a time in every soldier's life

1680
01:27:27,786 --> 01:27:29,705
when he must stand
or fall alone.

1681
01:27:29,788 --> 01:27:31,224
And if you knew the army
you'd understand

1682
01:27:31,248 --> 01:27:33,584
that he who hesitates is lost.

1683
01:27:33,667 --> 01:27:35,919
Well, that was something
wonderful, captain.

1684
01:27:36,003 --> 01:27:37,796
Oh, it was nothing. Really.

1685
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:40,799
[music continues]

1686
01:27:43,093 --> 01:27:45,179
[applauding]

1687
01:27:47,139 --> 01:27:48,807
Will you come and meet
my father, captain?

1688
01:27:48,891 --> 01:27:52,436
Why, I'd be delighted.
Is he in the government service?

1689
01:27:52,519 --> 01:27:54,706
Yes, but I think he'll lose
his job in the next election.

1690
01:27:54,730 --> 01:27:57,149
Oh, that's too bad.
Say, he should be in the army.

1691
01:27:57,232 --> 01:27:58,650
You know,
politics don't bother us.

1692
01:27:58,734 --> 01:28:00,235
He'd rather go fishing anyway.

1693
01:28:00,319 --> 01:28:01,487
- Father.
- Hello, Charlotte.

1694
01:28:01,570 --> 01:28:03,197
- Hello, Colonel Lee.
- My dear.

1695
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:06,200
Father, I'd like you to meet
Captain George Custer.

1696
01:28:06,283 --> 01:28:08,410
Oh, but of course I met
the captain at West Point

1697
01:28:08,494 --> 01:28:10,204
when he graduated, didn't I?

1698
01:28:10,287 --> 01:28:12,164
- Yes, sir.
- How're you, Custer?

1699
01:28:12,247 --> 01:28:13,749
I'm fine, Colonel Lee.

1700
01:28:13,832 --> 01:28:15,810
We've heard good things
about you, congratulations.

1701
01:28:15,834 --> 01:28:17,377
Yes, the captain's just been
telling me

1702
01:28:17,461 --> 01:28:19,755
how he put down the trouble
in Kansas by himself.

1703
01:28:21,965 --> 01:28:24,802
Splendid job at Palmyra.
Splendid.

1704
01:28:24,885 --> 01:28:27,221
Wasn't there also a chap
named Stuart, uh...

1705
01:28:27,304 --> 01:28:29,640
Jeb Stuart connected
with that campaign?

1706
01:28:29,723 --> 01:28:31,683
Stuart?

1707
01:28:31,767 --> 01:28:34,853
Yes, sir. He was around.

1708
01:28:34,937 --> 01:28:36,605
Shall we dance?

1709
01:28:36,688 --> 01:28:39,608
[instrumental music]

Left turn.

1711
01:28:56,291 --> 01:28:58,418
About face.

1712
01:28:58,502 --> 01:28:59,878
March!

1713
01:29:04,967 --> 01:29:07,261
- Jeb.
- Go away.

1714
01:29:07,344 --> 01:29:08,863
You danced with your sister
once already.

1715
01:29:08,887 --> 01:29:10,931
I don't want her,
I want you, come on.

1716
01:29:11,014 --> 01:29:12,283
Hey, you can't leave me
stranded alone

1717
01:29:12,307 --> 01:29:13,387
in the middle of ball room.

1718
01:29:13,433 --> 01:29:15,060
Quiet, spread. Phil, Phil.

1719
01:29:15,143 --> 01:29:17,271
Take over this detail, will you?

1720
01:29:20,107 --> 01:29:21,751
- Are you drunk?
- If I'm not, I ought to be.

1721
01:29:21,775 --> 01:29:23,044
I've just seen enough to knock
anybody down.

1722
01:29:23,068 --> 01:29:24,278
What're you talking about?

1723
01:29:24,361 --> 01:29:25,588
An old friend of yours
is outside.

1724
01:29:25,612 --> 01:29:27,406
And he asked me
to bring you to him.

1725
01:29:27,489 --> 01:29:30,409
[music continues]

1726
01:29:40,127 --> 01:29:42,254
It's real. I almost touched it.

1727
01:29:56,393 --> 01:29:57,978
What're you doing here?

1728
01:29:58,061 --> 01:30:00,522
I came to find you.

1729
01:30:00,606 --> 01:30:03,191
I know what you think of me,
Stuart. That I'm no good.

1730
01:30:04,693 --> 01:30:06,653
Well, maybe you're right.

1731
01:30:06,737 --> 01:30:08,006
Well, maybe I've got something
to tell you

1732
01:30:08,030 --> 01:30:09,364
that'll change your opinion.

1733
01:30:09,448 --> 01:30:11,116
You'll have a hard time
doing that.

1734
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:14,661
Suppose I told you that I left
John Brown three hours ago

1735
01:30:14,745 --> 01:30:16,580
with a well armed force of men

1736
01:30:16,663 --> 01:30:19,625
not very many miles
from where we're standing.

1737
01:30:19,708 --> 01:30:21,293
I'd say
you are out of your mind.

1738
01:30:21,376 --> 01:30:23,170
All set to strike
at Harpers Ferry

1739
01:30:23,253 --> 01:30:26,506
on the Maryland-Virginia line
sometime tonight.

1740
01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:28,884
With the reinforcements
of over 1200 men

1741
01:30:28,967 --> 01:30:31,803
expected before daybreak
from Pennsylvania.

1742
01:30:31,887 --> 01:30:34,765
Brown plans to arouse the slaves

1743
01:30:34,848 --> 01:30:36,576
first in Virginia
and then throughout the south

1744
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:38,268
in open rebellion.

1745
01:30:38,352 --> 01:30:41,188
The telegraph wires will be cut
and he'll block the railroad

1746
01:30:41,271 --> 01:30:43,607
and then at daybreak
they rush the arsenal

1747
01:30:43,690 --> 01:30:45,359
take thousands of weapons
with the idea

1748
01:30:45,442 --> 01:30:47,444
of arming the Negroes.

1749
01:30:47,527 --> 01:30:50,238
Well, that's the situation,
gentlemen. Move for move.

1750
01:30:50,322 --> 01:30:52,216
I don't know, you may be able
to get there ahead of 'em

1751
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:55,410
but if you do,
you've got to move fast tonight.

1752
01:30:55,494 --> 01:30:58,246
It's fantastic,
our Secret Service has reported

1753
01:30:58,330 --> 01:30:59,730
John Brown to be
out of the country.

1754
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:02,334
Well, I oughta know where he is?

1755
01:31:02,417 --> 01:31:04,169
I've been with him
every day and every mile

1756
01:31:04,252 --> 01:31:05,462
since we left Kansas.

1757
01:31:05,545 --> 01:31:08,966
Then why have you informed
on him.

1758
01:31:09,049 --> 01:31:12,344
Don't forget, colonel,
I was in the service once.

1759
01:31:12,427 --> 01:31:13,971
I was young,
and I made a mistake.

1760
01:31:14,054 --> 01:31:17,391
I didn't know that then
but I do now.

1761
01:31:17,474 --> 01:31:19,202
I guess some of the things
we learned at West Point

1762
01:31:19,226 --> 01:31:23,480
stay on inside of us
a lot deeper than we realize.

1763
01:31:23,563 --> 01:31:26,274
Anyway, I couldn't stand by
and see my country torn apart

1764
01:31:26,358 --> 01:31:28,235
by a mad man like Brown.

1765
01:31:28,318 --> 01:31:29,945
I had to come here.

1766
01:31:30,028 --> 01:31:33,031
This was something a lot bigger
than myself.

1767
01:31:33,115 --> 01:31:34,592
Couldn't have been
the size of the reward

1768
01:31:34,616 --> 01:31:36,052
you'll get for turning him in,
could it?

1769
01:31:36,076 --> 01:31:38,787
I said why I came here,
and that's the truth.

1770
01:31:40,205 --> 01:31:42,165
But I am entitled any reward.

1771
01:31:44,042 --> 01:31:46,545
I'm even willing to go back
there and rejoin him tonight

1772
01:31:46,628 --> 01:31:50,632
just in case he gets suspicious
or changes his plans.

1773
01:31:50,716 --> 01:31:53,593
Now what more proof
do you want than that?

1774
01:31:53,677 --> 01:31:56,722
I believe him because
it's too dangerous not to.

1775
01:31:56,805 --> 01:31:58,432
How soon can you start, colonel?

1776
01:31:58,515 --> 01:32:00,600
We'll be ready to leave
in an hour.

1777
01:32:00,684 --> 01:32:02,269
The officers are all here.

1778
01:32:02,352 --> 01:32:03,520
Call them at once and proceed

1779
01:32:03,603 --> 01:32:06,064
with all speed to Harpers Ferry.

1780
01:32:06,148 --> 01:32:09,067
[indistinct chatter]

1781
01:32:14,406 --> 01:32:15,758
You have your orders,
Captain Stuart?

1782
01:32:15,782 --> 01:32:17,117
Yes, sir.

1783
01:32:18,452 --> 01:32:19,745
Jeb, what is it?

1784
01:32:19,828 --> 01:32:21,371
- What's happening?
- John Brown.

1785
01:32:21,455 --> 01:32:22,807
Get the little Davis girl to
take you home.

1786
01:32:22,831 --> 01:32:24,225
- Will you, darling?
- But why, but...

1787
01:32:24,249 --> 01:32:26,043
I'm sorry.
I can't explain now, no time.

1788
01:32:26,126 --> 01:32:27,437
Try to keep the others calm,
tell 'em,

1789
01:32:27,461 --> 01:32:29,629
there's nothing
to be excited about.

1790
01:32:29,713 --> 01:32:31,298
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1791
01:32:36,636 --> 01:32:39,556
[dramatic music]

1792
01:32:52,319 --> 01:32:55,113
Good. There's no more worry
on that score.

1793
01:32:55,197 --> 01:32:57,574
You say no train is due until
well after daybreak.

1794
01:32:57,657 --> 01:32:59,409
No, sir, not until 8 o'clock.

1795
01:32:59,493 --> 01:33:02,412
I rode within ten miles of
Washington to make sure.

1796
01:33:02,496 --> 01:33:03,830
What kept you so long?

1797
01:33:03,914 --> 01:33:05,540
I had to take a side road
both ways.

1798
01:33:05,624 --> 01:33:06,917
[scoffs]

1799
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,335
Shubel, Townsley.

1800
01:33:08,418 --> 01:33:10,629
Get your men
block the railroad bridge.

1801
01:33:10,712 --> 01:33:12,464
We meet below the arsenal
at daybreak.

1802
01:33:12,547 --> 01:33:14,776
Kitzmiller, go to the town with
20 men and get the hostages.

1803
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,194
John: You know the ones?
Kitzmiller: Yes sir.

1804
01:33:16,218 --> 01:33:17,418
John: Rest you men, follow me.

1805
01:33:17,469 --> 01:33:20,388
[dramatic music]

1806
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:48,291
Drop your guns.

1807
01:33:58,343 --> 01:34:00,971
Captain, we got enough guns here
to arm a 1000 men.

1808
01:34:01,054 --> 01:34:02,722
And plenty of powder
and bullets.

1809
01:34:02,806 --> 01:34:04,951
Stack those guns and ammunition
near the door ready to haul.

1810
01:34:04,975 --> 01:34:06,518
Hurry up, boys,
get 'em out there.

1811
01:34:06,601 --> 01:34:08,603
Men from Pennsylvania will
be here within the hour.

1812
01:34:08,687 --> 01:34:10,230
This isn't an arsenal,
it's a fortress.

1813
01:34:10,313 --> 01:34:11,982
We could stand off
the whole army here.

1814
01:34:12,065 --> 01:34:13,567
What about the prisoners,
captain?

1815
01:34:13,650 --> 01:34:15,652
What is the meaning
of this outrage?

1816
01:34:15,735 --> 01:34:18,864
Why have you broken into our
homes and dragged us here?

1817
01:34:18,947 --> 01:34:22,951
- Who are you? John Brown!
- I am John Brown of Kansas.

1818
01:34:23,034 --> 01:34:24,846
You are prisoners
of the provisional government

1819
01:34:24,870 --> 01:34:26,288
of the United States.

1820
01:34:26,371 --> 01:34:28,039
If the citizens of Harpers Ferry

1821
01:34:28,123 --> 01:34:31,835
attempt any interference,
I shall use you as I see fit.

1822
01:34:31,918 --> 01:34:33,437
Otherwise, you will be
peacefully released

1823
01:34:33,461 --> 01:34:36,006
when we depart.

1824
01:34:36,089 --> 01:34:38,169
We must adhere to our schedule
to the precise minute.

1825
01:34:38,216 --> 01:34:40,136
We will leave here
at 10 o'clock and by nightfall

1826
01:34:40,177 --> 01:34:41,720
we should be 35 miles
into Virginia.

1827
01:34:41,803 --> 01:34:43,443
What about the men
from Pennsylvania, sir?

1828
01:34:43,471 --> 01:34:44,907
If they're late in arriving,
we cannot wait.

1829
01:34:44,931 --> 01:34:46,892
Wouldn't that be taking
a long chance?

1830
01:34:46,975 --> 01:34:48,685
No word of us can leak out
until tomorrow

1831
01:34:48,768 --> 01:34:51,730
maybe even two or three days,
and then we'd be 1,500 men.

1832
01:34:51,813 --> 01:34:54,065
I don't see that there's
any reason to hurry.

1833
01:34:54,149 --> 01:34:56,318
- That sound sensible.
- I disagree.

1834
01:34:56,401 --> 01:34:57,753
I'm anxious to get out of here
and time

1835
01:34:57,777 --> 01:34:59,154
is our most valuable weapon.

1836
01:34:59,237 --> 01:35:01,489
Well, you're in command, sir.

1837
01:35:01,573 --> 01:35:03,718
But that's been the fatal
mistake to many an expedition.

1838
01:35:03,742 --> 01:35:05,702
My advice is to wait.

[gunshots]

01:35:24,137 --> 01:35:25,889
Some of the townspeople
are firing at us?

01:35:25,972 --> 01:35:28,183
Just a handful of "em
with old shotguns."

1842
01:35:28,266 --> 01:35:31,228
We can clean them out
in five minutes.

- Brewer.

If you value your life and those
of your fellow townsman

1848
01:35:54,417 --> 01:35:56,169
you will do as I say.

1849
01:35:57,545 --> 01:35:58,922
Yes.

1850
01:36:08,139 --> 01:36:12,936
Stop firing. You're endangering
the your lives of your friends.

John Brown promises that if we
leave the arsenal in his hands

1852
01:36:17,607 --> 01:36:19,609
he will harm none of us.

1853
01:36:19,693 --> 01:36:22,612
No! Run down to us!

we're here on a righteous cause.

Their interests are also ours.
The good of the whole nation.

We'll leave out lesson
at Harpers Ferry

for the rest of the South
to profit by.

Yes or no?

This is Colonel Lee's formal

Once more, sir, you over rate

that I can be taken
against my will.

even the follies
leading to this disaster

has to have hindered
the coming day,

I, John Brown,
am now quite certain

1969
01:47:23,397 --> 01:47:26,692
that the crimes of this guilty
land can never be purged away

but with blood.

1971
01:47:30,196 --> 01:47:33,741
I let them hang me.

1972
01:47:33,824 --> 01:47:35,868
I forgive them
and may God forgive them

1973

of the union.
