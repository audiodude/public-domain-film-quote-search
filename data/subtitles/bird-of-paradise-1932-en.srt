1
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,319
- Five and a half fathoms!
- Five and a half fathoms!

2
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:42,728
Five and a half!

3
00:01:45,156 --> 00:01:47,415
That smooth spot between
the two lines of breakers.

4
00:01:47,425 --> 00:01:48,724
Yeah, I see it.

5
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:51,692
Four and a half, getting shallow fast!

6
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:54,150
Four and a half, getting shallow!

7
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,989
Four and a half. Steady!

8
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,807
George says three fathoms through passage.

9
00:01:58,817 --> 00:02:00,506
Hey, Tinker, ease that mainsheet!

10
00:02:00,516 --> 00:02:03,185
- How many feet in a fathom?
- Six.

11
00:02:04,044 --> 00:02:05,883
Eighteen feet through the passage.

12
00:02:05,983 --> 00:02:07,663
Yeah, and the ship takes fifteen of those.

13
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,200
Oh, three feet to spare.

14
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,669
Well, I forgot to bring my water-wings!

15
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:14,777
Good morning, St. Peter!

16
00:02:15,107 --> 00:02:16,876
Three and a half fathoms!

17
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,594
- Three and a half!
- Draught, Skipper, how old's that chart?

18
00:02:20,604 --> 00:02:23,262
Stand by everybody, we're
going through the passage!

19
00:02:23,272 --> 00:02:25,531
- Mind that jib, Chief!
- Breakers abaft!

20
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:27,725
Catch the swell on the
right so we'll ride it through!

21
00:02:27,735 --> 00:02:29,998
Here they come! Look out, Johnny!

22
00:02:47,617 --> 00:02:49,406
We made it, we're over!

23
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,874
- Great work, Sir!
- I bet we didn't have an inch to spare!

24
00:02:51,884 --> 00:02:52,575
You bet not!

25
00:02:52,585 --> 00:02:54,512
- Take the wheel, will ya?
- Yes, Sir.

26
00:03:05,346 --> 00:03:07,134
Five and a half and getting deeper!

27
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:09,033
Great stuff, Kid, we're in.

28
00:03:09,043 --> 00:03:10,696
- Made it by inches!
- Yep!

29
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:13,330
Yeah! Well after this I'll
do all my yachting ashore!

30
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,329
Aw, you're always crabby, that's a sport.

31
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:18,797
Well, you can have it, I don't want it.

32
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:24,334
Say! You ought to get shock
absorbers on this boat.

33
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:27,652
Sailors, come and get it!

34
00:03:27,662 --> 00:03:28,835
Where have you been?

35
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:34,587
Now, now, now, now!
Women and children first!

36
00:04:04,838 --> 00:04:05,907
Natives!

37
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:09,455
Look at these!

38
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:10,664
Yeah, pretty.

39
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:17,361
Hellooo.

40
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,819
Hellooo.

41
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:21,028
- What's that supposed to be?
- The call of the wild.

42
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:22,997
Hellooo.

43
00:04:27,324 --> 00:04:29,853
- Johnny, you're outta luck, no blondes!
- Yeah, I know.

44
00:04:30,322 --> 00:04:33,110
Oh! You don't suppose
they're cannibals, do you?

45
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,509
Well, if they are, we'll feed 'em you!

46
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,248
Maybe they're not allowed to eat ham.

47
00:04:36,688 --> 00:04:38,517
Don't do that, I'm sensitive!

48
00:04:45,182 --> 00:04:48,301
- What do you call this place?
- Probably one of the Virgin Islands.

49
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:49,880
Heaven forbid!

50
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,509
Here, take this for bait.

51
00:04:51,738 --> 00:04:55,278
Girls, come and get some Chester, pleeeease.

52
00:04:56,975 --> 00:04:59,733
Johnny, here's the charm of the South Seas:

53
00:04:59,773 --> 00:05:03,289
You cruise about and out of nowhere
you tumble onto one of these little islands.

54
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:07,089
And you'll nearly always find the
natives a happy and carefree people.

55
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,099
Yeah, I know

56
00:05:08,298 --> 00:05:10,427
Fond of light wines and dancing.

57
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,421
Hey! Look!

58
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:22,419
Hello, Baby, got anything on for tonight?

59
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:37,480
I give you my heart's blood.

60
00:05:41,347 --> 00:05:42,946
They want to play.

61
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,768
They may never have seen the glass.

62
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:58,643
This water!
Catchee!

63
00:06:13,327 --> 00:06:14,926
My hat!

64
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:28,347
What else you got?

65
00:06:30,716 --> 00:06:33,374
Boy, I never did like a hard clock anyway.

66
00:06:34,075 --> 00:06:35,203
Here!

67
00:06:51,763 --> 00:06:55,530
I've wanted you boys to get rid
of these things for a long time.

68
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,888
Hey, wait a minute!

69
00:06:58,898 --> 00:07:01,726
You can't throw those things overboard!

70
00:07:02,326 --> 00:07:04,395
Oh, they have lots of clothes.

71
00:07:07,723 --> 00:07:09,921
Say, Johnny, see that
little girl over there?

72
00:07:10,451 --> 00:07:12,320
- Here's a present for you.
- Give me that!

73
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,066
- Shark!
- Shark?

74
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:33,145
Shark!!

75
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:37,104
Get the rifle!

76
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,369
Submerged right there!

77
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,787
Hey! Don't shoot him,
you might hit a native!

78
00:07:47,797 --> 00:07:49,597
- Here! Give me a hand with this line!
- Okay.

79
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:23,405
Hey! Don't do that!
You'll tear his leg off.

80
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:37,966
Steady now! Cut him loose, quick!

81
00:08:40,464 --> 00:08:42,933
Do whatever you have
to do, but don't pull it!

82
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,208
What happened?

83
00:09:23,807 --> 00:09:25,105
When the shark took the bait,

84
00:09:25,115 --> 00:09:27,729
your ol' foot got caught up
in the rope and over you went.

85
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:29,619
How did I get out of it?

86
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:32,731
The line parted between you and
the shark, looks like it's been cut.

87
00:09:32,761 --> 00:09:34,600
Probably one of the natives.

88
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,559
Which one?

89
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,009
Go on, Sweetheart, I'm listening.

90
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:20,651
Sardines again.

91
00:11:03,473 --> 00:11:05,451
- Not bad, eh?
- Perfect!

92
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:09,276
- I'm drunk again.
- Oh! I was just tired, I know.

93
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:12,589
Say, he must be the Big Medicine
around here, eh, Skipper?

94
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:15,308
He sure is! That's the guy
that feeds the volcano.

95
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:17,198
- Feeds the volcano?
- Sure!

96
00:11:17,434 --> 00:11:20,259
That's the way they keep the volcano quiet.
He feeds it.

97
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:22,671
- Throws it the fish?
- No, Sir!

98
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:25,809
They must be young and beautiful
to please the volcano.

99
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,316
He wants us to eat.

100
00:11:34,224 --> 00:11:37,724
- I can't make up my mind what I want?
- Got any straws?

101
00:11:43,218 --> 00:11:45,158
What is this, a paper hanger's convention?

102
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:48,643
All kiding aside, Skippy,
what... what is this?

103
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:49,580
It's poi.

104
00:11:49,644 --> 00:11:50,863
- Poi?
- It's a poi.

105
00:11:51,413 --> 00:11:53,960
- Poi or girl, I wouldn't like it.
- You like poi.

106
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:56,187
You remember the poi
your mother used to bake!

107
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,599
Apple poi, lemon poi, rhubarb poi...

108
00:11:58,638 --> 00:12:01,821
Oh! That kine of poi!
Well, here goes!

109
00:12:04,665 --> 00:12:06,708
Aw! That's good!

110
00:12:18,326 --> 00:12:20,077
That's beautiful, Mac!

111
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:36,890
Hello there!

112
00:12:39,781 --> 00:12:41,183
Sure, I'm the guy.

113
00:12:41,684 --> 00:12:42,684
Sure!

114
00:13:02,668 --> 00:13:03,668
Boy, that's good!

115
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:06,662
I've eaten worse than this in the Waldorf.

116
00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:09,252
Hey, Skipper, what is this?

117
00:13:09,494 --> 00:13:10,613
It's octopus.

118
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:11,852
Octopus?

119
00:13:14,391 --> 00:13:17,530
If something crawls and stabs at you tonight,
Hector, it's me!

120
00:13:18,588 --> 00:13:20,949
Ooh! It's got me, I'm an octopus.

121
00:15:28,036 --> 00:15:30,035
Skipper, what are they sore about?

122
00:15:30,205 --> 00:15:33,061
How you can certainly pick 'em,
that's the King's daughter.

123
00:15:33,303 --> 00:15:34,611
Yeah, that's all right with me.

124
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:37,432
Yeah, but it isn't all
right with them, she's taboo.

125
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,933
What do you mean?

126
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:42,252
Well, you see, they have rules
about such things in the Islands.

127
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:45,395
No one's supposed to touch her
except a native prince.

128
00:15:45,495 --> 00:15:46,636
They're very strict about it.

129
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,366
You're going to get
your throat cut, Johnny.

130
00:15:48,731 --> 00:15:52,068
Well, Johnny, it looks to me that the
only out is for you to run for the job

131
00:15:52,148 --> 00:15:55,473
of Native Prince on the
democratic ticket this fall.

132
00:16:19,174 --> 00:16:22,631
It's funny, Mac, what the
tropics'll do to a kid like Johnny.

133
00:16:23,371 --> 00:16:25,091
I wish they did it to me.

134
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,609
You better keep you eye on him, Mac.

135
00:16:27,918 --> 00:16:29,039
He's going native.

136
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:34,788
Ol' Devil Night's got 'im!
Ol' Tom-Tom done stole our Johnny away.

137
00:16:35,122 --> 00:16:38,392
Don't you wish your were young enough
to feel the way that that kid feels.

138
00:16:38,962 --> 00:16:40,197
That's right, Mac

139
00:16:40,356 --> 00:16:42,718
Not me, might keep me awake.

140
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,135
Say, did you see the expression on Johnny's

141
00:16:45,145 --> 00:16:48,444
face when that witch
doctor was doin' all the...?

142
00:16:48,785 --> 00:16:51,615
Say, what made that plant
shrivel up like that, anyhow?

143
00:16:51,754 --> 00:16:53,574
I blew my breath on it.

144
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:30,356
You little devil!

145
00:18:31,391 --> 00:18:32,762
I'll get even with you!

146
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:34,618
You gonna let me see your face?

147
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:10,105
Hey Mac, what's happened to Johnny?

148
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,632
I can't find him...
his bunk hasn't been slept in.

149
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:14,708
Hey, Skipper, is Johnny on board?

150
00:21:14,888 --> 00:21:17,106
- I have't seen him, where is he?
- What's all the ruckus?

151
00:21:17,116 --> 00:21:18,332
Johnny's not on the boat.

152
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,085
What are you grinning about, Mac?

153
00:21:20,384 --> 00:21:23,445
Well, as a matter of fact,
I had a long talk with Johnny last night.

154
00:21:23,652 --> 00:21:25,571
And he's decided to stay on the island

155
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,239
and we'll pick him up on the way back.

156
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,108
- On the Island?
- Yep!

157
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:30,248
Aw, you're kidding, Mac,
Johnny's somewhere on this boat.

158
00:21:30,258 --> 00:21:34,820
No I'm not kidding and, as a matter
of fact, I think it's a swell idea.

159
00:21:35,282 --> 00:21:37,749
I wish I'd done the same
thing when I was a kid.

160
00:21:38,104 --> 00:21:40,824
Why, this is ridiculous! Hey, Skipper,
turn around, we're going back.

161
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:43,468
He'll never get out of there alive,
those people are savages.

162
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,687
- Come on Skipper, let's go back.
- Come on! Turn around!

163
00:21:45,697 --> 00:21:48,703
We're not going back,
we're going on right as we are.

164
00:21:48,736 --> 00:21:51,434
- Mac, are you mad?
- No, I'm not mad.

165
00:21:51,665 --> 00:21:54,083
I think I know Johnny a
little better than you fellows.

166
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:58,093
Matter of fact, I'm for him 100%,
and I told him so last night.

167
00:21:58,451 --> 00:21:59,614
So that's that!

168
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:00,959
Now, don't you boys worry about Johnny,

169
00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:03,720
I packed his duffle bag and
put in everything he'll need.

170
00:22:03,887 --> 00:22:05,655
Let's see... hot water bottle,

171
00:22:05,726 --> 00:22:06,740
bicarbonate of soda,

172
00:22:06,755 --> 00:22:08,661
needle and thread, a box of toothpicks,

173
00:22:08,754 --> 00:22:10,477
tennis racket, golf sticks,

174
00:22:10,553 --> 00:22:13,158
a bottle of ginger ale...
Oh! And a ukulele.

175
00:22:28,461 --> 00:22:30,547
Hey, Brat! What are you doin' here?

176
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,545
You're gonna cut yourself with that!

177
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:34,875
Hey there, Oscar, you have my boy's shirt!

178
00:22:35,366 --> 00:22:37,600
What are you doing? Here, give me that!

179
00:22:38,601 --> 00:22:39,846
You're gonna wreck all that.

180
00:23:01,321 --> 00:23:02,980
Hey! What's going on around here?

181
00:23:08,216 --> 00:23:09,304
What?

182
00:25:23,431 --> 00:25:25,381
Hey, what's the big idea?

183
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:35,319
My, my, my... roses!

184
00:26:36,415 --> 00:26:37,849
Hey, who thought this up?

185
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,370
I don't get you, Sister.

186
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:52,471
Oh, you want me to sit down.

187
00:26:53,204 --> 00:26:55,817
Oh! Well, all right,
I'll try anything once!

188
00:27:13,662 --> 00:27:14,988
I don't get you, Baby.

189
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:19,920
Oh, you want me to struggle with you.

190
00:27:21,027 --> 00:27:22,813
Never on occasions like this!

191
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:27,511
Well, all right, but remember
I'm only pretending!

192
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:35,612
Ene-hu.

193
00:27:38,576 --> 00:27:39,732
Ene-hu again!

194
00:27:41,944 --> 00:27:43,422
Oh! Ene-hu more!

195
00:27:53,066 --> 00:27:54,773
Seems we have company.

196
00:27:57,064 --> 00:27:58,097
Come on baby.

197
00:27:59,203 --> 00:28:00,540
We gotta make a run for it.

198
00:28:54,228 --> 00:28:55,938
A happy carefree peoples...

199
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:58,932
fond of light wines and dancing, huh?

200
00:29:53,331 --> 00:29:54,674
What does it say?

201
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:58,355
You don't tell me.

202
00:30:01,785 --> 00:30:04,614
Well, I'll have to consult my secretary
before I can tell you about that.

203
00:30:04,624 --> 00:30:06,135
Here! Take a letter!

204
00:30:08,781 --> 00:30:10,325
What's that about Luana?

205
00:30:19,074 --> 00:30:20,117
Oh, I see.

206
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,614
Yeah.

207
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:28,885
Oh, I see! Luana!

208
00:30:30,552 --> 00:30:32,562
Oh! That's me! The white stick, huh?

209
00:30:37,633 --> 00:30:38,633
Native.

210
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:43,764
Luana go down to native village, huh?

211
00:30:53,793 --> 00:30:55,787
Marry native prince, kanaka?

212
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:50,088
Hey! Ya can't get down there,
it's too steep!

213
00:34:26,488 --> 00:34:27,488
Luana!

214
00:34:28,187 --> 00:34:29,237
Luana!

215
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:30,986
Luana!

216
00:34:32,015 --> 00:34:34,093
Luana, don't go with them, Luana!

217
00:34:34,154 --> 00:34:36,333
White man want you to
stay here with him always.

218
00:34:36,412 --> 00:34:37,842
Don't you understand, Luana?

219
00:34:37,881 --> 00:34:39,161
I want you to stay here with me.

220
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:30,288
Untie my hands!

221
00:35:30,918 --> 00:35:32,142
Untie the rope!

222
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:07,956
Where I can get a canoe?

223
00:36:08,095 --> 00:36:09,184
I've gotta have a canoe!

224
00:36:09,194 --> 00:36:11,208
A canoe! Don't you understand?

225
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:17,926
Oh, taboo, bunk!
I've got to have a canoe!

226
00:36:18,388 --> 00:36:19,388
A canoe.

227
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:28,003
Here, you get me a canoe I
give you this, it's nice and soft.

228
00:36:28,512 --> 00:36:30,430
Here, I give you this... light.

229
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,110
Do you smoke?

230
00:37:06,118 --> 00:37:08,002
Oh, it doesn't hurt you. Here!

231
00:37:08,257 --> 00:37:10,734
Here! You can have it!
I give it to you!

232
00:37:11,115 --> 00:37:12,115
You take it!

233
00:37:12,454 --> 00:37:13,454
Now get me canoe!

234
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:15,451
Canoe, see? Canoe!

235
00:37:15,682 --> 00:37:18,202
I'll take it away from you unless
you get me a canoe right away!

236
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,743
Do I get a canoe?

237
00:37:20,149 --> 00:37:21,206
All right. Here!

238
00:37:40,337 --> 00:37:41,500
Paint job, huh?

239
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:42,715
Great idea!

240
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:47,698
Here, put some on my back!

241
00:43:05,231 --> 00:43:06,231
Look!

242
00:43:22,551 --> 00:43:23,551
What?

243
00:43:27,218 --> 00:43:31,047
Oh, I see what you mean:
OUR HOME.

244
00:43:32,175 --> 00:43:34,237
OUR HOME?

245
00:43:34,573 --> 00:43:36,563
Our home

246
00:43:37,403 --> 00:43:39,670
Our home.

247
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,294
That's swell!

248
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:07,353
What?

249
00:44:09,351 --> 00:44:10,524
Oh! Water!

250
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:12,255
WAH-TU?

251
00:44:12,265 --> 00:44:13,832
Wa-ter.

252
00:44:14,253 --> 00:44:17,085
- WA-TER!!!
- You're a cinch!

253
00:44:43,699 --> 00:44:44,699
<i>Food, huh?</i>

254
00:44:45,768 --> 00:44:46,517
FUDAH?

255
00:44:46,527 --> 00:44:48,985
No, not FUDHUNH... FOOD!

256
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:50,653
FOOD!

257
00:44:50,795 --> 00:44:51,883
Practically perfect!

258
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,153
<i>Oh! I see! Coconuts.</i>

259
00:45:01,918 --> 00:45:03,512
Oh, I'm afraid I get you, Sweetheart.

260
00:45:20,646 --> 00:45:21,735
Do you wanna help me up?

261
00:45:24,074 --> 00:45:25,387
Well, here it goes!

262
00:45:53,525 --> 00:45:54,960
Oh, boy!

263
00:46:11,674 --> 00:46:14,366
Here comes a big one!
Heads up!

264
00:46:15,441 --> 00:46:16,691
Did it get wet?

265
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:19,385
Here comes another one!

266
00:46:20,368 --> 00:46:21,474
Watch out!

267
00:46:22,607 --> 00:46:23,830
Like it?

268
00:46:28,633 --> 00:46:32,046
Right over home base! It's a
great pitch! And he's out!

269
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:10,577
What?

270
00:47:10,777 --> 00:47:11,841
Lovely!

271
00:47:12,475 --> 00:47:13,475
Oh! Knife!

272
00:47:13,933 --> 00:47:14,933
Knife, huh?

273
00:47:15,073 --> 00:47:16,073
Knife!

274
00:47:16,774 --> 00:47:18,874
Knife. -Knife. -Knife. -Knife.

275
00:47:19,101 --> 00:47:21,281
I'm glad you know how
to do all of these things.

276
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:22,841
I'd be lost out here!

277
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:31,764
Spilled a little.

278
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:39,781
You spill it!

279
00:47:43,116 --> 00:47:44,351
You're filling me.

280
00:47:55,609 --> 00:47:56,609
You take a little now!

281
00:47:56,678 --> 00:47:57,910
See how you like it.

282
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:02,584
Um! That's marvelous!

283
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:22,332
Kiss me!

284
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:26,627
Suppose I make you kiss me?

285
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:35,518
I'll teach you to run away from me!

286
00:48:39,381 --> 00:48:40,381
Rain!

287
00:48:46,546 --> 00:48:48,590
Say! I fell like a potato bug!

288
00:48:49,045 --> 00:48:51,123
We can't run under these
leaves every time it rains.

289
00:48:51,543 --> 00:48:53,161
I've go to build a house.

290
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:55,441
House?

291
00:48:55,541 --> 00:49:00,092
Yeah! A place to live in.
A shelter. You know, a place to sleep.

292
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,938
Oh, yeah! Well, that, too!

293
00:51:44,764 --> 00:51:46,535
Let it rain, let it pour!

294
00:51:52,045 --> 00:51:53,349
Well, do you like it?

295
00:51:55,526 --> 00:51:57,573
Oh! Johnny!

296
00:51:58,625 --> 00:52:00,059
Finish house, huh?

297
00:52:00,324 --> 00:52:02,542
It's a palace, it's a castle.

298
00:52:07,689 --> 00:52:10,985
Look, Whiskers, now you
have place for sleep!

299
00:52:11,047 --> 00:52:14,734
Hey, Nick! I didn't build that house
for the goat, I built for you and me.

300
00:52:16,108 --> 00:52:17,466
You do everything.

301
00:52:17,513 --> 00:52:19,307
Yeah, I'm a great guy all right.

302
00:52:24,379 --> 00:52:25,699
You happy?

303
00:52:29,835 --> 00:52:32,948
And when the gang comes back,
I'm gonna take you home with me.

304
00:52:34,572 --> 00:52:35,665
No, Johnny.

305
00:52:36,501 --> 00:52:37,501
No!

306
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,598
Oh, why not?

307
00:52:41,198 --> 00:52:43,821
Some day, Pele angry.

308
00:52:44,396 --> 00:52:45,687
Tom-toms call,

309
00:52:46,325 --> 00:52:47,437
I go.

310
00:52:48,993 --> 00:52:50,339
You mean to the volcano?

311
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:53,457
I won't let you go.

312
00:52:53,517 --> 00:52:55,220
You belong to me now, see?

313
00:52:56,658 --> 00:53:00,938
If I not here here when
Pele calls, then Pele angry.

314
00:53:01,355 --> 00:53:02,375
You too!

315
00:53:02,584 --> 00:53:04,245
Volcano curse on you.

316
00:53:04,953 --> 00:53:08,146
- You die, too.
- Aw! Now, thats a lot of hooey!

317
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:11,468
I'm not afraid of Pele and what
the volcano curse can do to me.

318
00:53:11,849 --> 00:53:13,582
And you're not gonna be afraid either.

319
00:53:14,007 --> 00:53:15,880
I'm gonna take you back to civilization.

320
00:53:16,476 --> 00:53:19,164
We don't have any crazy,
superstitious ideas about

321
00:53:19,174 --> 00:53:22,099
volcanoes being mad at people
and putting a curse on 'em.

322
00:53:22,672 --> 00:53:26,028
Civilization?
Where is that?

323
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,422
Well, it's... that's not a place.
That's where things are happening,

324
00:53:29,844 --> 00:53:31,469
people are accomplishing something.

325
00:53:31,696 --> 00:53:33,408
Did I tell you about the radio?

326
00:53:33,665 --> 00:53:35,745
Well, all you do is sit there
and turn a little dial,

327
00:53:35,794 --> 00:53:39,297
and all of a sudden, out of the air
comes sound. Right where you are.

328
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:43,385
Isn't that swell?

329
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:46,800
Now, look, it's getting dark.

330
00:53:47,026 --> 00:53:49,245
Now, if we were in San Francisco, bingo!

331
00:53:49,355 --> 00:53:51,303
I'd press a button..lights!

332
00:53:54,352 --> 00:53:58,007
Oh, Johnny, but it is so nice in the dark.

333
00:53:59,718 --> 00:54:02,583
Say, Luana, you certainly
make civilization look silly.

334
00:54:02,776 --> 00:54:04,313
But it's not, really!
It's great!

335
00:54:04,845 --> 00:54:06,117
Gee, wait 'til you see it!

336
00:54:06,414 --> 00:54:08,714
Market Street with all
its traffic and lights.

337
00:54:08,773 --> 00:54:12,885
People going to theaters. Hotels
with grand, tiled bathrooms...

338
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:15,022
Hot water running into steaming tubs.

339
00:54:15,844 --> 00:54:17,962
Restaurants where they serve grand food.

340
00:54:18,662 --> 00:54:20,965
Parties, football games, dances.

341
00:54:21,065 --> 00:54:23,894
Speed boats, airplanes
roaring through the air.

342
00:54:23,933 --> 00:54:25,610
Gee, Luana, civilization's...

343
00:54:41,652 --> 00:54:43,756
You're a sweet kid.

344
00:56:26,256 --> 00:56:28,652
Pele, Pele!

345
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:51,940
Johnny

346
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:53,639
Johnny!

347
00:56:54,506 --> 00:56:55,506
Oh, Johnny!

348
00:56:55,939 --> 00:56:56,939
Johnny!

349
00:56:57,362 --> 00:56:58,362
Johnny!

350
00:56:59,819 --> 00:57:00,819
Johnny!

351
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:01,875
Johnny!

352
00:57:03,276 --> 00:57:04,276
<i>Johnny!</i>

353
00:57:06,064 --> 00:57:07,064
Johnny!

354
00:59:45,401 --> 00:59:46,401
Luana!

355
00:59:47,357 --> 00:59:48,357
Luana!

356
00:59:51,426 --> 00:59:52,426
Luana!

357
00:59:52,982 --> 00:59:53,982
Luana!

358
01:00:37,052 --> 01:00:39,204
Luana! Luana!

359
01:06:49,893 --> 01:06:51,134
Johnny.

360
01:06:53,831 --> 01:06:55,021
Luana.

361
01:06:55,559 --> 01:06:56,559
Johnny!

362
01:06:56,829 --> 01:06:57,932
Luana!

363
01:07:01,156 --> 01:07:02,672
What are they gonna do to you?!?

364
01:07:04,584 --> 01:07:06,114
What are they gonna do to you?!?!?

365
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:09,944
I make big sin, Johnny.

366
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,694
They give me to Pele.

367
01:07:12,718 --> 01:07:14,275
Aw, you haven't sinned.

368
01:07:14,777 --> 01:07:17,458
I loved you and you loved me,
that's all there is to it!

369
01:07:18,245 --> 01:07:20,052
But I taboo for white man, Johnny.

370
01:07:20,144 --> 01:07:21,431
That's not true!

371
01:07:22,672 --> 01:07:24,440
Oh, I caused all this.

372
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:27,117
I am happy, Johnny.

373
01:07:27,539 --> 01:07:30,710
I happy you steal me away
and we live together.

374
01:07:31,137 --> 01:07:33,179
I happy you teach me kiss.

375
01:07:33,606 --> 01:07:35,349
I happy you hold me.

376
01:07:35,464 --> 01:07:37,004
I happy for everything!

377
01:07:38,269 --> 01:07:42,060
It was best thing that ever come to me.

378
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,274
I thought I just had a yen for ya.

379
01:07:44,528 --> 01:07:46,428
I thought this was only gonna be a lark!

380
01:07:47,038 --> 01:07:48,388
Oh, but I love you, Luana.

381
01:07:49,026 --> 01:07:50,746
I love you more than
I've ever loved anyone.

382
01:07:50,954 --> 01:07:52,593
More than I COULD love anyone!

383
01:07:53,623 --> 01:07:57,296
Thank you very much... Johnny.

384
01:08:09,583 --> 01:08:10,583
What do you want?

385
01:08:11,042 --> 01:08:12,578
Do you understand? What do you want?

386
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:15,630
Let her go! Let her go!
I'll give you anything you want.

387
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:17,128
Ships, knives, canoes, anything.

388
01:08:17,138 --> 01:08:19,676
Only, but let her go, please, please!

389
01:08:32,668 --> 01:08:33,947
Oh, Johnny.

390
01:08:36,666 --> 01:08:37,666
What is it?

391
01:08:37,695 --> 01:08:38,823
Whatsa matter, Luana?

392
01:08:39,394 --> 01:08:40,394
What did he say?

393
01:08:41,663 --> 01:08:45,516
Prince say now you come for me,

394
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:47,379
Pele angry.

395
01:08:48,089 --> 01:08:49,624
Volcano curse on you!

396
01:08:50,987 --> 01:08:55,414
Prince say you die... too.

397
01:08:56,983 --> 01:08:59,418
Well, that's all right.

398
01:09:00,251 --> 01:09:01,523
That's sort of as it should be.

399
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:03,309
No, that's wrong!

400
01:09:03,749 --> 01:09:07,936
I sin, Pele God He angry at me.

401
01:09:07,946 --> 01:09:09,587
No, Pele is no God, Luana.

402
01:09:10,005 --> 01:09:11,260
He's only a hole in the ground.

403
01:09:11,944 --> 01:09:13,405
There's only one God, Luana.

404
01:09:14,302 --> 01:09:15,627
Oh, God, help us.

405
01:09:16,441 --> 01:09:17,441
Get her out of this.

406
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,948
It's Pele.

407
01:09:22,197 --> 01:09:24,933
"Our Father which art in heaven,"

408
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:27,594
"Hallowed be thy name."

409
01:09:28,094 --> 01:09:29,616
"Thy kingdom come,"

410
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:34,478
"Thy will be done, on
earth as it is in heaven."

411
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:06,626
They're coming for us!

412
01:10:07,239 --> 01:10:08,905
I've got to kiss you, Luana!

413
01:10:10,507 --> 01:10:12,489
Try! See if you can reach me!

414
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:01,040
Let her alone!

415
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:04,392
Oh, do what you want to me!
Let her alone!

416
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:56,917
Don't shoot anymore, Skipper

417
01:11:57,869 --> 01:11:59,098
Wait and see what happens.

418
01:12:00,138 --> 01:12:01,197
Quiet!

419
01:13:04,697 --> 01:13:06,696
Yeah, that'll fix ya up, young fella.

420
01:13:07,055 --> 01:13:08,331
And don't you move that arm!

421
01:13:08,994 --> 01:13:10,539
That's a bad hole they put in you.

422
01:13:12,292 --> 01:13:13,438
Why, hello, Luana.

423
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:17,534
Johnny... die?

424
01:13:17,569 --> 01:13:19,387
No, no, no!

425
01:13:19,417 --> 01:13:21,112
There is nothing to worry about.

426
01:13:21,546 --> 01:13:23,998
In a day or two he'll
be just as good as new.

427
01:13:30,011 --> 01:13:31,997
No savvy, huh?

428
01:13:32,232 --> 01:13:35,984
Johnny... well... one... two... day.

429
01:13:37,136 --> 01:13:38,136
Understand?

430
01:13:44,386 --> 01:13:45,886
Come here, come here!

431
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:49,613
Come on now, there's
nothing to be afraid of.

432
01:13:50,098 --> 01:13:52,826
Come on, you come up on deck with me.

433
01:13:53,766 --> 01:13:56,191
Johnny... all right!
You come on now!

434
01:13:57,593 --> 01:13:58,693
No.

435
01:14:24,876 --> 01:14:26,053
How is he, Mac?

436
01:14:26,569 --> 01:14:29,621
He's still feverish,
but he'll put out all right.

437
01:14:32,961 --> 01:14:34,497
Well, Fellas, what's the verdict?

438
01:14:34,507 --> 01:14:36,773
Does she go with us or does she stay here?

439
01:14:37,168 --> 01:14:40,956
I still contend that she
won't stand transplanting.

440
01:14:41,336 --> 01:14:43,982
You know, you take a girl

441
01:14:43,992 --> 01:14:46,302
that's been filled with
superstition all her life,

442
01:14:46,563 --> 01:14:49,352
you can't suddenly adapt her to our ways.

443
01:14:49,431 --> 01:14:52,035
Aw, for heaven's sake, you
talk like some old Aunt Emma!

444
01:14:52,129 --> 01:14:53,948
This is 1932!

445
01:14:53,958 --> 01:14:56,941
She's a swell girl and I like her!
That Kipling stuff is a lot of hooey!

446
01:14:57,056 --> 01:14:58,506
You're wrong, Chester.

447
01:14:58,725 --> 01:15:01,161
That boy's whole life
is wrapped up in his family.

448
01:15:01,853 --> 01:15:05,525
Why, if he came home with a native wife,
it'd break his mother's heart!

449
01:15:06,465 --> 01:15:09,738
"For East is East, and West is West,"

450
01:15:12,146 --> 01:15:14,285
"and never the twain shall meet."

451
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:18,326
Mac, what's the dope
on the North and South?

452
01:15:18,824 --> 01:15:20,240
Aw, shut up!

453
01:15:24,039 --> 01:15:25,039
Oh, Johnny.

454
01:15:25,768 --> 01:15:27,115
Pele not like you.

455
01:15:27,137 --> 01:15:29,395
You take me away from him.

456
01:15:29,405 --> 01:15:30,405
He mad.

457
01:15:31,004 --> 01:15:32,423
He want you die too.

458
01:15:34,332 --> 01:15:36,001
But I not let you.

459
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:40,943
I go to Pele.

460
01:15:41,828 --> 01:15:45,908
He forgive... everything
work right for you.

461
01:15:47,754 --> 01:15:48,823
Luana...

462
01:15:49,723 --> 01:15:51,525
- No.
- Yes, Johnny.

463
01:15:51,821 --> 01:15:53,200
- Water.
- Water.

464
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,149
Water.

465
01:15:57,918 --> 01:15:59,247
...a drink.

466
01:16:03,514 --> 01:16:04,514
Water.

467
01:16:45,218 --> 01:16:46,956
What do you want?

468
01:16:54,312 --> 01:16:56,135
- What do you want?
- Something about Luana.

469
01:16:56,211 --> 01:16:58,278
Hey, Skipper, find out what he wants!

470
01:16:58,313 --> 01:16:59,930
Yes, Sir.

471
01:17:10,272 --> 01:17:12,889
It's the old chief, the girl's
father, he's come for her.

472
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:15,810
Well, you tell him he can't have her,
that we're taking he back with us.

473
01:17:23,364 --> 01:17:26,336
He says that the volcano
curse has been put on Johnny,

474
01:17:26,662 --> 01:17:29,642
and unless the girl returns
with them, Johnny will die, too.

475
01:17:52,076 --> 01:17:53,303
My father right!

476
01:17:53,974 --> 01:17:55,490
I go... please.

477
01:17:55,543 --> 01:17:57,878
No, Luana, we're going to take you with us.

478
01:17:58,641 --> 01:18:01,410
No, I go go back to my people.

479
01:18:09,105 --> 01:18:11,498
I say goodbye to Johnny.

480
01:20:14,825 --> 01:20:16,116
No, Luana...

481
01:20:16,225 --> 01:20:18,463
We take you with us.

482
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:53,079
Mac, if I had that much courage, I'd...

483
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:59,214
Hey, Skipper, let's get outta here.
This place is getting my goat!
