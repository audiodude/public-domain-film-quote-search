1
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,070
- Can I help you?
- I'd like to see the man in charge.

2
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,000
In here.

3
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,970
- I want to report a murder.
- Sit down.

4
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,440
- Where was this murder committed?
- San Francisco, last night.

5
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,060
Who was murdered?

6
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,650
I was.

7
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,020
Do you want to hear me out or don't you, Captain?
I don't have very much time.

8
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,370
Your name Bigelow, Frank Bigelow?

9
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,540
That's right.

10
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,840
Answer this San Francisco APB,
send it direct to inspector Banner at Homicide,

11
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,580
tell him we've found Frank Bigelow.

12
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,030
Go ahead, Mr. Bigelow.

13
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,570
This involves some other people, Captain,

14
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,050
- a number of other people.
- You tell it any way you like.

15
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,490
I live in a little town called Banning,
out on the desert,

16
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,030
it's on the way to Palm Springs.

17
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,200
I have a small business there...

18
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,870
Paula!

19
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,460
- Yes, Mr. Bigelow?
- Get me a copy of Miss Hollis' '48 tax return, will you?

20
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,170
Oh, you better get the '47 too.

21
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,050
- Yes, Mr. Bigelow.
- I don't think we took any depreciation

22
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,550
on that new equipment last year.
- No, we didn't.

23
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,720
I remember you said we could include it all this year.

24
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,970
- Sure we can.
- Hey Frank. - Yeah, Will?

25
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,890
Peterson says he wants a financial
statement before he can give me my loan.

26
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,150
- Hello, Kitty.
- Hi, Will.

27
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:59,030
Well, I'm leaving for San Francisco today, but I'll be back
in about a week and I'll take care of it for you then.

28
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,780
- Sure is a scorcher, isn't it.
- Well, I've seen 'em worse.

29
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,320
- Well, have a nice time Frank.
- Yeah, thanks Will.

30
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,740
Paula, why don't you come down to the place
and let me give you another permanent?

31
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,660
Makes your hair so much easier
to manage in all this heat.

32
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,750
I can't afford it right now,
maybe next month.

33
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah, here it is. No, we didn't take it.
Well, we can do it this year.

34
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,040
You work it out any way
you think best.

35
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,260
- Have a nice trip, Frank.
- Sure Kitty, see you when I get back.

36
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,880
Bon voyage!

37
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,720
Why don't you come down anyway, Paula?

38
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,510
We'll, uh, work out a deal
on that permanent.

39
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,770
Thanks, maybe I will.

40
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,150
Hello?
Oh hello Mr. Hawkins, just a moment.

41
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,110
You want him to send your ticket over?

42
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,110
- No, I'll pick it up myself.
- No, Mr. Bigelow will get it at the station.

43
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,410
Bye.

44
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,500
I want to go with you, Frank.

45
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,390
Now Paula, I'm just going on
a little vacation, you know that.

46
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,320
- You want to go without me don't you?
- Be gone just a week.

47
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,700
And I suppose you just made up your mind to take

48
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,370
- this vacation at nine o'clock this morning?
- No, Paula, I meant to tell you

49
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,720
- about it a few days ago, I guess I forgot.
- Oh, you forgot!

50
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,550
- Paula, don't be like that.
- Don't be like what?

51
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,970
You just drop a little anouncement
that you're going away

52
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,060
not tomorrow, or next week,

53
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,690
or next month, but today.
No explanations, nothing.

54
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,980
And I'm supposed to swallow the
excuse that you need a little vacation.

55
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,230
I just want to get away from
town for a few days, that's all.

56
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,630
Get away from this town,
or get away from me?

57
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,770
- Oh, Paula, please try to understand.
- How can you ask me to understand anything like this?

58
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,050
No, I'm sorry, but I don't understand.

59
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,250
Go to San Francisco, but don't expect me
to be waiting for you when you get back!

60
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,560
Paula. Please, Paula.

61
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,230
Come on, turn around. Look at me.

62
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,950
Come here.

63
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,370
Why do you do this to me, Frank?

64
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,870
Why can't you be honest with me?
As honest as I am with you?

65
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,420
- Do you have to go?
- I have to go, Paula. I know what I'm doing.

66
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,710
All right, go! Go anywhere you like.
You can go to blazes for all I care!

67
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,040
Paula!

68
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,170
Paula.

69
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,840
Yes, I know, I'm...

70
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,930
- I'm being foolish.
- Come here.

71
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,730
Come on. Fix you face. We'll go down to
Eddie's and have a drink.

72
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,530
Alright, why not.

73
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,240
- Hiya, Boss
- Hi, Eddie.

74
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,960
- Give us a couple of cold beers, will you?
- Coming up.

75
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,760
Oh, what a relief! This air
conditioning feels good.

76
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,720
I sure wish we had it in the office,
it would make working a pleasure.

77
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,340
If it stays this hot, don't bother
going in for the rest of the week.

78
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,100
- I won on two races today.
- How many did you lose?

79
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,180
And you would have to ask that!

80
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,890
- Kind of early for you two, ain't it?
- It's too hot to work!

81
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,770
That's what I like to hear!

82
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,370
Frank...

83
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,250
You'll take me with you, won't you?

84
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,920
You will, won't you?

85
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,300
Or am I crowding you?

86
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,220
What do you mean, crowding me?

87
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,390
Maybe you do need this
week away alone.

88
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,060
Maybe we both do.

89
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,140
I know what's going on
inside of you, Frank.

90
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,940
You're just like any other man,
only a little more so.

91
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,050
You have a feeling of being trapped, hemmed in,
and you don't know whether or not you like it.

92
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,900
Look, Paula,
I'm going to be honest with you.

93
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,530
I care too much for you
not to be honest with you.

94
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,370
I'm as much concerned for your
happiness as I am for my own.

95
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,000
I know you've had one bad experience,
Frank, I know all about it.

96
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,330
But you don't know what it can
do to two people, Paula.

97
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,290
And the woman always gets hurt
more than the man.

98
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,130
I don't want you to get hurt, darling.

99
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,880
More than anything in the world,
I don't want you to get hurt.

100
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:42,020
- Want to hear some music?
- Alright, Frank.

101
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,900
- Got a couple of nickels, Eddie?
- Yep.

102
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,690
- This won't bother you, will it?
- No, next result doesn't come in for half an hour.

103
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,370
I thought that by now
we'd be married.

104
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,500
No, I'm not going to crowd you
any more, Frank.

105
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,500
Go to San Francisco. I don't like it,

106
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,510
but I'm convinced that you must go.

107
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,010
I want you to be very sure, Frank.

108
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,470
If it's right, and I believe it is,

109
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,270
we'll have something really
wonderful together.

110
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,810
If it isn't, we should both
know it as soon as possible.

111
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,690
So you see, even if I could stop you,
I wouldn't do it now.

112
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,850
- Yes Sir.
- My name's Bigelow, I have a reservation.

113
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,310
Yes Sir.

114
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,810
- Here we are, Sir.
- My name's Bigelow, I have a reservation.

115
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,200
I have it sir. It's a very nice room on
the sixth floor,

116
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,320
facing the Bay. Boy!

117
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,550
This might help you enjoy
your stay, Mr. Bigelow.

118
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,560
It's a little booklet on how
to have... "fun" in San Francisco.

119
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,560
- Oh, thank you!.
- You're very welcome Sir.

120
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,400
- Say is it always like this around here?
- No, this is market week, the last day.

121
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,540
Boy!

122
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,160
Always around until you need them.

123
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,950
Here's a message for you,
Mr. Bigelow.

124
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,620
Long distance call came in about
an hour ago, from Banning,

125
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,770
- from a Paula Gibson.
- Oh, thank you. - You're very welcome.

126
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,140
- Show Mr. Bigelow to 618.
- Right this way, Sir.

127
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,910
Right this way, Mr. Bigelow.

128
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,400
- Is there anything else, Mr. Bigelow?
- Oh, yes.

129
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,350
You can get me a dry Manhattan,
and a packet of razor blades.

130
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,710
- Yes, Sir.
- Thank you.

131
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,970
Oh, and you can leave that door open.

132
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,830
Hello operator, I want to speak to
Miss Paula Gibson

133
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,760
in Banning, California.
Yeah, that's right... No, I'll wait.

134
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,780
- Hello?
- Hello, Paula.

135
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,390
- Oh, hello Frank. How is the trip?
- Fine, just fine.

136
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,810
- Having a miserable time, I hope.
- Well I don't know,

137
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,100
I just got in.

138
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:05,100
- What was that?
- Ah... Market week. The place is crawling with travelling salesmen.

139
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,300
You know, Charlie Anderson found out
that you went away

140
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,520
- and he asked me to go out with him.
- Oh really? How did he make out?

141
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,980
- I'm considering it.
- Is that what you called to tell me?

142
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,630
I'll have you know that this call
is strictly business, Mr. Bigelow.

143
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,890
Did a Mr. Phillips phone you,
a Eugene Phillips, of Los Angeles?

144
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,780
- No.
- He will, he phoned the office three times today.

145
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,950
Said that he wanted to get in touch
with you immediately.

146
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,910
He said it's most urgent and
imperative that he reach you at once.

147
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,990
- What did he want?
- I don't know.

148
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,170
But he sounded deep dark and mysterious,
and quite agitated about something.

149
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,000
Phillips, Phillips. Have we... have we
ever done any business with him?

150
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,420
Not unless you've been keeping
it a secret from me.

151
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,920
I looked through all the accounts.

152
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:49,050
Why did you tell him he could reach me here?
You know I'm supposed to be on vacation.

153
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,060
So you told me, and so I told
him, dear heart.

154
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,840
But the gentleman didn't seem to respect
your temperamental moods the way I do.

155
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,750
He was very insistent that he speak to
you "before it's too late", as he put it.

156
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,230
Well tell him you tried to get in touch with me,
and I changed my plans and you can't reach me.

157
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,520
He won't talk to me, I told him
I was your confidential secretary,

158
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,800
but I guess I don't sound
confidential enough.

159
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,030
So I told him that he could reach
you there this evening.

160
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,540
Well call him back. If it's as important
as he says it is, he'll talk to you..

161
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,760
otherwise he'll just have to wait
until I get home.

162
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,500
My, aren't we adamant this evening!

163
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,910
All right, shall do.

164
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,180
- And Frank..
- Yeah?

165
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,720
I.. I don't quite know how to say this...

166
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,340
Say what?

167
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,770
But what I want to say is that there's nothing you can do
that you ever have to feel guilty about.

168
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,160
Oh... Sure.

169
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,410
Thanks, Paula.

170
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,120
I'll... I'll call you tomorrow.

171
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,080
Right.

172
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,100
Oh... Just put it there, please.

173
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,110
- You can keep the change.
- Thanks very much.

174
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:29,200
- Say, how long has this been going on?
- Oh, it's been a madhouse all week.

175
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,410
But they check out tomorrow.
I thought you were with them.

176
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,620
No, I'm just here on a vacation.

177
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,210
Why does everybody come to San Francisco
and tear loose?

178
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,670
Excuse me.

179
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,590
Say, I'm awfully sorry to bother you,
but would you mind if I use your telephone?

180
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,800
- No. No, go right ahead.
- I'm just across the hall here.

181
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,300
One of the boys is using my phone,
and he's been on it for half an hour!

182
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:55,100
I just want to call downstairs.
- Yeah. - Thank you.

183
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,180
Room service, please.

184
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,390
Yeah, things really picked up
the last few days, didn't they.

185
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,560
- You done much business?
- I'm not here on business.

186
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:05,940
Hello, room service?
It's Mr.Haskell, in 617.

187
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,740
Would you send up three more
bottles of Bourbon

188
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,650
and two Scotch.

189
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,660
Yes, oh, and some more ice too.

190
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,750
Thank you. You here all alone?

191
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,330
- Yes, I just got into town.
- Well, why don't you join us for a drink?

192
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:23,830
- Well, I don't want to barge in on your party.
- Oh, nonsense. It's not a party.

193
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,150
It's just a few of the boys entertaining
some buyers. You know,

194
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,460
the usual thing, a few drinks,
and some laughs!

195
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,050
It's no party. Come on! - Well...
- Come on. Come on. - All right.

196
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,350
I know what it's like to be
all alone in a strange city.

197
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,430
- I'm Sam Haskell.
- I'm Frank...

198
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,060
Frank Bigelow.

199
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,190
You'd think some of these guys have
never been away from home before!

200
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,810
Yeah!

201
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,240
Hey, quiet down a bit,
will you quiet down a second.

202
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,020
- I want you to meet Frank Bigelow.
- Hello!

203
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,950
- This is Jane Carlyle. - Hello. - Bill Welch.
- How are ya, Mr. Welch? - Glad to know you, Bigelow.

204
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,510
Jane is the prettiest buyer in San Francisco.

205
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,250
- Hey, I resent that.
- You don't think I believe him, Elaine?

206
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,180
Why, he's spread that from coast to coast.

207
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,280
- It's good for my morale, anyway.
- I'm George Cantwell,

208
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,860
- glad to know you, Mr...
- Bigelow.

209
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,860
- Done much business?
- He's not here on business.

210
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,390
- Oh? Well!
- Why don't you get the man a drink...

211
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,400
- ...before he dies of thirst?
- How about a little Bourbon?

212
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,220
- Oh, that's fine.
- Bourbon it is.

213
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,190
Of course Mr. Wallace.
In fact, yes, Mr. Wallace.

214
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,310
But Mr. Wallace, I'll need at least a week
in Cleveland to visit all my accounts.

215
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,820
I can't think about being in
Philadelphia until the 17th.

216
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,320
Eddie, will you get off the phone?
I want you to meet Frank Bigelow.

217
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,820
- How are you?
- That's his boss. He's been trying for an

218
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:38,160
- hour to get his expense account boosted.
- Yes, the way this guy holds onto a dollar

219
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,610
you'd think they weren't printing them anymore.

220
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,680
Yes, Mr. Wallace! I'm leaving here
the first thing in the morning.

221
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,800
Yes, Sir.

222
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,710
Oh, keep your hips loose, Harry, like this.

223
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,380
Oh, yes!

224
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,120
How's he doing?

225
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,010
Oh, there's nothing wrong with Harry that
two years in a dance school wouldn't cure.

226
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,050
I was doing all right.

227
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,760
This is Sue and Harry Brandon.

228
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,720
- Hello. - Hello, good to meet you.
- How are you.

229
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,850
Where'd you find her, Sam?
On a dance marathon? - Bourbon!

230
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,010
- Say I bet you could do the Rumba?
- Well, a little, but I'm kinda rusty.

231
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,530
Anything would be an improvement
after Harry!

232
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,030
- Well how do you like that?
- Well here goes!

233
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,620
Hey, you're good.

234
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,250
My wife, she's a good dancer,
isn't she Bigelow?

235
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,410
Oh..., yeah!

236
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:31,560
Fellas, I thought you were going to show us
a good time tonight, is this doing the town?

237
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,580
That's right, we practically bankrupt our
stores to buy everything you've got...

238
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,600
...then you keep us in this hotel room!

239
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,040
I agree.
This is my last night to howl

240
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,150
before I go back to being a dutiful housewife.

241
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,770
Well, it looks like we're stuck, boys.

242
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,350
This is where we blow all our
commission in one night.

243
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,300
- And you're coming with us, Bigelow.
- No, thanks...

244
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,320
you run along.
I've got to get unpacked and have dinner.

245
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,660
oh, no, you're not going to get
away from me.

246
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:59,630
Now that I've found a man who can dance,
I'm going to hang on to him!

247
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,960
- Man, am I hip!
- You're from nowhere, nowhere!

248
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,620
Blow it! Blow up a storm, Fisherman!

249
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,570
Stay with it!
Go, go on, get it, Fisherman!

250
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,630
- Have a little bit of my drink, Frank.
- No, thank you.

251
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,090
- Excuse me a moment.
- Where are you going?

252
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,310
Sue...I think you've had enough.

253
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,900
- What'll it be?
- Bourbon and water, no ice.

254
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,780
Nice quiet place you've got here!

255
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,200
Wait about an hour, that's when they
really go out of their minds.

256
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,080
Who's the blonde?

257
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:54,660
Oh, she's one of the chicks that hangs
around here, she's jive crazy.

258
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,830
- Come again?
- Oh, you ain't hip pal.

259
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,840
"Jive crazy" means that she goes for this stuff.
Just between you and me, I don't

260
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,710
get it either, but I got to listen to it.

261
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,670
They're all connoisseurs, music lovers.
Me, I like...

262
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,760
Guy Lombardo.

263
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,260
- What's the matter with him?
- He's flipped, the music's driving him crazy.

264
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,930
Come down, Jack!

265
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,060
Oh, don't bug me man!
I'm being enlightened.

266
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,480
- Is the blonde alone?
- Oh sure, "Society".

267
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:21,650
She always comes in alone. Drives a big
convertible, wears a mink coat,

268
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,200
knows everybody. But she always comes
in alone.

269
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,370
Thank you.

270
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,080
Give me another blast, Leo.

271
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,790
- What's your story, Jeannie?
- Easy.

272
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,210
- Hello.
- Easy. Dig the Fisherman.

273
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,470
- That's really silk, isn't it?
- Can I buy you a drink?

274
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,090
Sure, thanks. Give me a blast, Leo.

275
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,140
Leo, I left my "blast" at the other
end of the bar.

276
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,280
My name's Jeannie, what's yours?

277
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,240
- Frank.
- I've never seen you here before, Frank.

278
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,370
Well I've never been here before.

279
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:20,040
- This isn't mine, mine was Bourbon.
- Well sure it is, you saw me pour it.

280
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,210
- Gimme a fresh drink.
- Anything you say.

281
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,630
Listen to that piano,
feel those vibrations.

282
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:34,430
- You don't get your kicks outta this, do you?
- I can live without it!

283
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,560
- Why do you stay here?
- I don't know.

284
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,650
I bet I know,
you're lonely in a big city.

285
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:43,820
You don't have to go into a
routine with me.

286
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,940
I like good company too.

287
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,790
Say, there's some people there
that I want to avoid.

288
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,120
Couldn't we get out of here?

289
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,670
- Let me think about it.
- Come on, how about going somewhere else?

290
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,300
Why don't you meet me later?

291
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,880
OK. Where?

292
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:23,230
Call me at that number later,
it's my next stop.

293
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,980
They got a band there that'll
really send you.

294
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,690
- See you, Jeannie.
- Easy.

295
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,600
Never mind, operator.

296
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:22,670
Room service, please.

297
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,970
Come in.

298
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:34,770
- Be right with you, waiter.
- Yes Sir.

299
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,810
- Was this all, Sir?
- Yeah, sure.

300
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,900
- May I?
- Go ahead.

301
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,740
- I've signed there for you.
- Thank you Sir.

302
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:49,530
- Would you like anything else?
- No thank you, that's all.

303
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,080
- Waiter!
- Yes Sir?

304
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,380
Take this away.

305
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,510
- Is there anything wrong, Sir?
- No, just take it away.

306
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,470
I don't want to even look at it.

307
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:10,390
- Are you alright, Sir?
- Yes, sure.

308
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,850
Alright, I just had too big
a night I guess, that's all.

309
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,100
- I need some fresh air.
- Of course.

310
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,770
Thank you, Sir.

311
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,880
Lungs in good condition,
blood pressure normal...

312
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,920
heart fine. Well, it's a good thing that
everybody isn't like you, Mr. Bigelow,

313
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:31,390
- put us doctors out of business!
- Glad to hear it, Doctor, I was worried.

314
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,810
Don't let a little bellyache worry you,
could be just the change in climate.

315
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,890
Well it isn't exactly an ache, Doctor,
it's kind of hard to describe the feeling.

316
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,190
Maybe it was the drinks I had last night,
I might have mixed them too much, eh?

317
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,900
Let's have another look at that throat.

318
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:51,490
You may finish dressing now, Mr. Bigelow
I want to get the results of those tests.

319
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,370
Thank you, Doctor.

320
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:17,060
Mr. Bigelow, this is Dr. Schaefer.

321
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,930
- Hello Doctor, how are you?
- Sit down, Mr. Bigelow.

322
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:24,230
According to the information you gave
Miss Wilson, you're not married Mr. Bigelow.

323
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:28,220
- That's right.
- Do you have any relatives, family, anyone in San Francisico?

324
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,610
- No one. I don't know a soul in San Francisco.

325
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,070
- Where is your home?
- What is this, Doctor? Why all the questions?

326
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,830
- You're a very sick man, Mr. Bigelow.
- Sick!?

327
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,570
But you told me I was in good shape!

328
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,960
Yes, I know, but my preliminary examination
didn't reveal your true condition.

329
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,750
- You sound as if it's pretty serious, Doctor.
- It's extremely serious.

330
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:50,260
I want you to understand that we wouldn't tell you
something like this unless we were absolutely certain.

331
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,510
- Well of course, of course.
- You must steel yourself for a shock, Mr. Bigelow.

332
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,890
Well go on, Doctor, what is it you're
trying to tell me?

333
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,680
Our tests reveal the presence in your body
of a luminous toxic matter.

334
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:03,100
- What is that, exactly?
- A poison that attacks the vital organs.

335
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,810
- Poison?
- There is no alternative but to tell you this.

336
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,190
Your system has already absorbed
sufficient toxin to prove fatal.

337
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,530
I wish there was something
that we could do.

338
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,120
- What do you mean wish...?
- There is nothing ANYONE can do.

339
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,370
This is one of the few poisons of its type
for which there is no antidote.

340
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,790
This is fantastic! This is the most
ridiculous thing...

341
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,330
Mr. Bigelow, you don't have very long.

342
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,210
- What do you mean?
- A day, possibly a week,

343
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,580
two weeks at the outside.
It's hard to say exactly.

344
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,930
This is impossible, I don't believe it!

345
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,610
You've made a mistake.
That's it, it could be a mistake, couldn't it?

346
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,010
You have made a mistake, haven't you?
Answer me!

347
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,310
Dr. Schaefer is an authority on toxicology.

348
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:45,310
There's been no mistake, Mr. Bigelow.

349
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,610
Do you realise what you're saying?
You're telling me that I'm DEAD.

350
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:52,570
Do you think you can explain my life
away in just a few words?

351
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,990
Why, I don't even know who you are!
Why should I believe you?

352
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:58,820
You must calm yourself, Mr. Bigelow. We want
to offer you every assistance that...

353
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:01,830
Assistance? Who wants assistance?
Who wants anything from you?

354
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:05,940
You're nothing but a couple of phoneys. I
think you're crazy, both of you, you're crazy!

355
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,140
- Where's the Doctor?
- You can't come in here!

356
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,690
Come on, tell me!

357
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,580
What's the trouble here?
What's the matter with you?

358
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:34,490
Doctor, I want you to examine me
for luminous poison.

359
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,240
Come right in here.

360
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,620
Yeah, you've got it alright.

361
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:50,290
Your system has already absorbed it.

362
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,920
Are you sure, Doctor?
Are you absolutely certain?

363
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,260
Couldn't there be some mistake?

364
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,810
There it is. The toxin is actually
luminous in the dark.

365
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,270
No, there' no doubt about it, Bigelow.

366
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:11,650
I don't feel sick, my stomach is
just a little bit upset.

367
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,690
Maybe it's not as bad as you think, Doctor.

368
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,400
That's characteristic. With a heavy jolt
you go suddenly, in a matter of hours...

369
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:20,280
but if the stuff is taken in a lesser
degree, you last a while...

370
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,320
and then...

371
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,450
and then?

372
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,830
- Give it to me straight, Doctor!
- Well, a number of things are involved,

373
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,800
- the systemic condition of the individual,
the amount consumed,

374
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:37,630
- Yes
- you won't feel too badly for a while,

375
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:41,590
then it will happen suddenly,
a day, two days,

376
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,180
a week at the most.

377
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,730
A day!

378
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:53,480
- Two days!
- There's nothing that can be done, now.

379
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,150
If it had been caught in time,
your stomach could have been washed out.

380
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:59,780
But you've had it in you for some time now
for at least twelve hours , haven't you?

381
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,240
I don't know!

382
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,740
- You don't know?
- No!

383
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:07,080
Don't you know how you got it?
This is no accident,

384
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,580
somebody knew how to handle that stuff.
That wax is tasteless and odourless.

385
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,960
From the amount of alcohol in your body
you must have got it in liquor.

386
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,880
- I was drinking last night.
- Arrange for your admission to the hospital immediately.

387
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,630
Of course I'll have to notify the police.

388
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,180
- This is a case for Homicide.
- Homicide?

389
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,140
I don't think you fully understand, Bigelow.

390
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,140
You've been murdered.

391
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,150
Get me Police Headquarters please.

392
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,400
Homicide Bureau.

393
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:04,360
"A day, two days, a week at the most"

394
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,020
"You've been murdered."

395
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,980
"This is no accident.
Somebody knew how to handle that stuff."

396
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,360
"From the amount of alcohol in your body,
you must have got it from liquor."

397
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,900
"There's nothing that can be done now."

398
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,700
"You've been murdered."

399
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,780
"You've been murdered."

400
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,430
Open up!

401
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,520
Open this door, I tell you!

402
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,020
Open up or I'll break it down!

403
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,030
Where are those men?
Where are those men who were here last night?

404
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,810
I don't know, there are no men here.
Please go away...

405
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,360
- Don't lie to me! Where are they?
- Mister, this lady just checked in.

406
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,860
Those men aren't here no longer.
They checked out early this morning.

407
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,820
- Checked out?
- Please go away.

408
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,660
I'm sorry.

409
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:18,200
I'm terribly sorry.

410
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:26,340
- Hello?
- Please, Mr. Bigelow, my eardrums!

411
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,840
- Hello, Paula.
- Your enthusiasm overwhelms me.

412
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:35,470
Why haven't you phoned me?
Or is there a quota on telephone calls up there?

413
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:38,500
I'm sorry, I, I've been busy.

414
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,260
I'll bet you have,
visiting the museums no doubt.

415
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,550
What's happening up there that's
exciting or different?

416
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,070
- Nothing, not a thing.
- I'll bet you miss me,

417
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:50,530
but you're too stubborn to admit it.

418
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:53,540
You know, if you'd like me to come up,
I could pack a toothbrush right away.

419
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,660
- No!
- Well you don't have to snap my head off!

420
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:59,200
You could at least make a pretence
of missing me.

421
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,000
I'm sorry, Paula.

422
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,670
Of course I miss you.

423
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,380
Listen, Paula, I...

424
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:12,630
Paula, it's just that I don't feel
like talking now,

425
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,510
- I'll call you later.
- Don't strain yourself.

426
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,140
You phone me sometime when you
feel more like talking.

427
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,290
- By the way, I called that Mr. Phillips back.
- Phillips?

428
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,480
Yes, you know, the man that tried to reach you.

429
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,520
Well I'm afraid that you'll never know why
it was so important that he speak to you.

430
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,380
His office said he died yesterday.

431
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,180
Frank, are you there?

432
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,170
Did you hear me?

433
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,360
Die?

434
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,320
- When?
- Yesterday. So you won't have to bother

435
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:48,320
your little head about him any more,
you can just go ahead and have fun.

436
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,950
Paula, what did he die from, do you know?

437
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,760
I suppose he died from whatever people
usually die from.

438
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,650
Well didn't they tell you, don't you know?

439
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:00,780
What are you getting so excited about,
you said you didn't even know the man.

440
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:06,110
- Listen, where's his office located?
- What difference does it make? You can't talk to him now,
I told you the man's dead.

441
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:09,530
Paula will you stop talking so much,
and tell me where his office is!

442
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,230
Well alright.

443
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:16,860
It's the Phillips Importing and Exporting
Company,

444
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,260
Bradbury Building, Los Angeles.

445
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,120
- Bradbury Building, Los Angeles.
- That's right.

446
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,050
Say, this is really a switch!

447
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,070
Listen,if you want to reach me,
I'll be in Los Angeles.

448
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,860
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'm sorry, Paula, I've got to hurry!

449
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,870
Wait a minute, where in Los Angeles?

450
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,210
The Allison, The Allison Hotel.
Goodbye, Paula.

451
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,860
- I'd like to see someone in charge here.
- What does it regard to?

452
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:14,800
- It's a personal matter, it's quite urgent.
- Perhaps Mr. Halliday can help you.

453
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,770
- Who's he?
- He's our controller.

454
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,030
- Your name, please?
- Bigelow.

455
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,160
- Mr. Bigelow to see you.
- Send him in.

456
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,560
Go right in, please. That door.

457
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,230
- Mr. Bigelow.
- How are you, Mr. Halliday?

458
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,730
- What can I do for you?
- Well Mr. Phillips phoned

459
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,390
my office several times yesterday.

460
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,730
- I'd like to find out what it's all about.
- You know Mr. Phillips died yesterday?

461
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,440
- Yes, I know.
- Well I don't understand.

462
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:48,310
If he phoned you, didn't he
tell you what it was about?

463
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,650
Well he didn't speak to me,
I wasn't in my office at the time,

464
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,980
- and he wouldn't tell my secretary.
- Well I'm afraid I can't be of much help.

465
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,720
I've no idea why Mr. Phillips tried
to reach you.

466
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:01,240
I'm sorry you had to make the trip for nothing.

467
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,840
How do you know I made a trip?
I didn't say anything about making a trip,

468
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:08,730
I merely said he phoned my office.
My office could be here in Los Angeles.

469
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,350
Miss Foster!

470
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,220
- Yes?
- Didn't you mention something yesterday

471
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,680
about Mr. Phillips speaking with
Mr. Bigelow in San Francisco?

472
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,110
I said that he had phoned Mr. Bigelow's
office in Banning,

473
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,240
but that Mr. Bigelow was staying at the
St. Francis hotel in San Francisco.

474
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,910
- I'm sorry you misunderstood me.
- Do you know why Mr. Phillips called?

475
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:28,020
- No, I don't.
- Alright. Thank you, Miss Foster.

476
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:31,250
You can understand that we've been
somewhat upset around here,

477
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,890
now if you don't mind...

478
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,510
Did Mr. Phillips have a wife, family,
anyone that could help me?

479
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,070
You can't intrude on people at a time
like this

480
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,880
- just to satisfy some curiosity.
- It isn't just curiosity!

481
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:49,720
- Then I suggest you wait a week or so!
- I can't wait.

482
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,120
- Well I'm sorry, you'll have to!
- Well, there's always a phone book.

483
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,520
You're a pretty aggressive fellow, Bigelow.

484
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,640
Are you quite sure that this is as
important as you make it appear to be?

485
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,920
It's important.

486
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:01,930
Mrs. Phillips lives at the
Sunset Arms apartments.

487
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,180
- Thank you.
- I needn't tell you she's under a strain.

488
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:13,560
I suppose you're capable of using a little
more tact than you demonstrated with me?

489
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,070
I can handle it. By the way, what was the
cause of Mr. Phillips' death?

490
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,790
Suicide, he leaped from the balcony of
his apartment.

491
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,380
Thank you.

492
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,900
Come in, Mr. Bigelow.

493
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,200
I'm Stanley Phillips, Eugene's brother.

494
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,910
Halliday phoned that you were coming.

495
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,410
This is my sister-in-law, Mrs. Phillips.

496
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,080
I'll try to make this as brief
as possible, Mrs. Phillips.

497
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,840
I'm afraid I can't be of any help
to you, Mr. Bigelow

498
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,260
I haven't the slightest idea why
my husband wanted to speak to you.

499
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:09,600
Well I guess Halliday covered just
about everything.

500
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,020
Did your husband ever mention anything
about me, Mrs. Phillips, anything at all?

501
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:18,730
No, I can't recall Eugene ever having
mentioned your name.

502
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:31,290
I hate to ask you this, Mrs. Phillips,
but it's of vital importance to me.

503
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,830
Do you know why your husband
committed suicide?

504
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:44,220
You're certainly not the most diplomatic
person in the world, are you, Bigelow?

505
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:48,510
- Were you a friend of my brother's?
- I never met him.

506
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:57,350
My brother was in a jam, a pretty bad jam.

507
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,520
He was arrested two days ago.

508
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,110
He sold some iridium to a dealer
by the name of Majak.

509
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,900
It's a very rare metal, very costly

510
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,310
Anyway, the iridium turned out to be stolen.

511
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,690
He was released on bail yesterday,
but he faced a pretty stiff prison term.

512
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:14,500
- Men have committed suicide for less.
- Yes, I know, that's how the police see it.

513
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:16,950
What puzzles me, though, is this
crooked deal.

514
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:20,940
Knowing Eugene, you wouldn't say he was the
type of man to be mixed up in that, would you?

515
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:23,680
- I told you, I never met him.
- That's right, so you did.

516
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,650
- Now what's this all got to do with you?
- I don't know.

517
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:31,550
Let's come clean. Surely you must have some
idea why my brother wanted to speak to you.

518
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,430
- I have NO idea.
- That's odd.

519
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,530
Then how can it be of such vital
importance to you?

520
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,790
You seem to know the answer to
everything else,

521
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,020
Maybe you know the answer to that one, too.

522
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,750
There's a message here for you to call
operator 82 at Banning.

523
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:56,670
- Thank you.
- Show Mr. Bigelow to room 821.

524
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,510
Say, would you have the operator to put
this call through to my room right away?

525
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:01,170
Yes, right away.

526
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:03,890
Hello operator?

527
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:08,680
- Here. I'll call you if I need anything.
- Thank you, Sir.

528
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:12,330
- Hello, Paula?
- Well, Sinbad.

529
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:14,520
I'd just about given you up for lost.

530
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,330
Now do you mind telling me just why
you rushed down to Los Angeles?

531
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,870
I can't explain it to you just now, Paula, I...

532
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,140
- I just can't explain it.
- What's going on, Frank,

533
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:25,150
- you don't even sound like yourself?
- Well I.....
- I just can't explain it.
- What's going on, Frank,

534
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:27,370
- you don't even sound like yourself?
- Well I.....

535
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:32,380
I'm just a little tired, Paula, that's all.

536
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,750
But I miss you.

537
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:41,300
Oh, Frank. I can't tell you how good
it is to hear you say that.

538
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:44,190
And here I was worrying that I'd
lost my charm.

539
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,870
When are you coming home, Frank?

540
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:50,520
Soon, Paula.  I'll be home soon.

541
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:55,800
I'll go right out and get myself a permanent,
so I'll be pretty when you see me.

542
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,580
Hey, guess what? I found that Phillips name
in your notarial ledger.

543
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,110
- Notarial ledger?
- Yes, of all places.

544
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,820
I remember now, I made the entry myself.

545
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:09,900
You had notarised a paper one morning,
before I came to work.

546
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:13,830
- What kind of paper was it?
- A Bill of Sale, for a George Reynolds,

547
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:16,420
made out to Eugene Phillips, of Los Angeles.

548
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:20,090
So you see I was right, we hadn't done any
business with Phillips, only indirectly.

549
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:23,800
- What was the Bill of Sale for?
- A shipment of iridium, whatever that is.

550
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,680
- Iridium?
- You mentioned at the time

551
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,720
that this fellow Reynolds had made some
kind of a deal in Palm Springs, and he

552
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:32,400
stopped in your office early in the morning
on his way north to have it notarised.

553
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:36,600
Wait a minute! Wait a minute, George Reynolds.
That was about six months ago, wasn't it?

554
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,890
- That's right. Six months ago.
- Thanks, Pau...

555
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:42,610
Oh! Goodbye.

556
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:44,400
Goodbye?.

557
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:48,160
Hello, operator.
Get that number back for me.

558
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:12,100
I've got to talk to you, Mrs. Phillips.

559
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,780
Please, go away, I want to be left alone.

560
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:19,320
But I found out why your husband wanted to
see me, it was about a Bill of Sale.

561
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:22,050
- Come in.
- Thank you.

562
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,910
What do you know about a man
named George Reynolds?

563
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:27,400
- George Reynolds?
- Yes.

564
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,050
Why that's the man my husband claims
sold him the iridium.

565
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,650
- And what does Reynolds claim?
- Reynolds disappeared.

566
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:37,520
About two months ago, my husband grew
suspicious that something was wrong,

567
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,260
since then he tried in every way to locate
Reynolds,

568
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,560
- but could find no trace of him.
- I don't get it,

569
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,010
your husband could have proved he made a
legitimate deal by showing

570
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,560
- the Bill of Sale he got from Reynolds.
- Then there was a Bill of Sale?

571
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:50,460
- yes, yes of course there was.
- My husband swore there was,

572
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:52,730
but at the time of his arrest, he
couldn't find it,

573
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:56,580
- it was mysteriously missing.
- if your husband could have shown proof,

574
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:58,980
it would have been George Reynolds who
would have faced the prison term.

575
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:01,730
Eugene was convinced that Reynolds had
stolen the Bill of Sale.

576
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:05,500
He was the only one who had reason to
eliminate evidence of the transaction.

577
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,520
Thank you Mrs. Phillips, thank you
very much, you've been very helpful.

578
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,130
Oh, if only you'd come sooner,
Mr. Bigelow,

579
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:16,780
my husband might be alive today.

580
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,510
I know.

581
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,560
The only thing that puzzles me,
Mrs. Phillips,

582
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,000
is that you haven't asked how I knew
there was a Bill of Sale.

583
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,480
Mr. Halliday isn't in, he should be
back shortly.

584
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,530
I think you're the one who can help
me, Miss Foster,

585
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:51,660
Mr. Phillips tried to reach someone else
before he called me yesterday, didn't he.

586
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:55,040
- Why don't you ask Mr. Halliday.
- Obviously Mr. Halliday wasn't here yesterday,

587
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:57,290
or he wouldn't have had to learn from
you that Phillips called me,

588
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:00,000
and you're the logical person to know
who else Phillips called.

589
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:03,150
- I don't think that's any of your business.
- Don't think you're revealing anything

590
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:07,040
confidential, I know that he tried to reach
somebody else, Mrs. Phillips told me.

591
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:10,380
You're bluffing, Mr. Bigelow. I don't know what
you're after, but you're trying to trick me.

592
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,560
Mrs. Phillips didn't tell you a thing.

593
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,560
- How do you know that?
- Mrs. Phillips knows nothing about it.

594
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:17,710
She doesn't? Why wouldn't she...?

595
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:20,430
Wait a minute. I was talking about George
Reynolds...

596
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,930
Who did you think I meant, just who is it
that Mrs. Phillips doesn't know about?

597
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:26,700
- I told you, that's none of your business.
- I'll give it to you straight, Phillips was murdered.

598
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:29,650
- Murdered? I don't believe you.
- He called because he needed me to clear him.

599
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,860
Phillips was innocent, innocent men don't
have to jump out of windows!

600
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:34,310
- Murdered!
- Just who are you trying to protect?

601
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,210
- Why are you so afraid to tell the truth?
- I'm not protecting anybody!

602
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:41,320
- I haven't any more to say.
- This thing is going to explode wide open.

603
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,200
If you've got nothing to hide,
you'd better start talking.

604
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:45,180
- Or maybe you are mixed up in this!
- No!

605
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:48,010
- Well then come on!
- Mr. Phillips called Marla Rakubian,

606
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:51,100
- He went to see her yesterday morning.
- Who is Marla Rakubian?

607
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:54,160
She's a model. She and Mr. Phillips used
to be quite friendly,

608
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:57,070
but he hadn't been seeing her for some time.
The last couple of months

609
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,030
he's been trying to locate her.
He found out where she lived yesterday morning.

610
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,640
When he returned from seeing her, he was
terribly upset and excited,

611
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:05,620
that's when he had me to put in
the calls for you.

612
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,660
When he couldn't reach you he went home.
The last time I saw him alive.

613
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:12,290
Give me Marla Rakubian's address.

614
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,480
I don't think Mr. Phillips

615
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:18,000
realised I was aware of his friendship
with Marla Rakubian,

616
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:20,830
and out of respect for him I never intended
to tell anybody.

617
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,760
I had no idea she had anything to do with
the trouble he was in.

618
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:27,760
I admire your discretion, Miss Foster.

619
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:31,300
You know, you must be pretty friendly
with Stanley, Miss Foster,

620
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,710
he knew how desperately his brother
tried to reach me yesterday,

621
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,510
and he wasn't even here at the time.

622
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:40,030
And now you seem to know all about what
happened in Mrs. Phillips apartment.

623
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,380
- Miss Rakubian?
- Yes?

624
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,400
What do you want?
Get out of here or I'll call the police.

625
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:54,040
Go ahead, call them!

626
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:56,800
Well go ahead, call them!
Going on a trip, huh?

627
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:00,650
- Yes, going away for the weekend.
- Sailing for Buenos Aires tomorrow,

628
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:03,480
- some weekend!
- I'll send you a postcard, now get out!

629
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:06,610
- Who are you going with, George Reynolds?
- I've never heard of him.

630
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,560
I suppose you've never heard of
Eugene Phillips, either?

631
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,080
- Just who are you, what do you want?
- Never mind who I am

632
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,730
- Where's Reynolds?
- I told you I don't know him

633
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:16,000
now will you get out of here and
leave me alone?

634
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,870
So you've never heard of George Reynolds!

635
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,260
Don't tell me this isn't him,
because I've seen him!.

636
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:28,810
- If you think you can scare me, you're crazy.
- Look I know that Phillips came here yesterday.

637
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:31,210
And right after he left, he was pushed
out of a sixth storey window.

638
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:35,100
- Pushed? Phillips committed suicide.
- Your playmate Reynolds murdered Phillips

639
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:36,920
then he went up to San Francisco to get me

640
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:39,240
because I knew about a certain Bill of Sale.

641
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,040
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You're in this right up to your pretty neck.

642
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:45,790
I'm not mixed up in anything.
get your hands up!

643
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,460
Drop that picture on the couch.

644
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:49,100
Turn around!

645
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:53,750
Don't get any ideas, because I'm not
afraid to use this.

646
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:55,860
Give me your wallet.

647
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:02,600
Frank Bigelow, hotel Alli...

648
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:09,070
- Alright, now where's Reynolds?
- I don't know where he is.

649
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:12,390
- Is that what you told Phillips, yesterday?
- I told him exactly what I'm telling you..

650
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,630
I haven't heard from him in months.

651
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,780
Yeah? You're mighty careful of the picture
of a man you haven't heard from in months.

652
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:20,830
- What does the "Ray" stand for?
- It was a pet name. Do you mind?

653
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,840
It all sounds very cosy, Miss Rakubian,

654
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,970
You and Reynolds call each other pet names
while you make a sucker out of Phillips.

655
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,580
Phillips made the deal because he wanted it!

656
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:31,860
Yeah? Well I bet you weren't above using what
it takes to help MAKE him want it.

657
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:35,380
- Who's paying for this trip?
- I am!

658
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:40,160
Really? A first class trip to Buenos Aires
on a model's salary. Don't make me laugh!

659
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:44,330
Since you and Reynolds aren't seeing each
other any more, you don't mind if I keep this.

660
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:48,610
If I were a man I'd punch your dirty face in.

661
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,900
You know, I really believe you would.

662
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,070
Oh, I almost forgot.

663
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,950
Your tickets.

664
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,380
Don't be surprised if I'm there to see you off.

665
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,390
Angelo!

666
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:25,520
Angelo!

667
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,860
Oh, Angelo. Do you remember taking this
picture of a George Reynolds?

668
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:34,320
I take so many pictures I can't
remember them all.

669
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,300
This gentleman is a friend of his,
and would like his address.

670
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,120
- We have no card on him.
- I don't think we ought to do that.

671
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,510
He's willing to pay twenty dollars for it.

672
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:43,610
That's the paper we used last year.

673
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:46,600
Of course you understand we usually
don't give out information about our clients.

674
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:48,800
- I know, you're a couple of high class fellas.
- Thank you.

675
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:52,040
Revealing anything confidential is against
the ethics of our establishment.

676
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:54,820
- That's right, honesty is the best policy.
- Of course.

677
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:58,420
But in your case, in as much you're a
personal friend of Mr. Reynolds...

678
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:00,430
- Thanks, I knew you'd come through.
- Got it.

679
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,750
Here it is. We don't have his address, he
must have called for the picture.

680
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,680
But he could not have been a very good friend
of yours, Mister

681
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:08,860
because his name is not George Reynolds.

682
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,110
It isn't? Then what is it?

683
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:16,600
- It's Ray...
- Huh....? Oh, here.

684
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,770
- It's Raymond Rakubian.
- Rakubian?

685
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:25,240
what's so unusual about that?
The picture's signed Ray, isn't it?

686
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,160
Yeah!

687
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:30,280
Yeah!!

688
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,450
Thanks!

689
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,760
Bigelow! Are you alright?

690
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,140
- Can I get you anything?
- No, no thanks.

691
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,950
- Do you know this man?
- No. No, I don't think so.

692
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:36,090
- Are you sure you've never seen him?
- I'm quite sure.

693
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,470
Does the name Raymond Rakubian mean
anything to you?

694
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:43,150
- No, I never heard of him, why?
- He also uses the name George Reynolds.

695
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,820
This is Reynolds?
Where can we find him?

696
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,740
That's what I want to know.
Tell me something, Halliday.

697
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:52,330
You're the controller here, how come
you didn't know about that Bill of Sale?

698
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:56,210
- Phillips made that deal before I came here.
- Yeah, but you still keep records, don't you?

699
00:56:56,420 --> 00:57:00,750
For some reason, which is none of my business,
Phillips kept that among his personal papers.

700
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,550
Now does that answer your question?

701
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:08,220
You came in here today asking for information
that you needed, and I tried to cooperate,

702
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:11,010
but now you're beginning to annoy me.

703
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,890
So get out before I throw you out!

704
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:22,560
You know, you really frighten me.

705
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:53,470
Well, it's about time you showed up,
Bigelow.

706
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,180
Go ahead, Dave.

707
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,360
Real cute, ain't you , Bigelow.
Just real cute.

708
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:06,030
Marla didn't lose much time in getting
hold of you guys, did she?

709
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:08,240
Shut up! Let's go, Bigelow!

710
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,320
Look at him! He can't take it.

711
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,740
Soft in the belly.

712
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:17,540
You do that again and I'll kick your face in.

713
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,250
- Lay off, Chester, cut it out.
- Shut up! Who asked you?

714
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,670
Better let him answer it,
the clerk might know he's in.

715
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,510
Go ahead, Bigelow.

716
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:35,720
- Hello?
- Frank!

717
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:38,640
Frank, why did you hang up on me?
I've been trying to get you for hours.

718
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:41,600
I'm sorry, Paula, I was in a hurry.

719
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:45,410
Well don't be in such a hurry this time,
you didn't give me a chance to finish.

720
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:48,650
- It's a dame.
- McGowen was in hollering his head off

721
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:53,530
- because you didn't go over the books.
- Tell McGowen to get another auditor.

722
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:57,540
Sure, I'll just do that little thing, and
lose the best-paying account we've got.

723
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:59,450
Do as I tell you, Paula.

724
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:02,420
Frank, are you drunk?

725
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:05,710
Paula, how much have we got in the bank?

726
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:08,590
About $2200.

727
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:10,670
Draw it out tomorrow.

728
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:15,220
Sure! Then what do we do, skip town
without paying our bills?

729
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,680
Forget the bills. You know that coat you
always wanted?

730
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:20,180
Buy it.

731
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:24,190
You are drunk. You know, if I didn't have
such a good character

732
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:28,360
I'd be tempted to take advantage of your
intoxicated state, Mr. Bigelow.

733
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,990
I'm not drunk, Paula.

734
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:33,280
Well don't tell me that one day away from
me can affect you this way!

735
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,240
Cut it short.

736
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,200
- Paula.
- Yes?

737
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:41,960
I'm sorry...

738
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:44,210
I left you.

739
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,000
I never realised how much I love you,

740
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,460
but I know it now.

741
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:52,050
Oh Frank, Frank darling,

742
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:56,050
I love you too, so very much.

743
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:58,310
Please come home,

744
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,640
I miss you terribly.

745
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:03,690
I said cut it short!

746
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,310
I'd just love to let you have it, Bigelow.

747
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,110
Let's go, Chester.
This guy's kept us waiting long enough now.

748
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:12,240
Walk in front, Bigelow.

749
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:15,220
And keep your mouth shut.

750
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:19,250
If you so much as look cross-eyed at anybody,
I'll blow the back of your skull out.

751
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,650
This Bigelow is real cute,

752
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,170
He wanted to get tough with Chester.
He don't know Chester.

753
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:42,360
Did you get the picture?

754
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:45,130
Don't I always get what Mr. Majak
sends me after?

755
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:46,550
Majak?

756
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,850
That's right.

757
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:53,580
I'm the dealer who bought the
iridium from Phillips.

758
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:57,800
I get it, you have Rakubian unload
stolen stuff on Phillips,

759
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,280
to help Marla here,
and then you buy it back from him.

760
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,980
Oh, you certainly made a sucker out
of Phillips.

761
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:09,520
What is it, Mr. Bigelow?
Exactly what is on your mind?

762
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:12,840
- I'm looking for Raymond Rakubian.
- Why?

763
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:17,120
Why now Marla has told you everything else,
I'm sure she must have told you that too.

764
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:21,430
You don't expect me to believe
this, conversation?

765
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,600
So what is on your mind,
I mean , underneath?

766
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,990
You forced your way into my affairs,
and now I want to know why.

767
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:33,200
I just told you, I'm looking
for Raymond Rakubian.

768
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,550
Don't get cute.
I'm just itching to work you over.

769
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:39,430
Soft in the belly, can't take it.

770
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:42,190
See, what'd I tell you?

771
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:56,860
You can't do that to Chester.
I'm going to blow your guts out!

772
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:59,520
Easy, lay off Chester, not now.

773
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:06,280
Look at him, he's so scared of Chester
he'll talk now.

774
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:08,340
He's not afraid, Chester.

775
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,600
You can tell from a man's eyes
when he is afraid.

776
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,430
Look at his eyes.

777
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:35,200
I'm telling you Majak, you'd better keep him
away from me, or he'll have to use that gun.

778
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:38,310
Go away, Chester, please.

779
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,420
Do what I tell you, my boy, please.

780
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:46,480
And help Dave.

781
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:53,410
Ah, you're in pain.

782
01:02:56,050 --> 01:02:58,310
He's an unfortunate boy.

783
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,380
He's psychopathic.

784
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,230
He's unhappy unless he gives pain.

785
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,740
He likes to see blood.

786
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:11,220
Come with me, Mr. Bigelow.

787
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:19,640
Raymond Rakubian was my nephew.

788
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:24,050
He could not possibly have tried to kill you.
He's been dead, five months.

789
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:33,110
I'm afraid you have been sidetracked,

790
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:37,370
provided it is true that somebody
made an attempt on your life?

791
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:39,950
Somebody made an attempt again today.

792
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,830
I had no reason to kill you, believe me.

793
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:45,930
What do you mean, you had no reason.
I notarised a certain Bill of Sale.

794
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:50,830
You notarised a Bill of Sale for
Reynolds, not Rakubian.

795
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,580
What I told you is true,
I had no reason to kill you.

796
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:57,060
That's a closet Mr. Bigelow.

797
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,680
And under other circumstances

798
01:03:59,890 --> 01:04:01,680
you could go home now,

799
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:06,800
but, now you present a problem.

800
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:10,620
You know too much, and I am in danger.
Chester!

801
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,300
Suppose I were able to prove to you that I
only want to find

802
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:16,780
the person who tried to kill me,
and I won't cause you any trouble?

803
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:19,780
You know I can go to jail for
ten years for this little business?

804
01:04:19,870 --> 01:04:21,290
Ten years!

805
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:26,140
At my age that's my life,
that means my entire life.

806
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:30,510
With my life I do not take chances,
I am sorry, believe me.

807
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,500
You want Joe to go with you?

808
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:34,760
No, just Bigelow and me,

809
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:38,140
- and baby makes three.
- But, Majak...

810
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:42,230
Goodbye, Mr. Bigelow, and forgive me.

811
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:44,350
Let's go, Bigelow.

812
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,350
I guess you won't be there,
to "see me off".

813
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:08,450
You tried to make a boob out of me,
in front of Majak.

814
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:11,240
Shouldn't have done that Bigelow,
I don't like that.

815
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,370
I'm going to enjoy this, Bigelow.

816
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,590
I done jobs like this before.

817
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:23,050
I knocked off guys I could like.

818
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:25,630
But I don't like you, Bigelow.

819
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:29,050
I never liked that puss of yours
from the minute I seen it.

820
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:32,060
Yeah.

821
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,850
I'm gonna enjoy this.

822
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:54,190
Ain't scared yet, are you Bigelow?
But you'll be scared, good and scared.

823
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:58,750
I think I'll give it to you in the belly.
You don't like it in the belly.

824
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,680
Go ahead, try it.

825
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:10,300
I'd just love you to try it.

826
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:12,850
Why don't you try it? Go ahead.

827
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,770
Didn't have the nerve, did you Bigelow?

828
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:24,480
Yeah, I think I'll give it to you
right in the belly.

829
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,420
Takes longer when you get it in the belly,

830
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,210
s'nice and slow...

831
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:44,460
That's the way I want to see you go, Bigelow,

832
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:46,130
nice and slow.

833
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:51,340
Frank!

834
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,220
- Frank, Are you alright?
- Yes, I'm alright, Paula, but what are you doing here?

835
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:07,060
- How did you get here?
- Freddie Ross ran me down, I had to see you

836
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:10,560
- You shouldn't have come Paula.
- What is it Frank?

837
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:12,600
You're in some kind of trouble, I know it.

838
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:15,570
Look at you, you're a sight!
Your clothes look as if you slept in them.

839
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:18,930
Are you ill? You are, you're feverish.

840
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:21,430
I'm alright, Paula.
And I'm not in any trouble, believe me.

841
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:25,380
Right after I spoke to you, I got a phone call
from the San Francisco police,

842
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,910
- they asked if I knew where you were.
- You didn't tell them anything, did you?

843
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,230
Of course not.
It was the homicide detective that called.

844
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,770
What is it Frank? If you're in any
kind of trouble you certainly can trust me.

845
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:39,640
Look I'm not in trouble with
the police, believe me

846
01:09:39,730 --> 01:09:42,360
but you can't stay here, you've got to go
back to Banning right away.

847
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:45,280
No I won't go Frank, I'm staying here with you.

848
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,160
Paula, it's better that you go back,
believe me.

849
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:49,310
Why? What's this all about?

850
01:09:49,650 --> 01:09:52,640
What have you got to do with this Phillips
and Reynolds?

851
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:57,490
- Phillips was murdered.
- Murd...

852
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:00,070
What could that have to do with you?

853
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:03,080
All you did was notarise a paper,
you've notarised hundreds of papers

854
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:07,980
I know, all I did was notarise a paper,
one little paper out of hundreds!

855
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:11,380
Frank, you frighten me. You don't
even act like yourself.

856
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:14,020
I know that you're in trouble,
that something is wrong,

857
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:17,410
that you're in serious trouble.
You frighten me, Frank!

858
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:20,150
Oh, don't be frightened, Paula.

859
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:23,200
Don't ever be frightened of anything
again, will you promise me that?

860
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:26,600
I love you so much darling,
more than you seem able to understand.

861
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:29,910
I never really knew happiness until
I loved you.

862
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:33,000
Sometimes when I was afraid that you weren't
sure how you felt,

863
01:10:33,010 --> 01:10:37,720
I tried to hold back, but I couldn't.
Losing you would be losing everything,

864
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,630
- there would have been nothing left.
- Don't, Paula, don't.

865
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:41,870
Now I'm afraid again.

866
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:44,600
Somehow I feel I'm going to lose you, but
there's nothing I can do about it.

867
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:47,230
I feel so helpless.
You're leaving me out of something.

868
01:10:47,530 --> 01:10:51,600
Tell me Frank, what is it? Give me a chance
to fight back, just give me a chance, please.

869
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:55,150
- You do love me?
- Oh yes, Paula, I love you.

870
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:57,250
I never was more certain of
anything in my life.

871
01:10:57,250 --> 01:11:01,070
I wasn't sure before, I was a little blind
I guess, but believe me I'm sure now.

872
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,400
- Can you understand that, Paula?
- I understand.

873
01:11:03,610 --> 01:11:05,310
A man can be like that, Paula,

874
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,450
something has to happen, a big thing
or a little thing,

875
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:12,520
but it can make him realise how much someone
means to him, how much he really loves,

876
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,950
And I love you, Paula,

877
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:18,780
more than I thought it possible, to love
anyone in the world, I love you.

878
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:21,150
Then why won't you tell me about this
trouble you're in?

879
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:23,410
Why won't you let me help you?

880
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,640
- You can't help me, Paula.
- You don't want my help.

881
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:30,420
Paula, there's nothing you can do,
will you believe me?

882
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,700
So will you please go home, please?

883
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:34,980
No, Frank, I won't go.

884
01:11:35,470 --> 01:11:38,560
I know you're in trouble,
I can't leave you like this.

885
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:43,950
Alright Paula, wait for me in the lobby of
the hotel and I'll be back for you soon.

886
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:46,920
- You promise?
- Yes Paula, I promise.

887
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:49,570
Is that a new outfit?

888
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,330
- Yes.
- It's beautiful.

889
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,970
- You'll come back to me, won't you Frank?
- Yes, Paula, I'll come back, I promise.

890
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:07,560
Please hurry, darling. I love you.

891
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:09,370
I love you, Paula.

892
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:17,320
Goodbye, Paula.

893
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:51,730
- Is Stanley here?
- No.

894
01:12:51,970 --> 01:12:53,590
You sure?

895
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:55,650
Alright, get in there.

896
01:12:56,750 --> 01:13:00,390
Get Stanley on the phone, tell him to come
over right away. Use any excuse you want.

897
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:04,660
- What are you going to do?
- What was Stanley going to do when
he used me for a clay pigeon today?

898
01:13:04,670 --> 01:13:08,000
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Don't act innocent, I fell for that once.

899
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:10,820
I don't know what you mean, I told you
everything you want to know this morning.

900
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:15,160
Yes, just enough so I got sidetracked and wouldn't
know that Stanley was the one I was after.

901
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,860
Stanley?

902
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:20,720
- Oh no!
- You've been together on this from the start.

903
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,270
Now come on, get on that phone and call him.

904
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,240
And don't let him know I'm here.

905
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:38,650
You've been sidetracked alright,

906
01:13:39,170 --> 01:13:41,600
but it was the poor bereaved little widow
who did it.

907
01:13:42,410 --> 01:13:44,530
Miss. Foster found this letter this afternoon.

908
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:46,600
In my brother's desk at the office,

909
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,560
postmarked two years ago...

910
01:13:48,970 --> 01:13:53,100
It isn't exactly the kind of letter that a
married woman gets from a casual friend.

911
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:56,100
I'm sure my brother wasn't aware they were
so well acquainted

912
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,200
when he hired Halliday.

913
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,930
- What's the matter with him?
- He hasn't felt right since dinner.

914
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:05,100
- Where did he have dinner?
- At Mrs. Phillips apartment.

915
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:08,340
Halliday was there too, and Stanley
confronted them with that letter.

916
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:11,440
- Did you have anything to drink?
- Yes, why?

917
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:14,390
- How long ago?
- Half an hour ago, just before I came here.

918
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,540
Miss Foster, get on the phone and call the
emergency immediately, get an ambulance here.

919
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:21,350
Tell them to prepare a stomach wash
for luminous poisoning.

920
01:14:21,610 --> 01:14:23,510
- Luminous poisoning?
- Go on, do what I tell you.

921
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:25,190
You may still have a chance to save his life.

922
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,500
Go on!

923
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:43,900
I found George Reynolds, Mrs. Phillips.

924
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,990
He's been dead for five months.

925
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:50,030
- Then he didn't steal the Bill of Sale.
- No, he didn't, but you could have stolen it.

926
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:52,210
How dare you?

927
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:54,410
You knew who I was when I came here today,

928
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,210
but you were surprised to see me alive,
weren't you?

929
01:14:57,290 --> 01:14:59,580
But I'm not alive, Mrs. Phillips,

930
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:02,800
sure I can stand here and talk to you,
I can breathe and I can move,

931
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,570
but I'm not alive, because I did take
that poison,

932
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,720
and nothing can save me.

933
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,890
- What are you going to do?
- If I kill you now, I have nothing to lose

934
01:15:13,970 --> 01:15:16,390
No, listen to me, you've got to
give me a chance!

935
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,270
But I didn't have a chance.

936
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:20,350
It was Halliday, believe me it was Halliday!

937
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,560
He made me steal the Bill of Sale,
he planned everything.

938
01:15:22,650 --> 01:15:25,070
What about this letter? Your husband knew
about you and Halliday!

939
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:27,490
He found it only yesterday.
He accused Halliday,

940
01:15:27,570 --> 01:15:29,950
they fought, and Halliday pushed him
over this balcony.

941
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,450
And why me?
Why did he want to kill me?

942
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:34,450
Because you could have proved there was
a Bill of Sale.

943
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:36,540
That my husband had no reason to
commit suicide.

944
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:39,670
Halliday was desperate.
After he killed my husband

945
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:41,710
he found out about the phone
calls to you,

946
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:44,590
he thought you spoke to him, that
you knew enough to involve him.

947
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:03,340
Where is Halliday?
Where is he?

948
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:05,480
He's in the office.

949
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,360
This time you don't warn him.

950
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:12,420
Majak!

951
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:21,050
Come on, Mister, break it up.

952
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:24,520
Come on, come on!

953
01:19:27,390 --> 01:19:28,980
Come on, move along.

954
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,610
Come on, break it up, let's get going.

955
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:35,510
All I did was notarise a Bill of Sale.

956
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:39,140
But that piece of paper could
have proven that..

957
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:42,070
..Phillips didn't commit suicide.

958
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:47,600
He was murdered, and that's why
Halliday poisoned me.

959
01:21:54,370 --> 01:21:56,710
Would you...?

960
01:22:04,190 --> 01:22:06,410
Pau... Paula!

961
01:22:18,950 --> 01:22:20,920
Call the morgue.

962
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,400
Johnson, you go to the Allison hotel,
find Paula Gibson,

963
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:30,500
don't tell her anything.
I'll break it to her.

964
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:36,900
How shall I make out the report
on him, Captain?

965
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:42,280
Better make it "Dead on Arrival".
