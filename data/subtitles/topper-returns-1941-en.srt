3
00:02:05,295 --> 00:02:07,712
Hey, you're alright down there?

4
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:22,987
Stay where you are. Don't move, keep calm!

5
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,578
Don't get excited. I'll get you out of there right away.

6
00:02:26,588 --> 00:02:28,073
Keep calm.

7
00:02:33,163 --> 00:02:35,195
Want to help?

8
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,215
There you are.

9
00:02:39,215 --> 00:02:40,485
What did we hit?

10
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:43,399
Nothing. We had a blow out.

11
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:47,205
I don't understand it, either. That was a brand new tire this morning.

12
00:02:47,807 --> 00:02:49,243
What's the matter? You sure you're alright?

13
00:02:50,374 --> 00:02:52,198
A little shaky, I guess.

14
00:02:52,225 --> 00:02:54,313
Come on. Sit down over here.

15
00:02:56,717 --> 00:02:59,426
What am I, an orphan?

16
00:03:01,424 --> 00:03:02,885
Come on.

17
00:03:03,511 --> 00:03:06,199
Any man that drives this fast as you ought to be run out of this country.

18
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:08,444
You tell me all about it some time.

19
00:03:09,324 --> 00:03:10,977
Thanks for the lift, buddy.

20
00:03:12,346 --> 00:03:13,896
Say I'm awfully sorry about this.

21
00:03:13,896 --> 00:03:15,534
You're sorry. How about us?

22
00:03:15,534 --> 00:03:16,456
We can't stay here all night.

23
00:03:16,456 --> 00:03:17,439
Well, you won't have to.

24
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,055
I said I'll get you to Carrington Hall and I will.

25
00:03:19,095 --> 00:03:20,829
How? You're going to fly us on a broom?

26
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:23,896
I'll get help. We passed a garage about 2 miles back.

27
00:03:23,896 --> 00:03:27,236
Now you take it easy and don't worry about a thing. I'll be back in a flash with a tow car.

28
00:03:27,236 --> 00:03:29,727
Why it's as simple as falling off a log.

29
00:03:30,215 --> 00:03:32,648
Hah... comfortable?!

30
00:03:34,316 --> 00:03:35,940
Don't go away, now.

31
00:03:42,298 --> 00:03:44,318
Must have been his wife with him.

32
00:04:03,424 --> 00:04:06,776
Uh-oh. Danger ahead. Two of 'em.

33
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,605
Oh, thank you. It was awfully sweet of you to stop for us.

34
00:04:11,605 --> 00:04:13,267
- But I...
- Ann you get in the back seat.

35
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:14,631
Can you manage the bags?

36
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:15,882
Yes, I think so.

37
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:18,835
Never mind. There.

38
00:04:18,835 --> 00:04:20,279
Now, mind if I sit on you lap?

39
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:24,570
- Oh really, my dear young lady I 
- I really sorry but we have to inconvenience you but we had a blow out.

40
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,931
This is comfortable. Well, what are we waiting for?

41
00:04:27,972 --> 00:04:29,796
Oh, very well Eddie. Drive on.

42
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:31,676
Yes, sir.

43
00:04:32,996 --> 00:04:35,516
Would you mind telling me where you ladies are taking me?

44
00:04:35,516 --> 00:04:37,006
To the Carrington Estate.

45
00:04:37,006 --> 00:04:38,121
Uh-oh.

46
00:04:38,185 --> 00:04:40,210
Is there anything wrong with the Carrington Place?

47
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,151
Yes, ma'am. If there wasn't anybody living there, it would be a haunted house.

48
00:04:49,532 --> 00:04:51,708
My, my Cosmo is late.

49
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,043
He's usually home by now.

50
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,394
My it's chilly isn't it?

51
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:59,922
Emily remind me to send this coat back. It doesn't keep me warm at all.

52
00:04:59,922 --> 00:05:02,202
Mrs. Topper you haven't got it on.

53
00:05:02,853 --> 00:05:04,239
Oh, how silly of me.

54
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:08,959
Why strange how it's usually so cold in the winter and warm in the summer, isn't it?

55
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,777
Oh, there's Cosmo now! Hello!

56
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:16,440
Oh look. Someone's waving to us.

57
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,126
It's a lady.

58
00:05:18,126 --> 00:05:21,357
It's worse than that, boss. It's Mrs. Topper.

59
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,915
Emily, look! He's got a car load of women.

60
00:05:27,915 --> 00:05:31,164
And one of them... one of them is sitting on his lap!

61
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,983
Oh my, Emily!

62
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:56,656
Well, here it is.

63
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,885
Are you sure this is the Carrington Place?

64
00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:00,288
Yes, that's what they call it.

65
00:06:00,288 --> 00:06:02,598
Cheerfully little eye full, isn't it?

66
00:06:06,356 --> 00:06:08,040
Thanks for the lift, Mr. Topper.

67
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,474
Don't mention it. Hurry up with those bags Eddie.

68
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:13,612
Yes, sir. I waste no time around here.

69
00:06:15,556 --> 00:06:17,451
I'd like to invite you in but...

70
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:19,927
Ah, no thanks. Very well, we got to be getting home.

71
00:06:19,927 --> 00:06:21,360
We sure do.

72
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,792
Good Bye.

73
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:25,884
Good Bye.

74
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:29,558
Bye.

75
00:06:29,558 --> 00:06:31,434
Good evening.

76
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:33,521
Why don't you knock before you come out?

77
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:35,979
I'm the butler, Miss Carrington.

78
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,448
Oh I'm not Miss Carrington. There she is.

79
00:06:38,448 --> 00:06:39,835
How do you do.

80
00:06:39,835 --> 00:06:42,255
Won't you please step in.

81
00:07:11,604 --> 00:07:13,272
- Miss Carrington?
- Yes.

82
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:15,187
I'm Lillian the housekeeper.

83
00:07:15,187 --> 00:07:18,037
How do you do. This is my friend, Miss Richards.

84
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,064
Howdy.

85
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,608
- Your father is waiting, Miss.
- Thank you.

86
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:25,453
Would you mind waiting here! This way please.

87
00:07:32,194 --> 00:07:34,314
<i>One moment please.</i>

88
00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:38,873
Miss Carrington.

89
00:07:38,873 --> 00:07:42,166
This is Dr. Jeris your father's physician.

90
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,950
How do you do, Dr. Jeris.

91
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:47,896
I'd like a few words with you, Miss Carrington before you see your father.

92
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,365
Of course.

93
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:55,494
I'll be as brief as possible. Your father is far from being a well man, Miss Carrington.

94
00:07:55,494 --> 00:07:57,262
Yes, I know.

95
00:07:57,262 --> 00:08:01,706
Seeing you for the first time may be something of a shock to him.

96
00:08:01,706 --> 00:08:03,922
I think I understand doctor.

97
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:08,068
He's been looking forward to your arrival with great eagerness.

98
00:08:09,108 --> 00:08:14,501
I hope there will never an occasion for you to be separated from him again.

99
00:08:14,501 --> 00:08:16,250
Come with me, please.

100
00:08:40,237 --> 00:08:45,042
Mr. Carrington.
Mr. Carrington!

101
00:08:45,915 --> 00:08:47,989
Mmmph

102
00:08:48,058 --> 00:08:50,618
This is your daughter.

103
00:09:08,775 --> 00:09:11,308
Ann.

104
00:09:12,612 --> 00:09:17,628
I... I don't know quite what to do or say!

105
00:09:19,214 --> 00:09:22,015
Nor do I.

106
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:26,574
Except to tell you, Ann you're beautiful.

107
00:09:26,591 --> 00:09:29,972
You're the image of your mother when she was young.

108
00:09:31,386 --> 00:09:34,307
Perhaps you'd better sit down.

109
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,281
Yes.

110
00:09:40,815 --> 00:09:46,677
I know you must think it very strange, seeing your own father for the first time,

111
00:09:46,677 --> 00:09:49,795
on the eve of your twenty-first birthday.

112
00:09:49,795 --> 00:09:53,413
Well naturally, I wondered why you never sent for me.

113
00:09:53,413 --> 00:09:55,900
Your mother loved the far east, Ann.

114
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:00,386
Her last wish was for you to be brought up in the land she loved so well.

115
00:10:00,386 --> 00:10:04,982
I wanted to send for you many times but I had to respect your mother wishes.

116
00:10:04,982 --> 00:10:08,113
Of course my own health wouldn't permit me to visit you.

117
00:10:08,128 --> 00:10:10,878
I understand, father.

118
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:12,472
I hope you had a pleasant trip?

119
00:10:12,472 --> 00:10:15,374
Yes we, we had a wonderful trip!

120
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,537
We?

121
00:10:16,537 --> 00:10:18,213
Oh, I brought a friend along with me.

122
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:20,743
An American girl named Gail Richards.

123
00:10:20,743 --> 00:10:23,464
Her father is the head of an exporting company in Shanghai.

124
00:10:23,464 --> 00:10:24,794
Richards, you say?

125
00:10:24,794 --> 00:10:26,807
Mmmm.

126
00:10:26,807 --> 00:10:30,497
Why, I hope you don't mind my bringing her?

127
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,652
Oh, of course not!

128
00:10:32,652 --> 00:10:34,872
Besides, the house belongs to you now.

129
00:10:34,877 --> 00:10:37,259
No father, to us.

130
00:10:37,298 --> 00:10:43,512
No my dear. By the terms of your mother's will, everything belongs to after tomorrow.

131
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:46,948
What else do you do around here besides wind clocks?

132
00:10:48,852 --> 00:10:50,019
Been here long?

133
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:50,967
Twenty years.

134
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:52,342
Twenty years.

135
00:10:52,342 --> 00:10:54,763
Looks like it might turn out to be a steady job. Huh?

136
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:01,136
Your mother wanted you to have these Ann.

137
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:05,146
There exactly as she wore them twenty years ago.

138
00:11:05,146 --> 00:11:08,727
Oh, Dad! There..there beautiful!

139
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,652
They'll look every bit as beautiful on you as they did upon your mother.

140
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:17,084
Dad, I never did know just how mother died.

141
00:11:17,084 --> 00:11:19,548
Some sort of an accident, wasn't it?

142
00:11:19,585 --> 00:11:25,565
Yes, dear. A mine cave in.

143
00:11:25,573 --> 00:11:28,258
I met your mother in Singapore.

144
00:11:28,258 --> 00:11:31,625
After you were born, we decided to move to Sumatra

145
00:11:31,627 --> 00:11:34,371
where I had an interest with a Tungstine mine.

146
00:11:34,406 --> 00:11:38,824
My partner was a man called Walter Harburk.

147
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:45,919
One day he was showing your mother through the mine. Suddenly there was an earthquake.

148
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:46,878
The tunnel collapsed.

149
00:11:46,878 --> 00:11:49,815
You've talked enough, Mr. Carrington.

150
00:11:49,846 --> 00:11:54,024
I'm sorry to interrupt, but we mustn't tire your father.

151
00:11:54,024 --> 00:11:56,302
Oh, of course not.

152
00:11:56,358 --> 00:11:57,958
I hope you like your room, dear.

153
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,169
I'm sure I will.

154
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:04,681
Lillian will show you where it is. I'm supposed to conserve my strength.

155
00:12:04,714 --> 00:12:05,963
-Quite alright father.
-Good night.

156
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,906
Goodnight, darling. See you in the morning.

157
00:12:08,906 --> 00:12:10,317
Goodnight.

158
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:11,567
Good Night, Dr. Gerad.

159
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:14,265
Good night, Miss Carrington.

160
00:12:17,217 --> 00:12:18,647
Where's Miss Richards?

161
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:21,064
Here am I, pal.

162
00:12:24,466 --> 00:12:26,169
Ann! Ann, look out!

163
00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:28,035
Look out!

164
00:12:29,751 --> 00:12:31,135
Ann!

165
00:12:31,771 --> 00:12:33,093
Ann!

166
00:12:33,093 --> 00:12:34,774
Ann!

167
00:12:34,774 --> 00:12:36,559
Ann, are you hurt?

168
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:39,365
Oh, no. I'm alright.

169
00:12:39,422 --> 00:12:42,471
Oh! What on earth happened?

170
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:43,342
Well, I don't know.

171
00:12:43,378 --> 00:12:44,798
That was a rather close call.

172
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:48,931
Close? Six more inches, and we'd all be singing 
 "Annie doesn't live here anymore."

173
00:12:48,931 --> 00:12:50,251
How could such a thing happen.

174
00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:53,767
Please, Mr. Carrington. You mustn't excite yourself.

175
00:12:54,811 --> 00:12:57,840
I think you better show the young ladies to their rooms.

176
00:12:57,853 --> 00:12:59,888
Yeah, pick us a couple without chandeliers, will ya?

177
00:12:59,888 --> 00:13:02,432
This way, please.

178
00:13:02,432 --> 00:13:04,297
Thank's, old boy.

179
00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:24,670
Look.

180
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,605
The Chinese room will be yours, Miss Richards.

181
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:30,090
Oh, you're a doll.

182
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:33,593
Well, this is just dandy.

183
00:13:33,593 --> 00:13:39,512
I traveled 7000 miles to get away from china men, and here I am with everything but a bowl of rice.

184
00:13:42,115 --> 00:13:43,960
What's that sound?

185
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,983
It's the waves, angry waves.

186
00:13:47,016 --> 00:13:52,863
Day after day, night after night, they beat with savage fury against the black rocks below.

187
00:13:52,863 --> 00:13:59,407
For twenty years, they have been, calling, calling, calling to someone who never answers.

188
00:13:59,407 --> 00:14:02,310
Just like the pot of gold program.

189
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,374
Will that be all, Miss?

190
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:05,900
No, I'm starved. You forgot we didn't have any dinner.

191
00:14:05,935 --> 00:14:07,631
Rama will bring you a tray.

192
00:14:07,686 --> 00:14:10,815
Oh anything little will do...lobster, salad, and beer, but nothing heavy.

193
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:12,463
Anything for you, Miss Carrington?

194
00:14:12,463 --> 00:14:14,281
No thank you, Rama

195
00:14:14,281 --> 00:14:16,583
I'm going to bed, Gail. I'm all in.

196
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:19,229
I'm kind of baggy myself.

197
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:21,832
-Good night Miss Richards.
-Good night.

198
00:14:21,832 --> 00:14:23,202
I hope you rest in peace.

199
00:14:23,202 --> 00:14:24,637
Thank you.

200
00:14:24,637 --> 00:14:26,877
Isn't that what they write on tombstones?

201
00:14:26,924 --> 00:14:29,825
Oh, don't be silly. Go on to bed.

202
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:31,716
Good night, darling.

203
00:14:39,388 --> 00:14:42,436
Your father had this room done especially for you.

204
00:14:42,489 --> 00:14:43,525
Lovely.

205
00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:46,275
Sorry miss, but we have no beer.

206
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:48,706
I brought you some wine. Wine?

207
00:14:48,706 --> 00:14:49,587
Why that's champagne!

208
00:14:49,587 --> 00:14:50,424
Yes, miss.

209
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:52,299
Put it down, buddy.

210
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:55,409
Will there be anything else, miss? Oh that's all, thank you.

211
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:58,924
Champagne! Why hide it?

212
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:15,603
-Ann.
-Yes?

213
00:15:15,603 --> 00:15:16,740
Is that you?

214
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,383
Yes, it's me.

215
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:20,831
Well open up, let me in.

216
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:40,627
Gee, where's the glass slipper that goes with it?

217
00:15:40,627 --> 00:15:42,227
It is nice, isn't it?

218
00:15:42,227 --> 00:15:46,683
Nice? It's heaven, compared to that Chinese torture chamber I'm in.

219
00:15:46,683 --> 00:15:49,210
Gee, what a layout!

220
00:15:50,515 --> 00:15:52,998
This is for me.

221
00:15:53,062 --> 00:15:57,183
I've always wanted to sleep in one of these covered wagons.

222
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,258
It's almost too nice to sleep in.

223
00:15:59,298 --> 00:16:03,563
What do you have to do to get a bed like this? Rub a magic lantern?

224
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,612
You really like this room, don't you?

225
00:16:05,612 --> 00:16:07,626
This is right up my alley.

226
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:11,967
Oh, to catch measles, and have to stay in a bed like this.

227
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,200
Where you goin'?

228
00:16:18,238 --> 00:16:19,384
Going to bed.

229
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:21,748
Goodnight, darling. This room is yours.

230
00:16:21,756 --> 00:16:26,107
Oh, no you don't. I wouldn't dream of letting you do anything like that.

231
00:16:26,107 --> 00:16:28,798
But it's a deal. Anything to keep out of China.

232
00:16:28,798 --> 00:16:29,789
Goodnight, Cinderella.

233
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,864
Goodnight, pal. And I do mean pal.

234
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:37,010
Say uh lock your door in case Lady Frankenstein walks in her sleep.

235
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:37,390
.

236
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:37,680
.

237
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:37,820
.

238
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:37,980
.

239
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:38,110
.

240
00:16:43,464 --> 00:16:44,729
Come in.

241
00:16:47,927 --> 00:16:49,746
Did you wish anything, doctor?

242
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,341
Are the young ladies comfortable?

243
00:16:52,377 --> 00:16:53,595
Quite.

244
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:55,776
That will be all then.

245
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:07,088
I don't mind if I do.

246
00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:21,621
China was never like this.

247
00:20:15,843 --> 00:20:22,562
<i>Cosmo Topper</i>

248
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,676
It's alright for a school boy.

249
00:21:36,676 --> 00:21:39,572
Cara, I told you repeatedly and insistently

250
00:21:39,572 --> 00:21:41,593
when I could get a word in edge wise.

251
00:21:41,621 --> 00:21:44,112
that the whole thing is no fault of mine.

252
00:21:44,112 --> 00:21:47,563
I think it's ridiculous for a man of your age to pursue young girls.

253
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,100
What will the neighbours think?

254
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,700
I didn't pursue them. They forced themselves on me.

255
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,800
Don't be absurd.

256
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,200
Imagine girls, pretty girls pawning themselves on a middle aged man.

257
00:21:58,265 --> 00:21:59,854
Why I don't think I'm paunchy.

258
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,432
Don't try to change the subject.

259
00:22:01,432 --> 00:22:04,555
At least you might have waved to me when you went by.

260
00:22:04,555 --> 00:22:09,371
I've explained that Darling. I couldn't. That girl was sitting on my lap.

261
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,937
I know she was.

262
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,679
I warn you Cosmo, if ever you do a thing like this again,

263
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:17,367
I'm going back to mama.

264
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:20,722
Of course I don't intend to do a thing like that again.

265
00:22:20,722 --> 00:22:24,773
Besides, I couldn't very well sit on her lap, could I?

266
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:28,254
Cosmo, this is hardly the time for jokes.

267
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,658
That's peculiar.

268
00:22:32,658 --> 00:22:34,393
I don't think it's so peculiar.

269
00:22:34,393 --> 00:22:36,595
After all, we've been married for twenty years.

270
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:41,462
And I have a perfect right to be treated like a wife who's been married for twenty years.

271
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,488
That's odd.

272
00:22:42,488 --> 00:22:44,303
It's not odd at all!

273
00:22:44,342 --> 00:22:47,422
Cosmo, do you realize what you're saying?

274
00:22:47,422 --> 00:22:48,652
I beg your pardon?

275
00:22:48,652 --> 00:22:50,582
Well if that is all the attention you are going to give me...

276
00:22:50,582 --> 00:22:53,512
I may as well go to bed. Good night.

277
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,800
I might be a little overweight.

278
00:22:59,856 --> 00:23:02,500
Well, I'm certainly not ponchy.

279
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,300
Actually, I'm in pretty good shape for the shape that I am.

280
00:23:05,388 --> 00:23:08,818
After all, I'm a banker, not a glamor boy.

281
00:23:39,289 --> 00:23:43,440
Get your cold feet off my back.

282
00:23:43,461 --> 00:23:46,101
You don't need all the covers, do you?

283
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:56,376
Here I am Toppy. Remember me? The girl who sat on your lap?

284
00:23:56,432 --> 00:23:58,817
Oh, this is terrible!

285
00:23:58,817 --> 00:24:00,380
What's terrible?

286
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,839
You're a ghost! You're dead!

287
00:24:02,882 --> 00:24:03,977
No kidding.

288
00:24:03,977 --> 00:24:07,291
You better get out of here. I've had enough trouble with you kind of people.

289
00:24:07,302 --> 00:24:09,462
Well, that's strange, I should be dead.

290
00:24:09,523 --> 00:24:13,516
I was young and healthy, and I felt swell when I went to bed. So why did I die?

291
00:24:13,516 --> 00:24:16,683
I don't know, but you can't stay here. You have to go back to the Carrington house.

292
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:17,606
Cosmo?

293
00:24:17,606 --> 00:24:18,657
There, you see?

294
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:19,821
Cosmo!

295
00:24:19,821 --> 00:24:21,375
Quick, do something, vanish!

296
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:24,079
Well, alrightToppy, here I go.

297
00:24:26,126 --> 00:24:27,653
Oh it's you, dear.

298
00:24:27,653 --> 00:24:29,802
Cosmo, who on Earth were you talking to?

299
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:31,150
Nobody, dear.

300
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:35,253
Nobody. I was just talking in my sleep.

301
00:24:35,253 --> 00:24:39,842
Talking in your sleep? Well, that is such a waste of time. Besides, nobody can hear you.

302
00:24:39,842 --> 00:24:42,970
Oh, well, I'm not so sure about that.

303
00:24:42,994 --> 00:24:48,544
Cosmo, I'm sorry I was so mean. I know you'd tell me if there was anything between you and that girl.

304
00:24:48,544 --> 00:24:50,386
Let's forget all about it.

305
00:24:50,386 --> 00:24:54,372
I'd like to dear, but under the circumstances, I'm afraid I can't.

306
00:24:54,396 --> 00:24:58,419
Of course, if that is the way you feel about it, I'll talk to you in the morning.

307
00:24:58,452 --> 00:25:00,012
When you're sober.

308
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,900
Why don't you look where you're going?

309
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,210
Why don't you be where you are? Now see what you've done?

310
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,519
There's nothing compared with what I'm going to do if you don't come with me.

311
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,966
Come with you? Where?

312
00:25:16,966 --> 00:25:18,470
Back to the Carrington house.

313
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,695
I'm curious to know what happened to me.

314
00:25:20,695 --> 00:25:21,801
Go ahead.

315
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:24,876
Oh no, no I couldn't go alone, I'm afraid.

316
00:25:24,876 --> 00:25:26,766
I don't like that house, it's spooky.

317
00:25:26,773 --> 00:25:28,714
I won't go!

318
00:25:28,714 --> 00:25:31,180
Alright, if that's the way you feel about it.

319
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,370
Get out of my bed.

320
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,292
I won't, not unless you come with me.

321
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:36,356
You get out of my bed or I'll tell Mrs. Topper.

322
00:25:36,356 --> 00:25:37,054
What would you tell her?

323
00:25:37,054 --> 00:25:38,807
I'll tell her you're in my bed.

324
00:25:41,215 --> 00:25:43,126
Oh no, I can't say I agree with that.

325
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:45,172
Not very well, but I can.

326
00:25:45,172 --> 00:25:48,083
Oh, but you wouldn't do that. Topper wouldn't understand.

327
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:49,369
You coming with me or not?

328
00:25:49,405 --> 00:25:50,461
I can't!

329
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:54,357
Alright then, I'll give your three to make up your mind.and then I'll scream.

330
00:25:54,357 --> 00:25:56,809
-One, two...
-No.

331
00:25:56,809 --> 00:25:58,400
Please, please don't!

332
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,500
Alright, you win. Now, what do you want me to do now?

333
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,100
Call your chauffeur and tell him to take us to the Carrington House.

334
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,400
Hello?

335
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,700
Yes, boss.

336
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,300
Well, it ain't daylight yet!

337
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,100
Oh, you know that, huh?

338
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,900
Yes sir, right away.

339
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,300
What are you gaping at?

340
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,240
Wish I knew

341
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:06,780
Oh, come on! get going

342
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,280
Yes sir

343
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:22,630
-Where to, Mr. Toppins?
-Carrington place.

344
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:28,300
Pardon me Boss, but could I sought an inquire what we're going to the Carrington place for?

345
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,050
To look for a body.

346
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:35,400
Better look for one for me too, cause' the one i'm using now is numb.

347
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,040
Come on Eddie, you wanna help me

348
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,200
-With what boss?
-With the body
-The bo...

349
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:59,480
Okay, I'll go with you but kinda keep to one side because I got a feeling some runners gonna be done

350
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,700
Toppey, that's the bedroom I was in, the one with the balcony

351
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,220
-How are we gonna get in?
-Through the window.

352
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,390
Pardon me Boss, but can I get confidential for a moment?

353
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,100
What is it?

354
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:15,950
-Do I look as pale as I feel?
-What's the matter with you?

355
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:21,360
-I don't know but there's somebody here
-Oh, come, come on

356
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,840
Give me your arm Toppy!

357
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,790
Them ain't rabbit trap!

358
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,700
Toppy, here's the window.
 -Let's see if we can get in!

359
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,540
We can't do that, we'll wake up the house owner

360
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,050
Don't argue

361
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:54,300
Here I'll give you a boost. Put your foot up.

362
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,400
-Ready?
-Yeah

363
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,800
Upsie dasie oooh

364
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,100
You oughta go on a diet.

365
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,170
Try the window

366
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,560
Now get me in.

367
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,310
-Where are you?
-Right here

368
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,890
-Is this the room?
-Yes

369
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:46,630
-Where were you?
-Well, let me see.

370
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:50,420
-Oh yeah! I was sleeping in that bed.

371
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,460
And then it seems like I got up to close the window.

372
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:58,890
There is the window, then I stared back to bed and that's all I remember

373
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:02,800
Oh my gosh, there I am!
Look right by the window!

374
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,100
This is probably horable!

375
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,470
You've been stabbed!

376
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,220
Stabbed?!

377
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,190
This is not time for champagne

378
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:24,800
Oh but Toppin, not everyday a girl is murdered.
Look at me.

379
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,040
Oh please, please, please!

380
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,380
Because this is serious, we better call the police.

381
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,170
Yes,

382
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,780
-I wanna find out who did this to me.

383
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,900
-Where's the telephone?
-Down stares.

384
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,900
.

385
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,480
Hello.

386
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,600
Operator... operator, operator!

387
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,410
-This thing is dead.
-Uhm, an epidemic

388
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:00,560
- Where are you?
 - Here I am, sweetie.

389
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,450
Can't seem to get anybody.

390
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,090
Maybe the wires have been cut.

391
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,080
I'll trace 'em.

392
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:11,940
Operator, operator!

393
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:15,020
Put down that phone.

394
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,330
Stay where you are!

395
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,860
Your phone is out of

396
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:34,410
-Who are you?
-Who? me? I'm Cosmo Topper.

397
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,130
I-I-I'm your next door neighbor.

398
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:41,620
N-n-nice place you got here.

399
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,090
Very nice. I-I-I

400
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,050
I-I just dropped in to use the phone.

401
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,300
-At 12:30 in the morning.

402
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,350
-Oh, well I must be going.

403
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,200
No...must...

404
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:01,160
-Who were you calling?
-The police. There's been a murder in here.

405
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:11,020
Don't look at me like that. I didn't kill the girl.

406
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,400
What on earth are you people doing?

407
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,330
I have found this man troweling about the house.

408
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,700
This gentleman says there's been a murder!

409
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,200
What are you talking about?

410
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,650
If you don't believe me, go and see it yourselves in the
big room at the top of the stairs.

411
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,410
Why...why that's Ann's room!

412
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,130
Come on!

413
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,610
Anne!

414
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,790
Where is she?

415
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,960
Right over there, by the window.

416
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,530
Where? there's no one here.

417
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,220
I saw it here a few minutes ago with my own eyes!

418
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,590
Father. What's the matter?

419
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,800
Anne! You're safe. You're all right.

420
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,200
Well, of course I am. Why?

421
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,100
Well, Miss Carrington, this gentlemen was just
telling us that you'd been murdered.

422
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,460
Oh, Mr. Topper! Well, what ever gave you that idea?

423
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,000
No, it's not you. It's the other girl!

424
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,160
I saw her a minute ago. Now, really, I did.

425
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,510
- Where is Gail? 
- She wasn't downstairs, was she?

426
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:25,200
Of course not. How could she be downstairs when she was murdered up here!?

427
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,100
Now, Mr. Topper. Please, control yourself.

428
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,550
I think I found something that might explain matters.

429
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:36,130
It's addressed to Miss Carrington.

430
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,140
Darling, sorry to run out on you so mysteriously,

431
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:45,100
will explain everything when I get back. Love, Gail.

432
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,100
Mr. Topper is evidently suffering from hallucinations.

433
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:52,580
Mister Topper... how older man are you?

434
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,050
46!

435
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,200
- Ah, just as I thought.
- What do you mean, "just as you thought"?

436
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,600
-Schizophrenia
-Schizophrenia nothing! I came here in my car.

437
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:10,000
-Your car?
Yes! is right outside, right now! waiting for me!

438
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:25,500
Cosmo! Cosmo! Cosmo!

439
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,900
-Edward! 
-Yes Ma'am!

440
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,800
-What in the world is wrong with you? 
-It ain't me, it's them things!

441
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,550
Thing?!

442
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:52,400
Doors closing by themselves, people talking to nothing and getting answers

443
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,700
I'm going back!

444
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,200
-Back where? 
-To Mr. Benny, ain't nothing like this ever happened there

445
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,310
Oh stop all this pittle-pattle, where's Mr. Topper?

446
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:02,400
He's over to that Carrington place.

447
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,700
- That girl again!
 - He means the one that sat in his lap?

448
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,900
I'm afraid, too. Emily, get on your clothes, we're going right over there.

449
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,470
'Scuse me Ma'am, but are you aiming to walk?

450
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,790
Well certainly not! You're going to drive us.

451
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:16,420
My my that's what I was afraid of.

452
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:20,130
-Normal? 
 -As normal as you would expect for this type of man.

453
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,260
I've lost the body, I've lost my car! If I don't get out of here very soon, I'll lose my mind!

454
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,100
What he needs more than anything else is rest.

455
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,810
When he feels better, we'll send him home in my car

456
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,300
and dear you better go to bed.

457
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,000
-Goodnight Mr. Topper 
 -Goodnight

458
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,800
Mr. Topper, Gail's disappearance has me worried.

459
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,210
Well look what he's done to me!

460
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,680
Where did you last see her?

461
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,610
She was sitting on a table in the hall and she hung my hat on a Chinaman's foot.

462
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:52,590
Just take it easy, Mr. Topper. The car will be along in a few minutes.

463
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,650
Well, do you remember me?

464
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,000
Yes, of course, but... what are you doing here?

465
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,200
Well, I hate to be commercial, lady, but somebody owes me $26.80.

466
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,000
That's right. I'm sorry. I forgot.

467
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,080
You also forgot to say goodbye.

468
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,960
That was a cute disappearing act you and your partner pulled.

469
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,630
You... You didn't by chance see her? You didn't pass her on the road?

470
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:34,010
Well, no. What is she? A sleepwalker?

471
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:36,800
I... I don't know, but... She's gone.

472
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,410
Oh? Disappeared again. Say she must have been raised in a magician's hat.

473
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:43,970
I... I'll get your money for you.

474
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,280
Well, what's the matter?

475
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,700
Anything wrong?

476
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:07,100
I hate to go up those stairs.

477
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,720
Would you mind coming with me?

478
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,080
Upstairs?

479
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,170
With you?

480
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,480
- I better come back in the morning.
- Please. Won't you come?

481
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,980
- I better come back in the morning.
- Please. Won't you come?

482
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,670
Say, are you in a jam or something?

483
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,100
Just nervous I guess.

484
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,670
Nervous? Why?

485
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:36,340
I can't explain, but... Well, things have been happening and...

486
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,600
Well, you can stop worrying, honey. Nothing's going to happen to you.

487
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,440
Come on.

488
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,980
I'd hate to pay the light bill in a joint like this.

489
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,080
Oh, this is my room.

490
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:50,710
Well... if you don't mind, euh... I'll just wait here.

491
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,300
Miss Carrington! Miss Carrington!

492
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,670
What's going on here? Who's that guy in the black coat?

493
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,600
What happened to her? Who are you?

494
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,540
- I'm the housekeeper!
- Fine way to keep house! Women screaming. Boogymen jumping out of windows!

495
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,300
If I had a house like this, I wouldn't want to keep it.

496
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,900
Miss Carrington! Miss Carrington! Miss Carrington!

497
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,120
- What's going on here?
- I just said that.

498
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,520
Who are you? And don't tell me you're this girl's rich uncle!

499
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,700
- Why don't be silly. I'm her father.
- Well, that's close enough.

500
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,090
Anne! Anne!

501
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,840
She's fainted.

502
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:23,620
I'll bet you the first thing she says when she opens her eyes is, "Where am I?"

503
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,040
What happened?

504
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,630
Say! What are you doing here?

505
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,700
All right! So, I'll explain it to you.

506
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,050
This young lady owes me for a taxi cab ride. I came here to collect it. She asked me up to this room.

507
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,430
This young lady owes me for a taxi cab ride. I came here to collect it. She asked me up to this room.

508
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:38,110
I heard and scream and walked into the middle of an Orson Wells broadcast!

509
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:41,060
- A man was standing over me with a knife.
- There it is. There!

510
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,600
- Where did you get that knife?
- Well, I found it under the window in the next room.

511
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,400
Perhaps, Topper's story was right.

512
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,020
He said they murdered the other girl. Now they've tried to murder Anne!

513
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:54,390
Braumer... call the police!

514
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:57,800
Oh, well, now, wait a minute! You don't think I had anything to do with this.

515
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,200
- Well, do you?
- Why, certainly not!

516
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,390
Anne, dear, you'd better get your clothes on.

517
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:07,580
I'm afraid you're going to remain here, young man.

518
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,870
But good heavens! Why should anybody want to kill Miss Carrington?

519
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,200
Well, they killed me, didn't they?

520
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,300
- Yes, I can understand that. But, Miss Carrington--
- Oh, don't worry about her anymore.

521
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,290
- Yes, I can understand that. But, Miss Carrington--
- Oh, don't worry about her anymore.

522
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:18,370
She's got a nice, handsome bodyguard. He's a taxi driver.

523
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:20,070
Maybe he's the one that's doing all the killing.

524
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:23,700
Nonsense! He didn't bring his cab in the house with him!

525
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,720
Well, then. If she's safe there's no reason for me to stay.

526
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,100
Good night. I've had a lovely time.

527
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:32,110
Oh, Toppy, don't run out now. We've got to find out who killed me.

528
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:34,200
Then we'll know who's threatening Anne.

529
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,690
Yes, but I don't want my wife threatening me, you see. And she will if she finds out.

530
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:40,800
- No. I'm going home.
- Oh!

531
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,220
Madam, I'm quite sure you're mistaken!

532
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,890
I'm not mistaken. I know I'm not. I'm Mrs. Topper!

533
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:51,420
- Aren't I, Edward?
- Yes, ma'am, but I don't think that's what the gentleman means.

534
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,600
I certainly do know what I mean, don't I?

535
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,000
Frankly, madam, I don't know.

536
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,680
- Well, who does?
- What do you say we start from the beginning?

537
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,040
That's a good idea. Where is my husband?

538
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,000
<i>But, madam, I don't know! This is a private home.</i>

539
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,230
Private! It looks more like a parade ground!

540
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,930
<i>Can I help you?</i>

541
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:09,380
You certainly can!

542
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,270
Do you live here?

543
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,500
Yes... I do.

544
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:16,500
I'm Mrs. Topper. I'm looking for my husband, Mr. Topper. Oh...

545
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,770
Where's that friend of yours, the one that goes around sitting on people's laps?

546
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,370
- Well, I...
- She's been murdered, according to your husband.

547
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:25,600
Don't change the subject. If you won't help us, we'll find him ourselves. Come along, Emily.

548
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,020
- I think you'll find him in the sitting room.
- The sitting room.

549
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,580
Maybe she's still sitting on his lap.

550
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,280
Sitting on his lap! Good heavens!

551
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,470
You mean you've got a room just for that? Where is it?

552
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,700
<i>Uh, right this way.</i>

553
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,690
Come along, Emily. Come along.

554
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,200
Here she comes. You've got to go.

555
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,290
I don't trust you, bunny. You'll try to run out on me.

556
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:47,500
How can I run out with her there? And how can I face her with you here?

557
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,110
Well, sounds logical. Okay, here we go.

558
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,760
[Ghost]
Come on, fella!

559
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,090
Cosmo... Cosmo!

560
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:02,900
Well? Where is he?

561
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,730
He was here a few minutes ago.

562
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:06,130
Braumer, what happened to him?

563
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:09,000
I don't know, sir. But I'm positive he hasn't left the house.

564
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,610
And he won't! Not 'til I find him and give him a piece of my mind.

565
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:13,200
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

566
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,540
Well... Where's the telephone?

567
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:17,560
- Right this way. 
- Come along, Emily.

568
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,500
Come along, Edward.

569
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:23,110
Cosmo! Cosmo! 
Cosmo!!

570
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,560
Operator? Operator, I want to report a missing husband.

571
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,400
- Edward, you look for him down that way.
- It's awful dark down there.

572
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,090
- Edward, you look for him down that way.
- It's awful dark down there.

573
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:37,000
Darkness never hurt anyone!

574
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,480
It ain't the darkness, Mrs. Topper, it's what's in it!

575
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:44,170
Don't be silly. There's no difference between light and dark... except the lights are out!

576
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:46,240
<i>Run along!</i>

577
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,840
I'll go, but... every hair on my coat is standing on end.

578
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,490
Cosmo Topper? Well, what's he look like?

579
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:59,500
Like a banker. Of course, that's because he is a banker.

580
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,910
- Well, can you describe him?
- Well, he wears a size 15 shirt with a 33 sleeve.

581
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:05,530
- Well, can you describe him?
- Well, he wears a size 15 shirt with a 33 sleeve.

582
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:09,570
...a 9 1/2 sock (lyle), and is slightly bald.

583
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:11,030
Oh, yes. There's something else.

584
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:15,080
Let me see. I paid the milkman. That lunch has been changed from Thursday to Friday...

585
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,410
Oh, yes! There's been a murder.

586
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:18,590
Murder!

587
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:20,370
Yes. Murder.

588
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:25,380
Capital M U R D E R. Murder.

589
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:30,430
Trying to make these policemen understand something is harder than doing it yourself!

590
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,570
Mr. Topper?

591
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,970
Hey, Eddie. Got a cigarette?

592
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,130
Give me a match.

593
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:33,150
Mr. Topper! Mr. Topper! 
Mr. Topper!

594
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,630
Oh, Mr. Toppeeeerrr!

595
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,630
<i>Cosmo!</i>

596
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,510
<i>Cosmo?</i>

597
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,500
<i>Cosmo, where are you?</i>

598
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:36,700
[Ghost]
Why, Toppy! What are you doing here?

599
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,210
Oh, where are you?

600
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:41,500
[Ghost]
Behind the screen... getting dressed.

601
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:47,060
[Ghost]
You little sassy-face! Didn't your ma ever tell you to knock on a lady's bedroom door before you barge in?

602
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:50,900
This is most embarrassing! Why couldn't you stay the way you were?

603
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:54,590
[Ghost]
A neglige is hardly appropriate for solving crimes.

604
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,400
Come on, Toppy. We've got things to do.

605
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,500
<i>Cosmo!</i>

606
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,460
Gotta get out of here!

607
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,280
<i>Cosmo?</i>

608
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,900
- I'm from headquarters. What's the trouble here?
- Trouble, sir?

609
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:22,200
Now, don't stand there dumb! I got a phone call about a half an hour ago that there's been a murder!

610
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,500
And maybe you did it!

611
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,290
<i>Cosmo!</i>

612
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,020
In here! Quick!

613
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,710
Cosmo!

614
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:36,750
Cosmo?

615
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,910
Oh, this must be the kitchen!

616
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:40,870
Well, it's not the music room.

617
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:43,160
Well, he's not here.

618
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,700
Cosmo? Where on Earth can he be?

619
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:53,030
<i>Cosmo?...Cosmo!</i>

620
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,430
My! It's drafty in here!

621
00:47:56,430 --> 00:48:00,860
Oh!! Look! It's a chocolate cake!
 Emily, make some tea.

622
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,300
Tea!?

623
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,470
Of course! To go with out cake.

624
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:07,790
- But what about Mr. Topper?
- Emily, you know he never drinks tea.

625
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:10,300
Well, yes, I kno...

626
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,300
This is getting awful monotonous!

627
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,570
Now, then... Did you see the face of the man who wore the cloak?

628
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:29,180
No... it... it was covered up.

629
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:31,000
Somebody's covering up a lot of things around here!

630
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,200
Well, why don't you let her alone? She's nervous and upset.

631
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,500
She is? How do you think I feel? A murder and no body!

632
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,760
Did anybody see a body?

633
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,400
Didn't you say Topper said he saw the body?

634
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,060
Cut out the double talk! Who's Topper?

635
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,750
He's the man who said he saw the body.

636
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,630
- Where is he?
- He's gone.

637
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:49,750
He... he's gone? The body's gone!

638
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,830
S-- say, what are you people trying to do to me?

639
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:54,860
I'm sure, Sergeant, it's nothing but a tempest in a teapot.

640
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:58,700
Miss Carrington had a note from the supposedly dead girl that will clear it all up.

641
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,950
- Where's the note? 
 - It's gone.

642
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:04,430
<i>The note's gone. Topper's gone.
 The body's gone!</i>

643
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:08,800
<i>Now, look here! 
</i>I don't have to come here to be made a fool of!

644
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:16,440
[Butler]
<i>Beg pardon, sir, but I believe Miss Carrington left the note upstairs.</i>

645
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,530
[Sergeant]
<i>Jim, take the boys upstairs. Search everywhere! Don't miss anything!</i>

646
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:21,300
Tear it apart!

647
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,530
Now, look here, Rebekah. Quit stalling!

648
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:26,790
- Where is this guy, Topper?
- I don't know.

649
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:29,200
- Well, what was he doing here in the first place?
- I don't know.

650
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,290
- Say, what do you think I am?!
- I don't know.

651
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:35,080
- Who's this fresh guy?
- Oh, he's all right. He's a taxi driver.

652
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,990
Yeah? Well, where's your taxi? Now, don't tell me that's disappeared, too.

653
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:40,330
Where do you think it is?

654
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:44,100
I'm not supposed to think! I'm from the city hall!

655
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,930
- Now, where was I?
- I don't know.

656
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:51,460
Emily, this cake is simply delicious!

657
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,900
- Glad you like it.
- It's the best you've ever made.

658
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:56,640
-This is not our cake.
- Oh, I forgot!

659
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,450
Get some cream, Emily, please.

660
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:01,390
Cream... Yes, ma'am.

661
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,800
- Oh, hello.
- Hush!

662
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:16,600
Emily!

663
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:21,730
Cosmo! Oh, what in the world are you doing in here?

664
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:26,500
Just... sitting dear. It's chilly outside.

665
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,500
But... but you... you never used to sit in our icebox!

666
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:34,700
Getting out of a nice warm bed to come and sit in someone's icebox! I don't understand it.

667
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,120
Oh, but I do understand it. Don't I, Emily?

668
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,490
I... I hope so.

669
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:40,890
That scream came from in here.

670
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:43,550
- Hey, look.
- A prowler!

671
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:45,810
- Who are you?
- I'm Mrs. Topper. Who are you?

672
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:47,740
Miss... Mrs. Topper!

673
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,400
- Where's your husband?
- In the icebox.

674
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,990
- Has he got the body with him? 
- Certainly. Under his overcoat.

675
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,290
So, you're Topper, huh?

676
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:03,710
Would you mind coming out of cold storage?

677
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:05,400
I will not.

678
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,260
Say, what's the matter with him? Is he icebox crazy?

679
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:10,370
- He's suffering from hallucinations.
- Oh...

680
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:13,230
You wouldn't, by any chance, be thinking you were a lamb chop?

681
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:16,350
Now, then! 
What do you mean by stealing into this house in the middle of the night?

682
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:18,540
And what have you done with that girl you had on your lap?

683
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:22,300
Girl on his lap, eh? Oho! A love triangle!

684
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,110
Oh, do you really think so, Officer?

685
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:28,590
I get it. You sneaked into here to see some gal. Your wife followed you.

686
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:31,560
You had to get rid of the dame, so you knocked her off!
 Yes or no?

687
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,580
I did not.

688
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,300
- Where's the body?
- I don't know.

689
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,150
So, you admit there is a body.

690
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:39,300
Yes! I came over here to look for it.

691
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,700
- But how did you know it was here?
- She told me.

692
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,680
She? Who's she?

693
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,600
The dead girl.

694
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,680
Well! Now, we're get--

695
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,830
Wait a minute. How could a dead person talk?

696
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:52,800
I don't know, but... this one does.

697
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,550
Oh, I mean. I know you won't believe what I'm going to tell you, but...

698
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,000
Well, we certainly won't!

699
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,270
Where were you when the attempt was made on Miss Carrington's life?

700
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:03,720
In the library, I think. I don't know.

701
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,240
Did you or did you not try to stab this young lady?

702
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,410
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Officer. Cosmo wouldn't try to stab anybody.

703
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:13,000
He can't even carve a turkey.

704
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,690
Now, listen, lady. Somebody kills a dame <i>who talks after she's dead.</i>

705
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:23,800
<i>And the body gets up and walks away. Somebody tried to whittle on this young lady.</i>

706
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,650
And I find him hiding in the icebox!

707
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:28,650
[Ghost]
- Here, Toppy. Take this!
- I don't want it.

708
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:30,310
[Mrs. Topper]
<i>You mean, you're going to arrest him?</i>

709
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:34,270
Well, these ain't exactly charm bracelets, lady.

710
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,030
He's got a gun!
 It's mine!

711
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:40,970
Cosmo! Give the man back his gun!

712
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:44,080
Don't do that!
-<i> Cosmo!</i>

713
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,400
- Corner 'em, somebody!
- Cosmo, you'll hurt yourself!

714
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,190
- Riley, you might have the sticks for this!
- Don't do that. Stop it!

715
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:51,450
It might go off!

716
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:54,220
Ah! Oh!

717
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:58,940
[Ghost]
Come on!

718
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,700
You... shouldn't do that. They'll... Cold!

719
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:14,460
Let go of me! Let go of me!

720
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:16,720
You shouldn't have made me do that!

721
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:17,760
You want to go to jail?

722
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,200
No! But we can't go on like this. My wife, the police, what do you suppose they think?

723
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,400
- They think you're guilty of housebreaking and murder!
- Yes.

724
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,460
Come on, let's find my body!

725
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:27,100
No, because after we do find it, then I <i>will</i> be accused of murdering you.

726
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,100
But I've got evidence to prove you're innocent!

727
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:32,460
- What evidence?
- This note I was supposed to have written Anne, but didn't.

728
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,460
- Who did?
- I'll tell you when we find me!

729
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:36,860
Come on!

730
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,630
You're tired? How you think I feel?

731
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:03,400
My goodness! What makes it so cold in here?

732
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,300
Bless you.

733
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,110
You and your husband!

734
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:09,900
When it comes to picking out husbands, Mrs. Topper, you certainly take the cake!

735
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,370
I only took a small piece and a little cup of tea!

736
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:14,300
That's no reason we should be locked up in here!

737
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:18,740
Look, Mrs. Topper, I'm not complaining, but... I'm a personal maid and not Admiral Burt!

738
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,240
Oh, Emily, shut up!

739
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,600
We'll all get pneumonia. Can't you break down that door?

740
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,000
It's as solid as a rock! 
[Banging]

741
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,910
- Come in.
- Quiet!

742
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:29,270
- What's that funny noise?
- It's my teeth chattering!

743
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:32,500
- Well, why don't you put 'em in your pocket?
- Eh... Who has a screwdriver?

744
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,100
You need a screwdriver to get 'em out?

745
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,300
I've got a bust hook.

746
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,410
- Where is it?
- H-home. On my dresser.

747
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:42,070
Oh, my-- Come on! Everybody look around. There ought to be something here we can use!

748
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:45,200
Well, there's nothing in this joint but frozen tomatoes and...

749
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,470
dead chickens.
- Look. Can you do something with that?

750
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:50,660
- Oh, I give up.
- May I suggest, sir, that you break the glass?

751
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:52,410
- What? 
- Break the glass.

752
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:55,040
Ok...
 Well, what good did that do?

753
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,570
He means the glass in the door, dummy!

754
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:01,820
Ok, but I think you're taking a lot of liberties.

755
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,250
Now, wait a minute. I'll take charge of this.

756
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:18,490
- Ryder, you take the upstairs and you take the downstairs.
- You take this.

757
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:20,710
Listen to me. I think someone should call the police!

758
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:25,150
Well, I'll take care of that. Check it for fingerprints.

759
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,120
- Hear that?
- Yeah.

760
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:09,440
[Ghost]
Quiet, Toppy. Don't be n-nervous.

761
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:23,590
Give me that.

762
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:26,670
Eddie! Where have you been?

763
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:28,750
Boss, that's something I'll never know.

764
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:30,910
- You still looking for a body?
- Yeah.

765
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:34,340
It was down there, but it just left.

766
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:37,330
- It left?
- It just put out to sea.

767
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:40,190
That's the truth, Boss, but I ain't going back to prove it.

768
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:42,640
Oh, yes, you are.

769
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:47,510
Yes, sir. My, my... the things I get myself into!

770
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:49,280
Come on.

771
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:34,570
Eddie, you're going to stay right here until we get back.

772
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:40,080
Yes, sir. But don't bet on it, unless you get awful good odds!

773
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:54,430
[Ghost]
 Oh, Toppy! You're terrible at rowing the boat.

774
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:57,410
[Ghost]
 Get up front and let me do the rowing.

775
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,140
[Ghost]
Here we go. Hold tight!

776
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,500
Naw, it ain't!

777
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:24,850
Yes, it is!

778
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:28,180
If you go out, I'm going with you!

779
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:30,810
[Ghost]
 Hurry. Help me up!

780
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:33,530
- Give me your hand.
- <i>Why do it the hard way?</i>

781
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:37,050
<i> Them's the orders I got from the boss and them's the orders I'm passing on to you!</i>

782
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:40,640
<i>- We're gonna do it my way! See?
- Can't a guy ask questions?</i>

783
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,730
<i> No! I say we dump her here, right where we dumped Butch and Liver Lip.</i>

784
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:46,610
<i>It's out ten miles and plenty deep.</i>

785
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:51,360
Oh, why not wrap her up in a concrete mudpack and drop her right here?

786
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,150
The tide'll take her out.

787
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:56,080
<i>That's the boss's orders and don't argue with me!</i>

788
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:59,910
<i>- Go below and get that engine started.
- Okay.</i>

789
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:13,920
Gail! Come here. Quick!

790
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,540
Here you are. Here!

791
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:20,770
Oh, dear. I look so uncomfortable!

792
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,890
Stop the engines. We've got to get off.

793
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:37,610
No. You lower the boat and... and I'll take care of them.

794
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:03,910
<i>- Get that engine running!</i>
- I had it running. It stopped.

795
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:07,360
- What stopped it?
- I don't know!

796
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:14,600
You dummy! How do you expect that engine to run with the juice turned off?

797
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:19,170
Gimme that! Go on. Get outta the way!

798
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:28,380
See? Nothin' to it!

799
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:40,120
TURN IT ON!

800
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:44,120
And leave it on!

801
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:12,100
I didn't do it. Honest, I didn't.

802
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:44,390
[Ghost]
Come on, Toppy.

803
01:02:56,650 --> 01:02:58,190
Well, what are you doing here?

804
01:02:58,190 --> 01:03:02,670
If you'd asked me that a second later, you'd have been talking to yourself!

805
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:30,330
- What have you got in that boat?
- The body.

806
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:32,380
- That does it!
- No, you don't!

807
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:35,930
- Trying to hide it, huh?
- No, no! I'm bringing it back!

808
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:40,160
Bringing it back? Well, brother, you've got a lot of questions to answer.

809
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,890
I got a hunch it ain't gon' be no quiz program!

810
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:45,910
- Joe, take 'em upstairs.
- Come on, you.

811
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:52,950
- Everybody here?
- Yes, sir. All here.

812
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:54,700
All right.

813
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:57,870
Now, get this and get it strait!

814
01:03:57,870 --> 01:04:01,970
Nobody leaves this room unless I say so!

815
01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:04,570
And you! Stop chewing that gum!

816
01:04:04,570 --> 01:04:06,720
Chewing? I ain't even breathing!

817
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,950
Not you. Her!

818
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:18,570
I'm sorry, Miss Carrington. I know this is going to be a bit unpleasant for you, but... will you mind stepping into the next room with me?

819
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:37,340
<i>Miss Carrington, I'm going to raise this sheet.</i>

820
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:40,760
<i>See if you can identify this young lady.</i>

821
01:04:57,630 --> 01:05:01,990
- How long had she been living here?
- She came here tonight with Miss Carrington.

822
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:09,340
Nice lookin' gal. Too bad she had to go so young.

823
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:13,420
She's got awful big feet, though.

824
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:18,030
Who did that? Who did that!?

825
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:20,840
Who hit me when I wasn't lookin'?

826
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:23,060
Was you in that room just now?

827
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:26,400
Not now, then or ever!

828
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,700
Well, don't tell me the joint's haunted!

829
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:33,250
Now, look. I was standing in that room, minding my own business...

830
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:38,270
Just as I say what big feet she's got, I get slapped in the kisser!

831
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,100
Who did THAT?

832
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:49,750
- Who went out that door?
- Nobody.

833
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:52,450
Now, wait a minute! Doors just don't open and shut themselves.

834
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:55,750
Yeah, but that one did!

835
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:57,250
Hey! Who went out that door?

836
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:58,500
- Yehudi.
- Who?
[Y. Menuhin. Song &amp; catchphrase "Who's Yehoodi/Yehudi?"]

837
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:02,270
- You feel better dear?
- Oh, she'd be alright if Charlie Chan'd let her alone.

838
01:06:02,270 --> 01:06:07,880
Sergeant Roberts, I don't like to interfere, but is it necessary to subject my daughter to all this?

839
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:12,240
She's terribly nervous. Won't you? Would you please let her go to her room?

840
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,150
Nobody leaves this room, not even me!

841
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:18,090
And that goes for the both of us.

842
01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:27,550
[Ghost]
 Big feet, huh? I'll match mine with his any day!

843
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:35,180
[Ghost]
Have another!

844
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:37,610
[Ghost]
Don't mind if I do!

845
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:42,140
Innocent men stay home nights. They don't hide in iceboxes.

846
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:45,280
And they don't take dead bodies on boat rides!

847
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,820
-<i> Why did you kill her?</i> 
 - I didn't.

848
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:50,440
That's only one man's opinion.

849
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:53,600
- I can prove it.
 - <i>How?</i>

850
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,750
- Leave me alone in that room for a minute. 
 - Ho, ho!

851
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,350
I am not that dumb.

852
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:02,030
Well, that's only one man's opinion, too.

853
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:05,350
Officer, let him have his way. There are no windows in the trophy room.

854
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:07,400
- Any iceboxes?
 - No

855
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,130
Alright, I'll give you three minutes.

856
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:16,940
If you're not back in this room with a 14 carat alibi, this lady's gonna make one of the most charming widows I've ever met!

857
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:20,210
Oh, thank you, Officer.

858
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:28,080
Gail! Gail, where are you?

859
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:38,060
[Ghost]
Just getting another bottle, Toppy. Be right with you. You and I will have a little drink together!

860
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:43,050
[Ghost]
- Whoops! Catch me!
- Watch out!

861
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:47,340
[Ghost]
Good boy, Toppy. You got me.

862
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:51,200
Now, you stand up and behave yourself.

863
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,080
[Ghost]
Sweety, let me mush your hair.

864
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:58,040
Stop it! Will you stop it? This is no time to be playful.

865
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,130
<i>- Where's that note?
- What note?</i>

866
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:01,880
<i>- Where's that note?
- What note?</i>

867
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,630
<i>The proof you said you had!</i>

868
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:08,450
[Ghost]
Toppy, I wanna lie down. I'm sleepy! *hic*

869
01:08:08,450 --> 01:08:12,160
You can't get sleepy now! You got me into this and you've got to get me out of it!

870
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:16,910
[Ghost]
- Give me a hand.
- Oh, dear... here. Come on.

871
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:19,740
<i>Toppy, I feel so silly! Hee, hee!</i>

872
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:21,300
<i>Quiet!</i>

873
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:24,450
[Ghost]
It's like being on a little boat in here.

874
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:26,310
Try to walk straight!

875
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:30,030
[Ghost]
Oh, look at the pretty couch!

876
01:08:30,030 --> 01:08:32,370
-There 
 -Oh

877
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:37,270
<i>Mm, this feels so good!</i>

878
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:41,140
[Ghost]
Toppy, put my feet up!

879
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,470
Gail, this is serious. Where is that note?

880
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:48,980
[Ghost]
I dunno.

881
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:51,840
Try to think what you did with it, or I'll be arrested!

882
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:57,240
[Ghost]
Put a cold town on my head, sweety, and I'll try and think.

883
01:08:58,470 --> 01:09:04,050
All right, don't, please. Uh...Try to pull yourself together, will you?

884
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:10,770
Wh-where are you?

885
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:13,000
Oh, there.

886
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:28,530
Got a little headache. Have you... got an aspirin on you?

887
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:32,380
Uh, no... but I'll get you one.

888
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:38,260
Well, that settles it.

889
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:40,990
That guy is as nutty as a candy bar!

890
01:09:40,990 --> 01:09:42,540
Send for a straitjacket!

891
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:46,040
Make it two! One for me.

892
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:49,520
Get up.

893
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:53,120
Now, where's that note?

894
01:09:56,430 --> 01:09:59,110
There it is. Down there!

895
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:06,390
- What does this prove? 
 - I didn't write it.

896
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:09,550
- Who did?
- Lillian. The housekeeper.

897
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:12,920
Here's a sample of her handwriting.

898
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:17,300
They're identical!

899
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,610
Then she must be on it.

900
01:10:19,610 --> 01:10:21,680
<i>Sit down.</i>

901
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:27,550
-You admit that you write the letter don't you? 
 -Yes

902
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:31,480
- Yes.
- And this is the note you found in the murdered girl's room?

903
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:32,860
Yes.

904
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:36,590
Then how do you account for they're both being the same handwriting?

905
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:37,770
I don't know.

906
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:42,570
<i>Listen, sister. It looks like you're all set for a first degree murder rap.</i>

907
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:45,620
<i>Of course, if you come clean, we could go a little easier on you.</i>

908
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:49,230
I wasn't alone in this! I wrote the note, but I didn't kill her!

909
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:51,580
<i>Who did?!</i>

910
01:10:57,130 --> 01:10:58,900
Come on! Who did it?

911
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:02,070
It... It was... 
[terrified screams]

912
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:05,270
<i>Turn on the lights! Quick!</i>

913
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:07,100
Come on, now! Who--

914
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:09,050
[Taxi Driver]
<i>There's a pickpocket in the joint!</i>

915
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:10,970
Whoever stole that witness, put her back!

916
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:13,510
Jim! Search the cellar! Search the icebox! Search the attic!

917
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:20,960
- Where's the attic?
- Search me! I've been in politics ten years and I've never seen anything as balled up as this is!

918
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:25,150
Darryl, guard that front door! Don't let anybody in or out!

919
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:27,330
- What's down there? 
- That's the kitchen.

920
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:30,530
If I find that dame in the icebox, I'll resign!

921
01:11:30,530 --> 01:11:32,830
And I'll drop dead!

922
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:36,200
Oh, come, come now! Brace up. Brace up!

923
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:39,500
I'd appreciate it so much if you'd stay here with my daughter.

924
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,010
I want to talk to Sergeant Roberts.

925
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:43,970
- That'll be a pleasure, sir.
- Come, come.

926
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:53,470
- NOW, I GOT YA!
- OH! You horrible man!

927
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:57,480
I see no reason for us to stay in this awful house while you go around opening and shutting doors.

928
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,910
- Quiet, ple--
- Oh, I will not be quiet!

929
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:03,780
I'm so nervous, I could scream. In fact, I think I will!

930
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:09,590
That's fun. Isn't it?

931
01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:13,250
Come on, let's do it together.

932
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:15,850
Stay here.

933
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:21,050
That sounds like my wife.

934
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:05,560
Miss Carrington! Miss Carrington! Miss Carrington!

935
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:09,690
- Well, where is she?
- She was here a second ago.

936
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:12,680
- Well, what's happened now?
- Miss Carrington's disappeared.

937
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:13,870
Well, I left her with him.

938
01:13:13,870 --> 01:13:16,520
Say, what is this? The fun house at the beach?

939
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,820
Everybody that talks to you disappears!

940
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:22,340
Now, I'm talking to you. I suppose, I'll turn up missing.

941
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:24,650
That is the best suggestion you've made tonight.

942
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:26,890
Well, that's alright.

943
01:13:26,890 --> 01:13:29,280
Don't you ever park near a fireplug!

944
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,950
- As for you--
- Officer... I- I want to go home.

945
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:37,600
I'll tell you when to go and I'll tell you where to go.

946
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,670
Sit down!

947
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:52,120
Gail! Anne has disappeared!

948
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:53,890
- Disappeared?
- Entirely.

949
01:13:53,890 --> 01:13:57,300
- Well, we've got to find her!
- Police won't let me out of their sight.

950
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:59,930
Well, they can't stop me.

951
01:14:01,390 --> 01:14:04,340
Don't go out there. Mrs. Topper's just outside.

952
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:06,420
I'll fix that.

953
01:14:14,370 --> 01:14:16,720
Well, where is she?

954
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:20,240
- W-w-where is who, dear?
- You know perfectly well who I mean.

955
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,760
- That- that girl!
- There wasn't any.

956
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:25,620
Oh, yes there was! I heard you both in that room.

957
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:28,430
Pardon me, Mrs. Topper, but it's getting kinda late.

958
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:31,210
- Can't we settle this at home?
- Edward, don't interrupt!

959
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:32,190
Yessim.

960
01:14:32,190 --> 01:14:36,160
Cosmo, I should think after twenty years of married life you wouldn't try to deceive me.

961
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:41,190
Why, I remember our honeymoon in Atlantic City. You promised me you'd never look at another woman.

962
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:43,910
Mr. Topper!

963
01:14:52,350 --> 01:14:56,180
You better keep away from me or you'll be a coat.

964
01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:29,610
Hey. [Whistle] Taxi!

965
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:48,320
Clara, please. I've had a frightful night.

966
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:51,000
Boss, wait! Don't sit in that chair!

967
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,200
Whatever you do, don't sit in that chair!

968
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,930
Edward, will you stop interrupting?

969
01:16:55,930 --> 01:16:58,590
Well, you're all wet! Is it raining out?

970
01:16:58,590 --> 01:17:01,600
Oh, but you haven't been out. Can't be raining in.

971
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,510
Well, if it has, it's all cleared up.

972
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:05,320
Clara, I can't stand much more.

973
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:10,630
Hold on, Boss. That chair is deceptive, destructible, dis-trustworthy and this is the voice of experience!

974
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:12,230
What are you talking about?

975
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:15,160
Boss, you sit in that chair and things happen. Quick!

976
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:18,370
- Oh, don't talk nonsense.
- It ain't nonsense. It's serious.

977
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:22,600
Look, Boss. I sat in that chair just like this.

978
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:25,040
Crossed my leg just like this.

979
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:29,120
Leaned back-- 
Here I go again!

980
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:32,280
Well, that's a silly way to leave the room! Why didn't he use the door?

981
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,490
Mr. Toppeeeeer!

982
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:39,620
Well, as I was saying, I'll always stand by you no matter what happens.

983
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:41,750
Clara, dear, just be quiet. Would you, please?

984
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:46,110
Well, if that's the way you feel about it, I won't say another word.

985
01:18:03,790 --> 01:18:09,510
Cosmo, what a charming idea! We should have one of these in our house for weekend guests.

986
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:11,260
Really!

987
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:15,690
Clara, for heaven's sake! Get out of there.

988
01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:28,600
Okay! You take it down this way and you go upstairs. If you find anything I'll be right here.

989
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,470
Boy, what a night!

990
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:34,550
I've never been on such a merry-go-round in my life!

991
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:41,200
Oh, I sure needed that one! Toppy, I just saw the murderer in the cellar.

992
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:45,120
- Who is he? 
- I don't know. I couldn't see his face, but he was all muffled up in a big, black cloak.

993
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:48,610
Well, whoever he is, he was in that room when the housekeeper disappeared,

994
01:18:48,610 --> 01:18:52,480
because I found a contraption in the fireplace that operates the chair she was sitting on.

995
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:55,710
- Toppy.
- What?
- We've got to make him convict himself.

996
01:18:55,710 --> 01:19:00,350
- How?
- You sit in that chair and tell them that you know who the murderer is.

997
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,910
Me? Sitting in that chair?

998
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:06,160
- But-but I'll disappear, too!
- Oh, no. Not if you keep your eye on the fireplace.

999
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:10,430
And the first one that makes a move toward it, that's the one we're after!

1000
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:15,490
You're not afraid?

1001
01:19:15,490 --> 01:19:17,970
What makes you think I'm not?

1002
01:19:17,970 --> 01:19:20,020
I simply want to tell all I know.

1003
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:23,620
Well, that shouldn't take very long. Sit down!

1004
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:28,320
Now, cut out the stalling! Who killed Gail Richards? Pick him out!

1005
01:19:32,230 --> 01:19:35,770
In the first place, the one they wanted to kill was Miss Carrington.

1006
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:38,770
<i>Well, never mind who they were after. Who dunnit?</i>

1007
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:40,940
The murderer...

1008
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:45,600
<i>Didn't know he'd killed the wrong girl.</i>

1009
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,520
When he found out, he was panicky and hid the body.

1010
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:51,680
You see, doctor, I did not have hallucinations.

1011
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:54,230
Very interesting.

1012
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,880
Say, what are you watching that fireplace for?

1013
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,990
Who do you expect? Santa Claus?

1014
01:19:58,990 --> 01:20:01,430
Come on! Who dunnit?

1015
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:04,730
The housekeeper knew. She knew too much.

1016
01:20:04,730 --> 01:20:07,220
But she wasn't the one.

1017
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:14,150
When she was about to confess, she disappeared from this very chair.

1018
01:20:14,150 --> 01:20:20,170
And the person who caused her disappearance was standing right beside this fireplace when it happened.

1019
01:20:20,170 --> 01:20:23,850
What do you say, Doc? He's looking right, straight at you.

1020
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:27,900
The man's mad. I was nowhere near the fireplace when it happened.

1021
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:30,060
I was over there.

1022
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:34,600
Braumer, you were standing here by the fireplace.

1023
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:38,570
You're mistaken, Dr. Jerris. I was standing by the library door.

1024
01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:43,930
Now, wait a minute. Who was standing by the fireplace when the housekeeper disappeared?

1025
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:47,450
Why, Father. You were there!

1026
01:20:47,450 --> 01:20:50,250
Why, yes!

1027
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:52,040
Come to think of it, I was.

1028
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:56,920
Mr. Carrington, would you mind sitting in that chair?

1029
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:59,030
Of course not.

1030
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:21,870
That's enough! Get 'em up, all of ya!

1031
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:23,820
<i>Get 'em up!</i>

1032
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:29,050
Get 'em up!

1033
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:33,450
- Father!
- Never mind that! Put your hands up, too!

1034
01:21:33,450 --> 01:21:36,600
<i>And if you've got any sense, you won't move a muscle!</i>

1035
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:40,380
You see? I told you it was him.

1036
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:46,250
Sergeant Roberts, it's been a pleasure to do business with a man of your intelligence.

1037
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:58,160
[Ghost]
Take your hands off that wheel!

1038
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:04,940
[Ghost]
Don't be a backseat driver. Sit down!

1039
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:22,070
[Ghost] 
That was a close one!

1040
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,570
[Road Under Construction]

1041
01:23:34,690 --> 01:23:38,610
[Ghost]
Hold tight! Here we go again!

1042
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:03,070
Well, it serves you right! Oh, I'd hate to be in your shoes.

1043
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:05,540
First murder and now reckless driving.

1044
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:09,000
The Recording Angel will certainly throw the book at you!

1045
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,630
Say, what are you doing here?

1046
01:25:11,630 --> 01:25:13,800
- Steady, old boy.
- I beg your pardon.

1047
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:16,360
Now. Why did you try to kill your daughter?

1048
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,380
Oh, don't be silly! I'm not Anne's father.

1049
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:23,860
- Who are you?
- I'm Walter Harburg, Carrington's partner.

1050
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:27,280
- Carrington was killed in a mine cave-in.
- So, that's it.

1051
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:31,390
Why, you ghost of a double-crossing crook! Anne must know about this!

1052
01:25:31,390 --> 01:25:34,550
- Too late now.
- Oh, no. We're stuck here until she finds out.

1053
01:25:34,550 --> 01:25:39,800
And when she knows the truth, I can go to Heaven and you can go to-- Uh, give me a pencil. Quick!

1054
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:43,030
- And a piece of paper.
- Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1055
01:25:44,090 --> 01:25:46,180
Take a letter.

1056
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:50,430
"Dear Anne, I am not your father. Period."

1057
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:07,620
Well, if he was looking for an accident he sure found it.

1058
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:11,160
This is going to cost him his driver's license. You know that, don't you?

1059
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:16,230
[Ghost]
Here, Toppy. Give this to Anne.

1060
01:26:21,070 --> 01:26:22,630
I'm sorry about your father, Miss Carrington.

1061
01:26:22,630 --> 01:26:26,710
Wait a minute. He wasn't her father. Miss Carrington, this is for you.

1062
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:36,620
- Well, what's this all about?
- Well, here. Read it. Or am I expecting too much?

1063
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:41,480
- Where did you get this note?
- It... flew into my hands.

1064
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:46,450
Notes that fly! Fathers that ain't fathers! 
Leaping chairs!

1065
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:50,440
Come on. Let's get out of here before the trees start talking!

1066
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:53,480
Edward! Edward, where are you?

1067
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:55,590
Here I am!

1068
01:26:56,860 --> 01:26:59,450
- And here I go!
- Edward, come back here!

1069
01:26:59,450 --> 01:27:02,320
Not me! From now on, I <i>used to be</i> your chauffeur!

1070
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,730
- But you've got to drive us home!
- Not in that car.

1071
01:27:04,730 --> 01:27:09,390
Enough is enough and that's what I've had a abundancy of!

1072
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:13,100
Very well. If that's the way you feel about it, Emily will drive us.

1073
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:15,890
And Cosmo, this time, I'll sit on your lap.

1074
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:17,770

Emily, do you know how to drive?

1076
01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:23,730
- No, ma'am.
- Oh, isn't it exciting?

1077
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:32,830
Thanks, Eddie. You've been a great help!

1078
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:37,350
Sorry, I had to dump you in the water, old boy.

01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:52,980
The End
