00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:29,101
You're awfully quiet tonight, Janie.

3
00:01:30,402 --> 00:01:32,300
I've been trying to think
of just the right way

4
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,101
to ask you to turn around
and go back.

5
00:01:34,102 --> 00:01:36,702
On this road?
Can't do it, sweetie.

6
00:01:36,703 --> 00:01:39,403
I mean it, Allen.
I'd like you to turn around, please.

7
00:01:40,604 --> 00:01:42,104
What's the matter, Jane?

8
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:45,305
I tried to tell you before
we left home...

9
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:48,106
I just don't like being patronized,
that's all.

10
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:50,107
I don't think I could take
another evening of it.

11
00:01:50,108 --> 00:01:53,508
Patronized? Oh, sweetheart,
Ralph is one of the nicest guys...

12
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:55,209
You know it isn't Ralph.

13
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,210
It's his diamond studded wife.

14
00:01:58,211 --> 00:01:59,711
Looking down her nose at me

15
00:01:59,712 --> 00:02:03,112
like a big ugly house up there
looks down on Hollywood.

16
00:02:04,213 --> 00:02:07,613
Please, I'm just not going.
Slow down and find a place to turn.

17
00:02:07,614 --> 00:02:09,294
Oh, Jane, you're crazy.
Alice likes you.

18
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,995
Please, Alan, I mean it.
I'm just not going.

19
00:02:24,796 --> 00:02:27,196
What are you trying to do?
Send us off the edge?

20
00:02:29,997 --> 00:02:32,497
All right, we'll turn around.

21
00:02:32,498 --> 00:02:35,098
I told them we'd be there
but we'll turn around.

22
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:46,100
That guy almost hit us.

23
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:47,901
Alan, he threw something.
It's in the back.

24
00:02:55,102 --> 00:02:57,502
- Feels like there's paper in it.
-  Paper?

25
00:02:57,503 --> 00:02:59,303
Yeah, feels like it.

26
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,304
Open it!

27
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,005
- They threw it in?
- Yes.

28
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:04,206
- Maybe it fell in.
- Alan, open it.

29
00:03:30,207 --> 00:03:31,607
Quick, Alan, get in!

30
00:03:32,308 --> 00:03:33,708
Alan, get in!

31
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:50,909
He's after us, Jane.
The bag was intended for him.

32
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,110
Jane, what are you trying to do?

33
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:20,711
We've lost him.

34
00:04:20,712 --> 00:04:23,112
Slow down, I'll take the wheel.

35
00:04:31,113 --> 00:04:33,903
You almost killed us doing it
but we got away from him.

36
00:04:33,904 --> 00:04:35,304
Now what happens?

37
00:04:35,305 --> 00:04:37,100
Hasn't it hit you yet, Alan?

38
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:39,801
The money was literally
thrown in our laps.

39
00:04:39,802 --> 00:04:42,102
No one in the world knows we have it.

40
00:04:42,103 --> 00:04:44,903
Get a hold of yourself, Jane,
will you? It's a bag of dynamite.

41
00:04:44,904 --> 00:04:47,104
That was a payoff.
Probably blackmail.

42
00:04:47,105 --> 00:04:49,105
We'll turn that bag over
to the police or the...

43
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:54,106
Don't stop, Alan.
He's almost a block behind.

44
00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:29,207
- What are you two so scared about?
- Who's scared?

45
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,508
You are. Didn't you ever
get a ticket before?

46
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:36,400
It's supposed to be
a big secret, officer.

47
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:38,301
But we're on our way
to Las Vegas.

48
00:05:38,302 --> 00:05:41,102
We're the old-fashioned kind.
We're eloping.

49
00:05:41,103 --> 00:05:43,303
You're still gonna get a ticket.

50
00:05:43,304 --> 00:05:45,254
The next time
you make a turn, signal.

51
00:05:45,255 --> 00:05:46,795
You think you can remember that?

52
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:49,496
I'm afraid my mind
wasn't on my driving.

53
00:05:49,497 --> 00:05:50,797
You're nervous, Mac.

54
00:05:50,798 --> 00:05:52,898
It's the bride
that's supposed to be jittery.

55
00:05:53,498 --> 00:05:54,598
Get going.

56
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:55,699
All right.

57
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,100
What's the matter with you, Jane?

58
00:06:00,101 --> 00:06:02,301
What were you planning
on doing with that?

59
00:06:05,802 --> 00:06:06,802
I...

60
00:06:06,803 --> 00:06:08,703
I don't know.

61
00:06:13,403 --> 00:06:16,703
You had a chance to give up
the money. Why didn't you take it?

62
00:06:17,804 --> 00:06:20,504
I was just asking myself
that same question.

63
00:06:21,805 --> 00:06:23,405
We'll take it up to the apartment.

64
00:06:23,906 --> 00:06:26,206
I wanna look at it.

65
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,407
I don't see him, Alan.

66
00:06:43,408 --> 00:06:45,700
What about Kathy?
I wonder if she came home yet.

67
00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:47,400
I think she went to a show.

68
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:48,401
Hurry.

69
00:06:56,702 --> 00:06:58,502
Just call me Dracula.

70
00:06:58,503 --> 00:07:01,143
I'm afraid you did startle us a little.

71
00:07:01,144 --> 00:07:04,244
- Did my sister come in yet, Pete?
- No, I don't think so.

72
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:08,005
Hey, uh...
You folks been away?

73
00:07:08,006 --> 00:07:12,206
Oh, no. Just some things
Mr. Palmer had in storage.

74
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,207
- Did you lock the door?
- Yes.

75
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:49,300
Well, that wasn't very smart.

76
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:51,900
It'd be a great time for Cathy
or someone to come in, now, wouldn't it?

77
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:54,401
You said you wanted
to look at it, Alan.

78
00:07:55,002 --> 00:07:56,702
Look at it.

79
00:07:56,703 --> 00:07:59,203
Fifties and twenties.

80
00:07:59,204 --> 00:08:01,604
There must be thousands here.

81
00:08:01,605 --> 00:08:04,105
Probably a hundred thousand.

82
00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:08,706
It's a lot of money.
The numbers are different.

83
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:12,507
You could make it work for us
for the rest of our lives.

84
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:16,208
Stop, Janie. If we don't report this,
it's a felony.

85
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:17,709
The same as stealing.

86
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,710
It's a blind alley.
With a big barred gate at the end.

87
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:26,911
Let's not try to use it, darling.

88
00:08:26,912 --> 00:08:29,112
Let's just hide it some place.

89
00:08:29,113 --> 00:08:31,003
And then not touch it
till we know it's safe.

90
00:08:31,004 --> 00:08:33,404
It'll never be safe.
It just won't work.

91
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:38,105
What is it, Jane?
I just don't understand you.

92
00:08:38,106 --> 00:08:39,956
I've tried to give you
everything you wanted.

93
00:08:39,957 --> 00:08:41,257
Everything I could.

94
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,500
Yes. You've given me a dozen
down payments and installments

95
00:08:43,501 --> 00:08:45,001
for the rest of our lives.

96
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:58,502
We won't touch it, Alan.
We'll simply leave it where we...

97
00:09:01,103 --> 00:09:02,203
Hide it.

98
00:09:09,404 --> 00:09:10,804
Hide it quick.

99
00:09:25,905 --> 00:09:27,805
- Hi.
- Hello, Kathy.

100
00:09:27,806 --> 00:09:29,706
Pete said you were asking about me.

101
00:09:29,707 --> 00:09:33,207
Oh, yes. Alan was wondering
if you were home.

102
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,708
Well, I am. And since you're twisting
my arm, I'll come in.

103
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,909
- Where's my dear brother?
- Oh, he'll be out in a moment.

104
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,210
How are things at the office?

105
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,300
Well, they gave my boss
a promotion the other day.

106
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:50,701
Maybe they'll get around
to giving me a raise later.

107
00:09:50,702 --> 00:09:53,302
You sound as if you're going to make
a life's work out of it.

108
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:56,103
You sound as if you haven't heard
of the man shortage.

109
00:09:56,104 --> 00:09:58,404
On second thought,
maybe you haven't.

110
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,805
- Greetings, Kathy.
- Hi.

111
00:10:02,806 --> 00:10:04,406
How are you?

112
00:10:05,507 --> 00:10:08,107
Well, don't say fine,
'cause you look awful.

113
00:10:14,908 --> 00:10:18,608
That's why I love to come here.
Everyone's so gay, so voyante.

114
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:23,459
I did get the impression from Pete

115
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,060
that you wanted to see me
about something.

116
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:28,761
Oh, we were thinking of running up
to La Mole's for a snack but...

117
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:30,662
we've changed our minds.

118
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,063
Alan doesn't feel well.

119
00:10:33,064 --> 00:10:34,364
What is it, Alan?

120
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:36,465
Oh, nothing.
It's just a headache.

121
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:42,266
Well, I hope you both
feel better in the morning.

122
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,567
Good night.

123
00:10:51,468 --> 00:10:53,468
- Good night, Jane.
- Good night, Kathy.

124
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:01,969
That did it.

125
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,670
I ought to have my head examined.

126
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:07,471
I was almost sold for a minute.

127
00:11:07,472 --> 00:11:09,300
We've got as much right to that money

128
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:12,701
as if we went into a bank
and lifted a bagful off the counter.

129
00:11:12,702 --> 00:11:15,500
My little sister drops in
and pays us a visit.

130
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:16,901
Scares us to death.

131
00:11:16,902 --> 00:11:19,602
Of course we were frightened,
because the money's right here.

132
00:11:19,603 --> 00:11:21,803
But once it's hidden
and out of our hands,

133
00:11:21,804 --> 00:11:23,404
there's nothing to be afraid of.

134
00:11:23,405 --> 00:11:25,605
- Nobody knows we have it...
- Nobody knows?

135
00:11:25,606 --> 00:11:28,506
How about that banshee
that chased us down the mountainside?

136
00:11:30,007 --> 00:11:32,087
If he can read,
he's got our license number.

137
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:34,188
He wasn't close enough
to see our license.

138
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:41,789
Listen to me, Alan.

139
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,560
I love you, darling.

140
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:46,161
And if you decide we should never
touch the money,

141
00:11:46,162 --> 00:11:47,502
we won't.

142
00:11:47,503 --> 00:11:50,403
But do we have
to make up our minds now?

143
00:11:50,404 --> 00:11:53,454
Can't we just hide it some place
where it can't be traced to us and...

144
00:11:53,455 --> 00:11:55,555
give ourselves time
to think it out?

145
00:11:55,556 --> 00:11:57,456
Please, help me hide it.

146
00:11:58,357 --> 00:12:00,457
I'll leave the rest to you.

147
00:12:01,358 --> 00:12:03,358
If you don't think
we should ever touch it...

148
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:04,999
we won't.

149
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,100
You mean that, Jane?
There'll be no more talk about it.

150
00:12:08,101 --> 00:12:09,301
No bitterness.

151
00:12:09,302 --> 00:12:10,802
I mean it, Alan.

152
00:12:13,003 --> 00:12:14,703
We'll keep it a week.

153
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,404
Last call.

154
00:12:20,405 --> 00:12:25,705
passengers to San Bernardino,
train number 42 leaves at 10:10...

155
00:12:25,706 --> 00:12:27,806
entering through gate F.

156
00:12:27,807 --> 00:12:29,407
This is the last call.

157
00:12:34,608 --> 00:12:38,808
The Union Pacific, City of Los Angeles,
train 103,

158
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:40,409
is now arriving.

159
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,710
It's done.
Everything's all right now.

160
00:12:47,711 --> 00:12:50,311
- Isn't it, darling?
- Yeah, I guess so.

161
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:51,812
Where is the ticket?

162
00:12:57,013 --> 00:12:59,513
It's all right.
It's here down in the lining.

163
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:01,314
There's a hole in the pocket.

164
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,415
It's safe there.

165
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,216
What did you say
to the man at the counter?

166
00:13:06,217 --> 00:13:08,617
I didn't say anything
to the man at the counter?

167
00:13:08,618 --> 00:13:10,518
You did. I saw you.

168
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:12,119
Oh, yes.

169
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,220
I told him I was going to the hospital

170
00:13:14,221 --> 00:13:16,221
and wouldn't be picking up the bag
for awhile.

171
00:13:16,222 --> 00:13:17,722
He said it was all right.

172
00:13:55,523 --> 00:13:57,223
Fuller, Detective Bureau.

173
00:13:57,224 --> 00:13:58,724
Yes?

174
00:13:58,725 --> 00:14:00,625
Does an Alan Palmer live here?

175
00:14:01,326 --> 00:14:03,226
Yes, my husband. He's at work.

176
00:14:03,227 --> 00:14:05,807
Well, this is just a routine check,
Mrs. Palmer.

177
00:14:05,808 --> 00:14:09,308
We have a license number but we're not
absolutely sure of the accuracy of it.

178
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:10,909
May I come in?

179
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,310
Mind if I look around a bit?

180
00:14:16,311 --> 00:14:17,311
Why?

181
00:14:17,312 --> 00:14:19,412
You haven't anything to hide,
have you?

182
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:29,213
No, I can see you haven't.

183
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:32,600
What's this all about, Mr. Fuller?

184
00:14:32,601 --> 00:14:35,201
I told you. Routine check.
I'd like to look your place over.

185
00:14:35,202 --> 00:14:36,602
Looking for what?

186
00:14:36,603 --> 00:14:38,903
I didn't bring a warrant with me,
Mrs. Palmer.

187
00:14:38,904 --> 00:14:40,804
Maybe I should go get one.

188
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:43,905
If I let you look around without one,

189
00:14:43,906 --> 00:14:46,706
will you promise to tell me
what it's all about?

190
00:14:47,407 --> 00:14:51,407
Perhaps it'll give me something interesting
to talk about at bridge tonight.

191
00:14:51,908 --> 00:14:53,908
Sure, Mrs. Palmer.

192
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:55,409
Thanks.

193
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,800
Leave them alone!
Those are presents.

194
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,301
So you've already started
spending it, huh?

195
00:16:19,802 --> 00:16:22,202
- Spending it?
- Yes, honey, spending it.

196
00:16:22,203 --> 00:16:23,703
I don't think I like that.

197
00:16:23,704 --> 00:16:26,704
I'm sorry, but you're not making sense.

198
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,945
If you were an innocent housewife

199
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:33,506
with nothing to hide but the iceman,
you'd never let me in here.

200
00:16:33,687 --> 00:16:35,200
You'd have been screaming
for that warrant.

201
00:16:35,201 --> 00:16:38,001
sending a wire to your congressman,
so let's cut the small talk.

202
00:16:38,002 --> 00:16:39,802
Where's my dough?

203
00:16:39,803 --> 00:16:43,103
- Then you're not a policeman.
- Only on my mother's side, honey.

204
00:16:43,104 --> 00:16:44,304
Where's the dough?

205
00:16:44,305 --> 00:16:47,505
Those things in my kitchen
happen to belong to my sister-in-law.

206
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,506
And I let you in because...

207
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:51,507
Well...

208
00:16:51,508 --> 00:16:54,708
housewives can get awfully
bored sometimes.

209
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:59,809
But believe me, I've no idea
what you're talking about.

210
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,510
You're too smooth, honey.
You're much too smooth.

211
00:17:04,211 --> 00:17:05,311
Where's the dough?

212
00:17:07,112 --> 00:17:08,600
Where's that money?
What did you do with it?

213
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:10,001
- We sent it to the police.
- You're a liar.

214
00:17:10,002 --> 00:17:11,352
You would have told me that
before now.

215
00:17:11,353 --> 00:17:13,453
- I was afraid to.
- You should be. It was mine.

216
00:17:18,354 --> 00:17:20,854
Why would anyone give up
that much hard cash?

217
00:17:20,855 --> 00:17:22,455
I don't get it.

218
00:17:22,656 --> 00:17:25,206
- In fact I don't believe it.
- It's the truth, I swear it is.

219
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:27,507
And I'm supposed to get up now
and walk out, is that it?

220
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:29,608
Well, maybe I will.

221
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:32,709
If you turned that money over
to the cops it'll be in the papers.

222
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,010
- If you didn't...
- It will be...

223
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,511
we sent it back last evening.

224
00:17:36,012 --> 00:17:39,212
All right.
I can wait a few more hours.

225
00:17:39,213 --> 00:17:41,313
And I doubt that you or your husband
will cry copper.

226
00:17:43,914 --> 00:17:45,814
I'm gonna buy an evening paper.

227
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,805
And there'd better be something in it
about money or I'll be around again.

228
00:17:51,306 --> 00:17:54,306
And I'm afraid I'll be awfully
peeved at you, honey.

229
00:17:56,807 --> 00:17:58,007
Bye, now.

230
00:18:19,108 --> 00:18:21,208
Alan, you're home early.

231
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:29,100
FitzSimmons called me
from the bank today.

232
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:31,501
It seems as if your checks
have started coming through.

233
00:18:31,502 --> 00:18:33,600
He thought I might like to know
that our accounts

234
00:18:33,601 --> 00:18:35,401
are down to a couple of hundred dollars.

235
00:18:36,102 --> 00:18:40,102
I was going to tell you tonight.
They were things I needed, Alan.

236
00:18:40,103 --> 00:18:42,603
$580.00 worth of necessities?

237
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:44,704
That was yesterday.
How much today?

238
00:18:44,705 --> 00:18:46,305
How much have you spent altogether?

239
00:18:47,206 --> 00:18:49,006
$790.00.

240
00:18:49,007 --> 00:18:52,207
About one tenth of one percent
of the money we have.

241
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,608
You're counting the money in the bag.

242
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:07,909
We aren't going to touch it.
Just leave it there and forget about it.

243
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,910
Now you're spending it like mad
and keeping books on it.

244
00:19:11,911 --> 00:19:13,611
Because the money's ours.

245
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:16,312
If anyone knew we had it
they would have been around by now.

246
00:19:16,313 --> 00:19:20,303
I'm sending the claim check to
the district attorney's office right now.

247
00:19:20,304 --> 00:19:22,504
- Tonight.
- Don't I have something to say about that?

248
00:19:22,905 --> 00:19:24,605
I won't let you do it.

249
00:19:24,606 --> 00:19:27,906
I'll take the money and go off
by myself before I let you give it away.

250
00:19:27,907 --> 00:19:29,707
And that's something
I won't let you do.

251
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,208
I'm in this now.
If you're caught, I'm caught.

252
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:35,109
But I wouldn't want you
to do it anyway, Jane.

253
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:38,310
The money won't buy you anything.
It'll only make you miserable and unhappy.

254
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:39,911
Let me be the judge of that.

255
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,212
Were you happy
when you married Blanchard?

256
00:19:48,413 --> 00:19:51,213
I'm sorry, Jane.
I didn't mean that.

257
00:19:53,014 --> 00:19:56,014
Jane, Jane, what's happening to us?
What's happening?

258
00:19:56,015 --> 00:19:58,155
The money sits down there
in an old leather bag...

259
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:59,999
and yet it's tearing us apart.

260
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,600
It's poison, Jane. It's changing you,
it's changing both of us.

261
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:05,601
I wish it were that simple, Alan.

262
00:20:06,802 --> 00:20:09,992
But I haven't changed.
It's the way I am.

263
00:20:09,993 --> 00:20:11,753
You've got to let me keep
that money.

264
00:20:11,754 --> 00:20:13,454
- Don't, don't, Jane...
- No, Alan.

265
00:20:13,455 --> 00:20:15,155
I won't let you just give it away.

266
00:20:15,156 --> 00:20:18,156
Chances like this
are never offered twice

267
00:20:18,157 --> 00:20:21,957
This is it. I've been waiting for it,
dreaming of it all my life.

268
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:25,558
Even when I was a kid.
And it wasn't because we were poor.

269
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,459
Not hungry poor at least.

270
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,660
I suppose in a way it was far worse.

271
00:20:30,661 --> 00:20:33,461
We were white-collar poor,
middle-class poor.

272
00:20:33,462 --> 00:20:35,562
The kind of people who can't
quite keep up with the Joneses

273
00:20:35,563 --> 00:20:37,763
and die a little every day
because they can't.

274
00:20:37,764 --> 00:20:39,564
That's why I married Blanchard.

275
00:20:39,565 --> 00:20:42,765
I married the first man who asked me
because I thought he had money.

276
00:20:44,766 --> 00:20:48,066
It's true, Alan.
And you're right.

277
00:20:48,067 --> 00:20:49,967
I wasn't happy.

278
00:20:49,968 --> 00:20:52,468
- I was almost glad when...
- Jane!

279
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:54,369
But...

280
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,770
things have changed now, Allan.

281
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,271
This is different.

282
00:20:59,272 --> 00:21:01,491
We'll be happier than we ever dreamed
we could be.

283
00:21:01,492 --> 00:21:03,192
Sure we will, Jane.

284
00:21:03,193 --> 00:21:04,893
But the money won't help.

285
00:21:04,894 --> 00:21:07,294
There'll always be Joneses
with a little more.

286
00:21:07,295 --> 00:21:10,395
The only thing worth having
is peace of mind.

287
00:21:10,396 --> 00:21:11,896
And money can't buy that.

288
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:12,897
But...

289
00:21:13,598 --> 00:21:15,398
You agreed to wait for one week.

290
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:18,299
All right, we'll wait.

291
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,100
But we're not going to keep it.

292
00:21:20,101 --> 00:21:21,900
It's almost wrecked us, sweetheart.

293
00:21:21,901 --> 00:21:25,001
But I figure it'll take more
than a hundred grand to do that.

294
00:21:25,002 --> 00:21:27,000
How about it, hm?

295
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,203
I got an idea.

296
00:21:29,804 --> 00:21:31,204
We'll go on a date.

297
00:21:31,205 --> 00:21:33,605
Not tonight. I've got to see
old man Baird tonight.

298
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:35,906
But tomorrow night we'll do
the same things

299
00:21:35,907 --> 00:21:38,107
we did on our first date, remember?

300
00:21:38,108 --> 00:21:39,908
We'll have dinner at La Mole...

301
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:41,209
then we'll go down to the lake

302
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,910
and get one of those fancy little boats
and go for a ride.

303
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:46,011
How about it?
Is it a date?

304
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:47,512
It's a date, Alan.

305
00:22:08,813 --> 00:22:10,513
You got a good lock.

306
00:22:10,514 --> 00:22:12,614
I don't usually have so much trouble.

307
00:22:12,615 --> 00:22:13,715
Did you think of knocking?

308
00:22:13,716 --> 00:22:16,016
Yeah. But then I thought
about the dull reading

309
00:22:16,017 --> 00:22:17,817
I found in the newspaper.

310
00:22:18,117 --> 00:22:20,557
Nothing at all about a bag
full of dough

311
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:22,358
turning up at Police Headquarters.

312
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:24,859
Would you care for a drink,
Mr. Fuller?

313
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,260
You know, honey,
you got quite a flare.

314
00:22:28,861 --> 00:22:31,961
I like you.
Too bad you're a chiseler.

315
00:22:33,062 --> 00:22:35,162
At the risk of seeing me
peeved at you,

316
00:22:35,163 --> 00:22:37,763
just where did you stash my cash?

317
00:22:42,163 --> 00:22:44,263
You didn't tell me
if you wanted that drink.

318
00:22:44,264 --> 00:22:46,164
You didn't tell me
where you put my dough.

319
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:47,765
I don't have your dough.

320
00:22:48,966 --> 00:22:51,466
- Let us not haggle.
- We're not going to.

321
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:53,737
My husband has the money
and two days from now

322
00:22:53,738 --> 00:22:55,638
he's going to turn it over to the police.

323
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:57,739
You don't tell me!

324
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,940
Nice story.
Better than yesterday.

325
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:05,241
I like that trick with your eyes too.

326
00:23:07,142 --> 00:23:09,742
I'm just taking my cue
like a little gentleman.

327
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:12,843
- You're taking it a little too fast
- Isn't that what you wanted?

328
00:23:14,244 --> 00:23:17,344
Did you notice where the liquor was
when you went through my kitchen?

329
00:23:17,345 --> 00:23:19,545
- Sure.
- Go make us a drink.

330
00:23:20,546 --> 00:23:22,246
Stalling, honey?

331
00:23:22,347 --> 00:23:24,447
What do I call you besides stupid?

332
00:23:25,348 --> 00:23:27,848
Stupid will do
if you don't bruise easily.

333
00:23:27,849 --> 00:23:29,649
Otherwise you might try Danny.

334
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:32,150
If you're not stalling, get to the point.

335
00:23:32,151 --> 00:23:33,951
What's on that lovely blond mind?

336
00:23:33,952 --> 00:23:37,352
I told you. My husband is going
to give the money up.

337
00:23:37,853 --> 00:23:40,653
- I don't intend to let him give it up.
- Neither do I.

338
00:23:40,654 --> 00:23:43,554
I swear if you go near him
neither one of us will ever see a cent of it.

339
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,055
I'll take my chances.

340
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,756
I'm telling you the truth now.

341
00:23:46,757 --> 00:23:49,457
You won't be able to beat it out of him
or scare it out of him.

342
00:23:50,258 --> 00:23:53,358
If I told him you were here yesterday,
the police would have the money now.

343
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,159
And I don't think I could take it
if I lost it.

344
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,400
Let's get something straight, honey.

345
00:24:01,401 --> 00:24:03,401
That's my dough you're talking about.

346
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:05,102
Only half of it.

347
00:24:05,803 --> 00:24:08,400
You haven't a chance of getting it
without my help.

348
00:24:08,401 --> 00:24:09,801
And how do you get it?

349
00:24:13,002 --> 00:24:14,602
I don't know.

350
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:16,903
I'll work out something.
I have to.

351
00:24:18,304 --> 00:24:21,204
When I think of losing it
I get deadly sick inside.

352
00:24:22,005 --> 00:24:24,605
You know?
I think you're leveling with me.

353
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,406
Maybe I'll string along.

354
00:24:31,407 --> 00:24:33,007
I'll think it over.

355
00:24:43,308 --> 00:24:45,108
I thought it over.

356
00:24:45,809 --> 00:24:48,509
- What's your name, honey?
- Jane.

357
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,210
One thing.

358
00:24:50,211 --> 00:24:52,800
When you get that dough
I've gotta be in on it.

359
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:54,201
Right at the time.

360
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:57,102
Otherwise I might make
a nuisance of myself.

361
00:24:57,103 --> 00:24:59,103
All right.
I may need your help.

362
00:24:59,104 --> 00:25:02,004
How can I get hold of you,
say about 5:00?

363
00:25:09,605 --> 00:25:11,205
Call that number.

364
00:25:24,006 --> 00:25:25,106
For your sake, beautiful,

365
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,307
I hope you're not trying
to soft soap me.

366
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:30,108
I wouldn't take kindly to it.

367
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:47,200
What's the matter with you?

368
00:25:47,201 --> 00:25:50,501
That's just to remind you, honey,
you're in a tough racket now.

369
00:26:27,202 --> 00:26:29,202
Hello?
Lady, is that you?

370
00:26:30,103 --> 00:26:31,603
I'll take that, Mac.

371
00:26:35,104 --> 00:26:36,904
- Hello?
- Danny...

372
00:26:36,905 --> 00:26:38,905
It's all worked out.
We'll get it tonight.

373
00:26:38,906 --> 00:26:40,706
But I've got to know something first.

374
00:26:40,707 --> 00:26:42,999
How do I know
you'll be fair with me?

375
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,200
Listen, this is very important.
How do I now?

376
00:26:45,801 --> 00:26:47,801
You don't.
But I'll tell you something.

377
00:26:47,802 --> 00:26:50,400
You've got ten times the chance
to get a straight deal from me...

378
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:52,501
as I've got from you.
Now what's the layout?

379
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:56,102
Well, be at Westside Park
at 9:00 tonight.

380
00:26:56,103 --> 00:26:59,103
There's a big palm tree
at the west end of the lake.

381
00:26:59,104 --> 00:27:01,204
A palm tree.
Be there.

382
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:02,955
I'll come along the shore
in one of those boats

383
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:04,506
and signal you with a flashlight.

384
00:27:04,507 --> 00:27:07,407
Be watching. I don't want
to have to do it more than once.

385
00:27:07,408 --> 00:27:10,108
Yes, yes, I'll have the money.

386
00:27:10,109 --> 00:27:13,109
Then why all the complication?
Why can't you just meet me somewhere?

387
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:16,110
I don't think I like your setup.
It sounds like a snipe hunt.

388
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:18,600
It's not a trap
or whatever you're thinking, Danny.

389
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:23,101
I had to choose a place where
you'd have to play fair with me.

390
00:27:23,602 --> 00:27:26,302
Danny!
Are you still there?

391
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,703
Yep.
All right, I'll be there.

392
00:27:30,704 --> 00:27:33,350
West end of the lake
under the palm tree, 9:00.

393
00:28:29,851 --> 00:28:32,551
Alan, let's get one of the big ones
like we used to.

394
00:28:32,552 --> 00:28:34,152
Them's for four people, lady.

395
00:28:34,153 --> 00:28:36,903
Here, the lady wants
one of the big ones.

396
00:28:37,804 --> 00:28:40,504
Like I said.
Here comes one now.

397
00:29:13,505 --> 00:29:15,999
What's the matter, sweetie?
You seem all tied up tonight.

398
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,400
There's nothing the matter.
I feel fine.

399
00:29:20,001 --> 00:29:22,101
Remember what we used to call
these rides?

400
00:29:22,102 --> 00:29:24,002
Cruises into nowhere.

401
00:29:24,903 --> 00:29:26,999
Seems a long time ago, doesn't it?

402
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,600
It was.

403
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:30,701
A long time ago.

404
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:33,402
We haven't changed a bit, Jane.
Not a bit.

405
00:29:40,503 --> 00:29:42,003
Alan, I...

406
00:29:42,504 --> 00:29:44,304
I want to go back to shore.

407
00:29:44,305 --> 00:29:46,705
Why, Jane?
We just got started.

408
00:29:46,706 --> 00:29:48,506
Please, darling, I'd like to go back.

409
00:29:49,407 --> 00:29:51,507
Something's wrong, what is it?

410
00:29:52,508 --> 00:29:53,808
Maybe you're right.

411
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:56,600
Maybe something is wrong.

412
00:29:56,901 --> 00:29:58,501
I feel...

413
00:29:58,802 --> 00:29:59,902
chilled.

414
00:30:01,203 --> 00:30:02,703
Let's go back.

415
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:08,704
Alan, let's put the claim check
in an envelope and put it in the mailbox.

416
00:30:08,705 --> 00:30:10,305
I don't want to keep it anymore.

417
00:30:11,106 --> 00:30:13,306
So that's it.
The money again.

418
00:30:13,307 --> 00:30:16,307
Look, sweetheart, let's forget it.
I have.

419
00:30:16,308 --> 00:30:18,108
Now that we're here, let's...

420
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:20,109
let's relax and have a...

421
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:23,810
Oh, doggone it, I must have left
my cigarettes at La Mole's.

422
00:30:23,811 --> 00:30:25,311
- Do you have a...
- No!

423
00:30:25,712 --> 00:30:27,892
What have you got in the bag?
It weighs a ton.

424
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:29,493
There are no cigarettes
in there, Alan.

425
00:30:47,794 --> 00:30:49,200
Did you hear something, dear?

426
00:30:49,201 --> 00:30:52,901
Uh-uh. Stop hearing things
when you kiss me.

427
00:31:28,402 --> 00:31:30,902
Your timing is late.
What's the idea...

428
00:31:32,303 --> 00:31:34,403
- What happened?
- It's Alan, my husband.

429
00:31:34,404 --> 00:31:36,504
He's dead.
Don't move, Danny.

430
00:31:39,005 --> 00:31:43,005
So that's what I heard.
A shot, not a backfire.

431
00:31:43,006 --> 00:31:45,006
Yes. And I need your help.

432
00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:48,807
Some other time.
I don't want the money that bad.

433
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,108
Will you take me back to shore
or do I swim?

434
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:55,409
If you move, I'll shoot you
and tell them you killed my husband.

435
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,610
If I go along with you
I get the gas chamber.

436
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:02,811
I wonder how good a shot you are.

437
00:32:02,812 --> 00:32:04,912
There'll be no gas chamber
for either one of us, Danny.

438
00:32:04,913 --> 00:32:07,003
They saw me get on this boat
with my husband,

439
00:32:07,004 --> 00:32:08,504
they're going to see me
get off with him.

440
00:32:08,505 --> 00:32:11,005
You'll be wearing his hat and coat.

441
00:32:11,006 --> 00:32:13,306
You've got nothing to worry about.

442
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:16,607
Until his body comes floating up.

443
00:32:16,608 --> 00:32:18,808
We're going to see that it doesn't.

444
00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:35,509
You're quite a gal, Mrs. Palmer.

445
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,310
- That's for being so sweet.
- Thanks. Come again.

446
00:33:08,311 --> 00:33:09,511
We intend to.

447
00:33:12,012 --> 00:33:14,412
- What are you going to do with it?
- Never mind.

448
00:33:14,413 --> 00:33:17,113
- Let's go quick.
- Sure, let's go get the dough.

449
00:33:17,114 --> 00:33:19,914
Listen, we're not in the clear yet.
They've got to see you.

450
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,715
They've got to think Alan
brought me home.

451
00:33:23,016 --> 00:33:26,016
I'll meet you at 11:45
at 6th and Beachway.

452
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:29,100
Then we'll go get the money.

453
00:33:29,101 --> 00:33:30,301
Where?

454
00:33:30,302 --> 00:33:33,302
Over in Monterey Canyon.
It's hidden there.

455
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:36,503
Yeah, this afternoon you said
you'd have it in the boat with you.

456
00:33:36,504 --> 00:33:38,804
You're in no position to pull
another cross-up, honey,

457
00:33:38,805 --> 00:33:39,925
you know that, don't you?

458
00:33:39,926 --> 00:33:42,526
Yes, I know it.
Danny, please hurry.

459
00:33:51,027 --> 00:33:52,127
Pete.

460
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:55,428
Mr. Palmer would like to have the car
washed tonight, could you do that?

461
00:33:55,929 --> 00:33:57,529
Sure thing, Mr. Palmer.

462
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:04,430
Oh, Alan, get me some cigarettes
while you're there, will you?

463
00:34:20,431 --> 00:34:22,831
- Did I get you up?
- No, I was reading.

464
00:34:22,832 --> 00:34:24,532
I guess I must have dozed.

465
00:34:24,533 --> 00:34:26,833
Alan's gone down to the corner
to get a bottle.

466
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:29,604
Why don't you come in
and have a nightcap with us?

467
00:34:29,605 --> 00:34:30,805
Oh, I'd love to.

468
00:34:30,806 --> 00:34:33,406
I was beginning to think you were
in rift with me or something.

469
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:34,807
I can't see why.

470
00:34:42,008 --> 00:34:44,608
You mean to say Mr. Palmer
didn't come in there at all?

471
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,709
Well, thank you.

472
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,410
I don't understand it.

473
00:34:50,411 --> 00:34:51,711
Pete says he hasn't seen him

474
00:34:51,712 --> 00:34:53,712
since he drove out of here
a half hour ago.

475
00:34:53,713 --> 00:34:56,600
And the people at the drugstore
say he hasn't been there at all.

476
00:34:56,601 --> 00:34:58,801
Well, don't worry about it.
Maybe he went over to the drive-in

477
00:34:58,802 --> 00:35:00,002
for some hamburgers.

478
00:35:00,003 --> 00:35:02,103
Yes, I suppose so.

479
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:09,704
I don't understand it.
What could have happened to him?

480
00:35:09,705 --> 00:35:12,605
It's over an hour. If nothing's happened,
why doesn't he call?

481
00:35:12,606 --> 00:35:15,306
I don't know, Jane.
Let me fix you a drink.

482
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:26,907
Will you connect me
with Police Headquarters, please.

483
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:29,208
Yes, it's an emergency.

484
00:35:29,709 --> 00:35:33,209
Hello, I'd like to check
on automobile accidents.

485
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:35,600
It's my husband.
He's missing and...

486
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:39,701
Lady, the Missing Persons Detail
closes at 5 p.m.

487
00:35:39,702 --> 00:35:42,302
You mean you can't do
anything for me tonight?

488
00:35:43,103 --> 00:35:45,203
How long has he been missing?

489
00:35:46,004 --> 00:35:48,604
Lady, we can't do anything tonight.

490
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:50,705
If he doesn't show up by tomorrow

491
00:35:50,706 --> 00:35:53,106
you come down here
and make a report in person

492
00:35:53,107 --> 00:35:54,307
and we'll go to work on it.

493
00:35:54,308 --> 00:35:56,608
Yes, ma'am, okay.

494
00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:00,609
Jane, here's your...

495
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,110
Jane, you have a whole shelf
of whisky out there.

496
00:36:06,111 --> 00:36:08,211
You told me Alan had gone out
to get a bottle.

497
00:36:08,212 --> 00:36:09,512
That's right.

498
00:36:09,513 --> 00:36:10,753
That proves it.

499
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:12,954
He never intended to go
to the drugstore at all.

500
00:36:17,855 --> 00:36:21,505
There... there's something
I haven't told you, Kathy.

501
00:36:21,506 --> 00:36:23,806
I've known it for a long time.

502
00:36:24,507 --> 00:36:26,407
Alan doesn't love me anymore.

503
00:36:26,408 --> 00:36:29,708
- He's beginning to get tired of me.
- That's ridiculous and you know it.

504
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:31,209
It's true, Kathy.

505
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:34,310
We've been quarreling a lot lately
about little unimportant things.

506
00:36:34,511 --> 00:36:38,011
I bought some clothes the other day
and it made him terribly angry.

507
00:36:38,012 --> 00:36:39,412
Please, Jane...

508
00:36:39,913 --> 00:36:41,713
Alan will be home soon.

509
00:36:41,714 --> 00:36:43,514
I think I'll go to bed now.

510
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,615
Good night.

511
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:52,416
Good night, Kathy.

512
00:37:25,517 --> 00:37:27,417
All right, tiger.

513
00:37:27,418 --> 00:37:30,118
Let's have that gun you were
waving around down at the lake...

514
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:31,819
and I'll take it butt first.

515
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,320
Danny...

516
00:37:33,321 --> 00:37:35,021
the gun was Alan's.

517
00:37:35,022 --> 00:37:38,522
It would be a bit silly of me
not to put it back where it belongs,

518
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:39,623
wouldn't it?

519
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:41,324
And you don't have a gun either.

520
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:45,325
If you did, you wouldn't be hiding it
in your pocket like that,

521
00:37:45,326 --> 00:37:46,826
would you?

522
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,527
You know what, tiger?

523
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:03,928
I didn't know they made them
beautiful as you are and as smart.

524
00:38:04,729 --> 00:38:06,529
Or as hard.

525
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:10,730
Here, you can have the gun.

526
00:38:23,531 --> 00:38:26,300
Take it easy, will you?
You're not on Sunset now.

527
00:38:26,301 --> 00:38:29,832
I can't take any chance on being
found missing, you know that.

528
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:32,533
Don't tell me you buried the dough.

529
00:38:32,534 --> 00:38:34,734
- What else?
- Almost anything else.

530
00:38:36,235 --> 00:38:38,435
Where did that money come from,
Danny?

531
00:38:38,436 --> 00:38:40,436
Why was it being paid
to you like that?

532
00:38:40,437 --> 00:38:42,607
I'll tell you when I see the dough.

533
00:38:42,608 --> 00:38:43,908
Maybe.

534
00:38:57,709 --> 00:38:59,679
I hope you're not planning
to pull a fast one on me,

535
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,280
it won't pay off.

536
00:39:01,281 --> 00:39:02,881
Don't quarrel with me, Danny.

537
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,500
We're not out of trouble
until I get back to my apartment.

538
00:39:05,501 --> 00:39:07,401
Slow down or you'll never get back.

539
00:39:07,402 --> 00:39:08,602
Look out!

540
00:39:17,403 --> 00:39:20,303
Not this time, tiger. You didn't
bury that dough and I know it.

541
00:39:20,304 --> 00:39:23,154
I'll see you some time in the daylight
and a million people around.

542
00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:25,755
Danny!
Danny, come back, the...

543
00:39:26,556 --> 00:39:28,256
The ticket's in that coat.

544
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:29,757
Danny!

545
00:40:16,558 --> 00:40:18,158
Nobody here.

546
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:20,059
Yeah. Key's in it too.

547
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,860
- Do your feet hurt?
- You kidding?

548
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:24,361
What are we waiting for?

549
00:40:45,962 --> 00:40:46,862
Hello.

550
00:40:46,863 --> 00:40:49,263
Jane?
Alan's home, isn't he?

551
00:40:49,264 --> 00:40:50,264
No.

552
00:40:50,265 --> 00:40:52,465
But I'm sure I heard the elevator.

553
00:40:52,466 --> 00:40:54,266
No one came in, Kathy.

554
00:40:54,267 --> 00:40:56,400
It must have been someone
across the hall.

555
00:40:56,401 --> 00:40:57,701
Oh...

556
00:40:58,402 --> 00:41:00,800
Well, I'm sorry I disturbed you, Jane.

557
00:41:00,999 --> 00:41:02,301
Good night.

558
00:41:24,902 --> 00:41:27,500
Like you said, honey,
this should have been put back.

559
00:41:31,601 --> 00:41:34,001
What did you do with the coat?
Alan's coat?

560
00:41:34,802 --> 00:41:37,102
- How did you get here?
- In a cab.

561
00:41:37,803 --> 00:41:39,953
You know what I mean.
How did you find me?

562
00:41:39,954 --> 00:41:42,804
I found the place where you eat.
You can guess the rest.

563
00:41:42,805 --> 00:41:45,205
What did you do with Alan's coat?

564
00:41:45,206 --> 00:41:48,106
Forget it, tiger.
I took care of the coat.

565
00:41:48,107 --> 00:41:51,207
Let's talk about the money.
Isn't that why you're here?

566
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:54,108
How? Just how
did you take care of it?

567
00:41:54,109 --> 00:41:57,109
Don't you see? If the coat turns up
in the wrong way, we're lost.

568
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,810
What did you do with it?

569
00:41:58,811 --> 00:42:02,211
Why just the coat, tiger?
Why not the hat too?

570
00:42:02,212 --> 00:42:03,812
It had his initials in it.

571
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:05,513
Yes, and the hat too.

572
00:42:05,514 --> 00:42:07,114
What did you do with them?

573
00:42:07,115 --> 00:42:10,315
Not a thing, angel.
I'll let you get rid of them.

574
00:42:10,316 --> 00:42:12,716
All I did was take the label
out of the coat

575
00:42:12,717 --> 00:42:14,917
and the hat band out of the hat.

576
00:42:19,518 --> 00:42:21,518
- You wanna take them, huh?
- Yes.

577
00:42:22,819 --> 00:42:24,219
Sit down, honey.

578
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,120
Sit down, honey.
On the bed.

579
00:42:28,121 --> 00:42:31,331
Sorry it isn't tidy. I didn't know
you were gonna drop by.

580
00:42:31,332 --> 00:42:33,732
- Please, we haven't a minute to lose.
- I know.

581
00:42:33,733 --> 00:42:36,233
All I want is time to look
the coat over.

582
00:42:36,234 --> 00:42:38,634
Time to find what's
so special about it.

583
00:42:38,635 --> 00:42:40,235
Sit down, honey.

584
00:42:53,136 --> 00:42:55,136
There's a hole in the first pocket.

585
00:42:56,537 --> 00:42:58,407
Maybe there's something
in the lining.

586
00:42:58,908 --> 00:43:00,808
Shall we look, tiger?

587
00:43:08,009 --> 00:43:10,709
Well, what do you know?

588
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:14,410
Something is in the lining, tiger.

589
00:44:41,511 --> 00:44:44,211
There's no one home.

590
00:44:44,212 --> 00:44:46,112
Well, it's hard to believe.

591
00:44:46,113 --> 00:44:48,513
Could I just touch you to make sure?

592
00:44:48,514 --> 00:44:51,000
I mean, were you looking
for anyone in particular?

593
00:44:51,501 --> 00:44:53,101
A man named Palmer.

594
00:44:53,102 --> 00:44:54,902
But I can hardly remember why.

595
00:44:54,903 --> 00:44:57,103
Are you a friend of Mr. Palmer's?

596
00:44:57,104 --> 00:45:00,204
- Are you?
- Well, I asked you first.

597
00:45:00,505 --> 00:45:02,005
We flew together in England.

598
00:45:02,006 --> 00:45:05,106
In a weak moment he asked me
to drop by if I ever got to Hollywood.

599
00:45:05,107 --> 00:45:06,407
Oh.

600
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,708
I live across the hall.
I'm Alan's sister.

601
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:14,109
I was pretty sure you weren't Jane.

602
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:15,610
Oh, you've met Jane?

603
00:45:15,611 --> 00:45:17,711
Well, I've seen pictures of her.

604
00:45:26,512 --> 00:45:28,912
Mother told me
there'd be times like this.

605
00:45:28,913 --> 00:45:31,113
- I don't know what to say.
- Well, why say anything?

606
00:45:31,114 --> 00:45:34,414
We could wait till they're gone
and I could just leave... maybe.

607
00:45:34,415 --> 00:45:35,415
They?

608
00:45:35,416 --> 00:45:36,916
Well, whoever it is we're avoiding.

609
00:45:36,917 --> 00:45:38,317
Jane, I gather.

610
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:39,818
What's it all about?

611
00:45:46,919 --> 00:45:48,419
It's Alan.
He's missing.

612
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,620
Missing? Since when?

613
00:45:50,621 --> 00:45:52,221
Last night, about 10:00.

614
00:45:59,522 --> 00:46:01,722
What did you expect to find
with your pass key?

615
00:46:01,723 --> 00:46:04,123
I suppose I had to expect
that question.

616
00:46:04,124 --> 00:46:06,254
That's why I pulled you in here.
I didn't want Jane to know...

617
00:46:06,255 --> 00:46:07,755
when you ran into me.

618
00:46:07,756 --> 00:46:09,756
I gathered that.

619
00:46:09,757 --> 00:46:11,699
I have ten days coming to me
and I looked forward

620
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,000
to going to a happy coma
in one of your beaches.

621
00:46:14,201 --> 00:46:16,501
But if there's anything I can do.

622
00:46:16,502 --> 00:46:19,402
I don't know.
I just don't know.

623
00:46:19,403 --> 00:46:20,653
Where's Jane?

624
00:46:20,654 --> 00:46:22,354
She went down
to the Missing Persons Bureau.

625
00:46:22,355 --> 00:46:23,855
She hasn't come back.

626
00:46:24,456 --> 00:46:25,956
Why the pass key?

627
00:46:25,957 --> 00:46:28,157
Why couldn't Jane know
what you were looking for?

628
00:46:29,658 --> 00:46:31,358
You didn't tell me your name.

629
00:46:34,259 --> 00:46:37,059
- Don Blake.
- You know my name?

630
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,660
Well, Alan mentioned it
a few times, but I'm not quite sure.

631
00:46:41,561 --> 00:46:42,661
Elizabeth?

632
00:46:42,662 --> 00:46:44,662
No, it's Katherine.

633
00:46:46,363 --> 00:46:47,763
I know what you're thinking.

634
00:46:48,364 --> 00:46:50,364
I can almost hear
that mind of yours churning.

635
00:46:50,965 --> 00:46:53,465
You're wondering why
I'm so eager to help.

636
00:46:53,566 --> 00:46:56,266
Or maybe you're wondering why
I'm so willing to believe the worst of Jane.

637
00:46:56,367 --> 00:46:59,867
Well, I never met Jane.

638
00:46:59,868 --> 00:47:01,668
But I never liked her either.

639
00:47:01,669 --> 00:47:04,569
You know her first husband
killed himself?

640
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:06,070
Jane had nothing to do with it.

641
00:47:06,071 --> 00:47:08,871
The man had had money once
and he just couldn't stand being broke.

642
00:47:08,872 --> 00:47:10,000
Uh-huh.

643
00:47:10,901 --> 00:47:12,501
Anyway, getting back to Alan.

644
00:47:13,202 --> 00:47:15,102
You obviously think
there's something wrong.

645
00:47:15,703 --> 00:47:17,803
And I wouldn't like to feel
I'd walked out on him.

646
00:47:17,804 --> 00:47:21,004
So, if there's anything I can do
or anything that ought to be done,

647
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,805
I'd appreciate your telling me
about it.

648
00:47:26,506 --> 00:47:27,906
All right, Mr. Blake.

649
00:47:28,107 --> 00:47:29,307
Better?

650
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:31,308
Feel like talking now?

651
00:47:32,409 --> 00:47:33,709
It's cold in here.

652
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:36,210
I'll turn on the oven.

653
00:47:41,511 --> 00:47:44,311
Maybe I shouldn't bother
to light it, huh, tiger?

654
00:47:50,112 --> 00:47:52,412
So hubby pulled a cross-up,
is that it?

655
00:47:54,613 --> 00:47:56,913
The dough is checked somewhere,
I gather.

656
00:47:56,914 --> 00:47:58,814
- Yes.
- Where?

657
00:48:02,615 --> 00:48:05,115
Is it possible to get the bag
without the ticket?

658
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:07,116
I know exactly what it looks like.

659
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:10,017
Sure. All you gotta do
is describe the content.

660
00:48:10,018 --> 00:48:12,018
Then the cops come and take you away.

661
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:15,819
The ticket's some place
in the apartment.

662
00:48:15,999 --> 00:48:17,220
I know it.

663
00:48:18,121 --> 00:48:19,821
I've got to get back.

664
00:48:21,022 --> 00:48:22,722
And I've got to have that gun.

665
00:48:22,723 --> 00:48:24,723
Sure, I'll give you the gun.

666
00:48:25,524 --> 00:48:27,924
All you gotta do is ask
and Danny gives.

667
00:48:33,025 --> 00:48:35,325
Remember the ride
we took last night, tiger?

668
00:48:36,526 --> 00:48:38,906
The money was buried up in the hill.

669
00:48:38,907 --> 00:48:41,607
You were taking me up there
to give me my half, remember?

670
00:48:43,108 --> 00:48:45,808
You were taking me up there
to kill me, tiger.

671
00:48:46,909 --> 00:48:48,509
You were gonna kill me.

672
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:50,810
And now I give you back the gun.

673
00:48:53,511 --> 00:48:56,611
Sure.
I'll give it to you.

674
00:48:58,012 --> 00:49:00,212
But first I'm gonna get
to know you better.

675
00:49:01,113 --> 00:49:03,903
I think probably some day
you will kill me.

676
00:49:05,204 --> 00:49:07,104
And I wouldn't want that to happen...

677
00:49:07,105 --> 00:49:08,505
unless we were...

678
00:49:08,906 --> 00:49:10,506
good friends.

679
00:49:17,007 --> 00:49:19,150
Go ahead, scream.
Get the cops in here.

680
00:49:19,151 --> 00:49:20,451
That's all we need.

681
00:50:00,152 --> 00:50:02,550
Where have you been, Jane?
Is there any news?

682
00:50:02,551 --> 00:50:03,551
No.

683
00:50:04,652 --> 00:50:06,052
Why aren't you at work?

684
00:50:06,053 --> 00:50:08,453
Work? With Alan just swallowed up
some place.

685
00:50:08,454 --> 00:50:10,704
- Where have you been?
- Walking, thinking,

686
00:50:10,705 --> 00:50:12,400
trying to figure this thing out.

687
00:50:12,401 --> 00:50:14,600
Jane, I thought of something
this morning.

688
00:50:14,601 --> 00:50:17,761
If Alan, just...
well, just went away, don't you...

689
00:50:17,602 --> 00:50:19,702
What do you mean
if he just went away?

690
00:50:20,203 --> 00:50:21,603
What else could have happened?

691
00:50:21,604 --> 00:50:24,004
I don't know.
Nothing seems to make any sense.

692
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,405
Does it ever?

693
00:50:26,906 --> 00:50:30,106
I thought of a way we might
be able to tell. Alan's gun.

694
00:50:31,207 --> 00:50:32,407
He loved that gun.

695
00:50:32,408 --> 00:50:34,607
 It was the only thing
he saved from his Army days.

696
00:50:34,608 --> 00:50:36,300
If he'd known he was going away,

697
00:50:36,301 --> 00:50:38,201
I think he'd have taken it
with him, don't you?

698
00:50:39,009 --> 00:50:40,909
We can easily find out.

699
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:59,310
What's the matter with you?

700
00:50:59,311 --> 00:51:00,811
Nothing, I...

701
00:51:02,012 --> 00:51:04,812
I think know who it is, Jane.
It's a friend of Alan's.

702
00:51:04,813 --> 00:51:07,513
I ran into him in the hall.
He said he'd be back.

703
00:51:17,914 --> 00:51:19,114
Are you Mrs. Palmer?

704
00:51:20,015 --> 00:51:22,315
Lieutenant Breach, Homicide Division.

705
00:51:24,016 --> 00:51:25,316
May I come in?

706
00:51:31,017 --> 00:51:33,117
You don't seem to have expected me.

707
00:51:33,618 --> 00:51:36,318
- Should I have?
- Well, didn't you report a...

708
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:40,819
Oh, my apologies, Mrs. Palmer,
I see what's wrong now.

709
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:44,020
The Missing Persons Detail is part
of the Homicide Division.

710
00:51:44,021 --> 00:51:46,121
I've been assigned to the case
you reported.

711
00:51:46,122 --> 00:51:49,622
Oh, I'm afraid you frightened me
for a minute, Lieutenant.

712
00:51:49,623 --> 00:51:51,723
I was afraid something had happened.

713
00:51:51,724 --> 00:51:53,124
I'm sorry.

714
00:51:54,525 --> 00:51:57,525
Oh, Lieutenant Breach,
my sister-in-law, Miss Palmer.

715
00:51:58,126 --> 00:51:59,726
Won't you sit down?

716
00:52:00,927 --> 00:52:03,527
I've been trying you get you
by phone, Mrs. Palmer.

717
00:52:03,528 --> 00:52:07,808
I have some information for you
you might prefer to discuss privately.

718
00:52:07,809 --> 00:52:10,609
Miss Palmer is my husband's sister.

719
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:12,210
Go ahead.

720
00:52:13,011 --> 00:52:15,111
Is there anything
you would like to add?

721
00:52:15,112 --> 00:52:17,312
Something you didn't put into
your report.

722
00:52:17,313 --> 00:52:19,213
No, not a thing.

723
00:52:21,814 --> 00:52:25,884
Mrs. Palmer, there's nothing illegal
about being missing.

724
00:52:25,885 --> 00:52:28,100
We only work on a missing person's case

725
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:30,001
if it's a juvenile or...

726
00:52:30,002 --> 00:52:34,202
if there's some evidence of foul play,
or suicide, or an accident.

727
00:52:35,003 --> 00:52:37,703
Until we get evidence that it is
something else, and it usually is,

728
00:52:37,999 --> 00:52:39,704
we don't touch it.

729
00:52:40,305 --> 00:52:42,105
So you see, Mrs. Palmer,

730
00:52:42,106 --> 00:52:45,406
it isn't exactly playing ball with us
to hold anything back.

731
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,207
Hold what back, Lieutenant?

732
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,999
The other woman, Mrs. Palmer.

733
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,300
What...

734
00:52:55,701 --> 00:52:57,401
what do you know about her?

735
00:52:57,402 --> 00:53:00,602
Well, it's the only thing
we've uncovered so far.

736
00:53:01,903 --> 00:53:03,503
A Belair resident,

737
00:53:03,504 --> 00:53:06,204
a vice-president of a furniture
plant out in Vernon,

738
00:53:06,205 --> 00:53:08,165
was pulling out of a driveway last night

739
00:53:08,166 --> 00:53:11,166
when his car, your car,
driven by a woman,

740
00:53:11,167 --> 00:53:12,967
almost crashed into him.

741
00:53:12,968 --> 00:53:16,000
A man, dressed like you described
your husband,

742
00:53:16,001 --> 00:53:18,201
same size, everything,
gets out of the car.

743
00:53:18,202 --> 00:53:20,502
I kind of believe they'd had a quarrel.

744
00:53:20,503 --> 00:53:23,903
Well, that's about all
our informant saw.

745
00:53:23,904 --> 00:53:26,904
All he did was spot the license number.

746
00:53:27,605 --> 00:53:29,805
It might have been foul play...

747
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:32,706
but I doubt it.
I suspect they passed it up.

748
00:53:34,307 --> 00:53:36,907
Do you know anything
about this woman, Mrs. Palmer?

749
00:53:37,808 --> 00:53:40,208
Not very much, I'm afraid.

750
00:53:40,209 --> 00:53:43,000
I've only seen her once or twice.

751
00:53:43,001 --> 00:53:46,501
She... she's a little taller
than I am.

752
00:53:46,502 --> 00:53:50,902
Hair a little darker.
Brown eyes, I think.

753
00:53:50,903 --> 00:53:51,903
But...

754
00:53:53,704 --> 00:53:55,704
I don't know her name
or where she lives.

755
00:53:55,705 --> 00:53:58,205
Jane, you never told me.
Why?

756
00:53:58,206 --> 00:54:00,106
Because I didn't think it meant...

757
00:54:06,807 --> 00:54:08,007
Hello?

758
00:54:09,008 --> 00:54:10,208
Yes.

759
00:54:10,209 --> 00:54:12,009
It's for you.

760
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:13,700
Oh, I told the Bureau I'd be here.

761
00:54:16,201 --> 00:54:17,101
Thank you.

762
00:54:18,202 --> 00:54:19,002
Hello?

763
00:54:19,003 --> 00:54:20,003
Yes.

764
00:54:21,604 --> 00:54:22,704
Uh-huh.

765
00:54:24,005 --> 00:54:24,999
Uh-huh.

766
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,500
Okay, thanks.
Good bye.

767
00:54:29,301 --> 00:54:31,300
I'm afraid that wraps it up.

768
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:33,500
If you really want some action
on your husband, Mrs. Palmer,

769
00:54:33,501 --> 00:54:35,601
I'd suggest you bring in
some private help.

770
00:54:35,602 --> 00:54:38,502
Your car was located
12 miles south of San Diego

771
00:54:38,503 --> 00:54:40,303
just this side of the Mexican border.

772
00:54:40,804 --> 00:54:43,804
Your husband wasn't in some kind
of trouble, was he, Mrs. Palmer?

773
00:54:43,805 --> 00:54:46,405
No... or not that I know of.

774
00:54:46,406 --> 00:54:49,506
- Are you sure it was our car?
- Yes.

775
00:54:49,507 --> 00:54:51,307
I'll see that it's sent back.

776
00:54:51,308 --> 00:54:53,708
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

777
00:54:57,309 --> 00:54:58,309
Good bye.

778
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:05,600
I know Alan wasn't seeing
another woman and so do you.

779
00:55:05,601 --> 00:55:08,201
For Alan's concern, my dear,
you're blind.

780
00:55:08,202 --> 00:55:09,802
It's time you knew it.

781
00:55:09,803 --> 00:55:11,603
Your description of this
other woman, Jane,

782
00:55:11,604 --> 00:55:13,304
it sounded very much like you.

783
00:55:13,305 --> 00:55:14,405
What do you mean by that?

784
00:55:14,406 --> 00:55:16,306
What are you trying to imply?

785
00:55:16,807 --> 00:55:18,507
I'm not quite sure.

786
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:22,508
Well, hello again!

787
00:55:22,509 --> 00:55:24,709
We seem to be colliding
in hallways, don't we?

788
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:26,110
Yes, we seem to.

789
00:55:26,111 --> 00:55:29,311
Jane, this is the man I mentioned
to you. He flew with Alan.

790
00:55:29,312 --> 00:55:31,212
Mr. Blake, my sister-in-law.

791
00:55:31,213 --> 00:55:33,213
- How do you do, Mrs. Palmer?
- How do you do?

792
00:55:33,214 --> 00:55:36,214
I'm sorry to hear about Al,
but I'm sure he'll turn up soon.

793
00:55:36,415 --> 00:55:37,815
Thank you.

794
00:55:37,816 --> 00:55:40,316
Will you excuse me, Jane.
Mr. Blake.

795
00:55:41,317 --> 00:55:43,817
Well, she seems to be a bit upset.

796
00:55:43,818 --> 00:55:45,708
Has there been some news
about Alan?

797
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:49,209
No, but they were very close,
you know?

798
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:50,310
Oh, I know.

799
00:55:50,811 --> 00:55:54,011
Did you want to see Alan
about anything special?

800
00:55:54,012 --> 00:55:56,612
Oh, no. We were just
very good friends.

801
00:55:56,613 --> 00:55:59,713
I see.
Would you like to come in?

802
00:55:59,714 --> 00:56:01,214
All right.

803
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:11,715
Kathy didn't tell me much
about you, Mr. Blake.

804
00:56:11,716 --> 00:56:15,316
- Did you know Alan well?
- Well, I thought I did.

805
00:56:15,317 --> 00:56:18,217
It would be hard to believe Al
took after some wild geese.

806
00:56:18,218 --> 00:56:20,518
He was always an advocate
of the home at heart.

807
00:56:20,519 --> 00:56:22,819
I always thought so.

808
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:25,020
- Won't you sit down?
- All right.

809
00:56:28,821 --> 00:56:30,921
Uh...
Go ahead.

810
00:56:30,922 --> 00:56:33,400
Well, I was about to say I'm here
on a vacation and...

811
00:56:33,401 --> 00:56:35,301
I was wondering if I might help
in any way.

812
00:56:35,302 --> 00:56:38,202
I think the police are doing all
that can be done.

813
00:56:39,003 --> 00:56:41,400
What did Alan usually call you,
Mr. Blake?

814
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:42,501
Don.

815
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,602
When there were ladies present.

816
00:56:45,403 --> 00:56:47,403
Which wasn't often, I hope.

817
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,504
What squadron were you flying with?

818
00:56:49,805 --> 00:56:51,805
Same as Alan's, Mrs. Palmer.

819
00:56:51,806 --> 00:56:54,106
Wouldn't you rather call me Jane?

820
00:56:54,707 --> 00:56:55,907
All right.

821
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:59,708
- Would you like a drink?
- I didn't think it was that noticeable.

822
00:56:59,709 --> 00:57:01,809
- What?
- The thirsty look.

823
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:03,310
Come on, let me help you.

824
00:57:03,311 --> 00:57:04,511
Or let me watch.

825
00:57:04,912 --> 00:57:07,112
Where were you stationed
in England?

826
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,503
- Don't you know?
- Of course. I keep forgetting.

827
00:57:12,504 --> 00:57:14,800
Stonehurst, or something
like that, wasn't it?

828
00:57:14,801 --> 00:57:16,701
Yeah, something like that.

829
00:57:16,702 --> 00:57:20,502
Ipswich. I didn't know we had
any operations in Stonehurst.

830
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:23,803
Well, all those places in England
used to sound alike to me.

831
00:57:35,004 --> 00:57:37,804
I seem to worry you,
Mrs. Palmer. Why?

832
00:57:37,999 --> 00:57:39,805
Why do you say that?

833
00:57:39,806 --> 00:57:41,406
Oh, I don't know, I...

834
00:57:41,907 --> 00:57:44,007
I sense a third degree
to this conversation.

835
00:57:44,008 --> 00:57:45,608
Could I be wrong?

836
00:57:46,409 --> 00:57:48,209
Yes, you're wrong.

837
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:50,510
I'm just curious about you,
Mr. Blake.

838
00:57:51,711 --> 00:57:53,800
No, you don't worry me.

839
00:57:53,801 --> 00:57:57,201
But it's possible you're beginning
to intrigue me.

840
00:57:57,602 --> 00:57:58,902
Oh...

841
00:57:58,903 --> 00:58:01,503
That's why you were sure
Al isn't coming back, huh?

842
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:05,204
You made quite a bit about
that remark of mine, didn't you?

843
00:58:05,205 --> 00:58:08,105
Why, do you think I made any more
out of it than I found there?

844
00:58:08,106 --> 00:58:10,806
I'm afraid you did.

845
00:58:10,807 --> 00:58:13,907
If I should hear from Alan,
where can he get in touch with you?

846
00:58:16,108 --> 00:58:17,808
I'm staying at the Bela Vista Hotel.

847
00:58:18,509 --> 00:58:20,209
Oh, by the way, uh...

848
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:23,110
on my way out shall I take the guy
in the plaid suit off your back?

849
00:58:23,111 --> 00:58:24,801
What did you say?

850
00:58:24,802 --> 00:58:27,502
Looks a little pale.
I think I can handle him all right.

851
00:58:27,503 --> 00:58:28,703
What are you talking about?

852
00:58:29,104 --> 00:58:30,604
The guy in the plaid suit.

853
00:58:30,605 --> 00:58:32,555
He was lurking around
the dark end of the hall

854
00:58:32,556 --> 00:58:34,556
making like a tenant
trying to find a key.

855
00:58:34,557 --> 00:58:37,457
I watched him for a while
as I got off the elevator.

856
00:58:37,458 --> 00:58:40,258
- It made him nervous.
- He must be from the police.

857
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,659
Sure!

858
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:45,060
That's right. They're looking for Al.

859
00:58:45,661 --> 00:58:48,561
They probably figured the best place
to find him is where he lives.

860
00:58:58,462 --> 00:59:00,162
Thanks for the drink.

861
00:59:11,963 --> 00:59:13,363
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

862
00:59:17,264 --> 00:59:18,964
How did you make out with Jane?

863
00:59:18,965 --> 00:59:20,565
She's crazy about me.

864
00:59:20,566 --> 00:59:22,166
Do you know where
they went last night?

865
00:59:22,167 --> 00:59:24,367
- Before Alan disappeared?
- Yes?

866
00:59:25,068 --> 00:59:27,168
Do you happen to have
any pictures around of Jane and Alan?

867
00:59:27,169 --> 00:59:28,709
Why yes, why?

868
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:31,310
The police won't do anything
until they're convinced something's wrong.

869
00:59:31,311 --> 00:59:33,801
We're going to find
something to convince them.

870
00:59:33,802 --> 00:59:36,500
How did you know that
about the police? Did Jane...

871
00:59:36,501 --> 00:59:39,501
Get into your coat, Miss Palmer, honey.
We're going sleuthing.

872
00:59:52,702 --> 00:59:53,900
Waiting for a boat, mister?

873
00:59:53,901 --> 00:59:56,801
Not right now, but I would like
to ask you a couple of questions.

874
00:59:56,802 --> 00:59:58,402
Look, I don't know
what makes them run, mister.

875
00:59:58,403 --> 01:00:00,203
I ain't no good with motors.

876
01:00:00,204 --> 01:00:02,104
Well, maybe you're good with faces.

877
01:00:02,605 --> 01:00:04,405
Remember the last time
you saw him?

878
01:00:06,006 --> 01:00:09,606
Yeah, I've seen him,
but I'll be darned if I remember when.

879
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:11,407
Maybe this will help.

880
01:00:13,008 --> 01:00:16,108
Yeah, last night.
They was here last night.

881
01:00:16,609 --> 01:00:18,209
Hey, you a cop?

882
01:00:19,109 --> 01:00:20,709
Do I look like one?

883
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:22,410
I never seen any that did.

884
01:00:22,411 --> 01:00:24,311
I just happen to be a friend of his.

885
01:00:24,312 --> 01:00:27,112
And he disappeared last night.

886
01:00:27,613 --> 01:00:29,913
Do you remember anything
about them, how they behaved?

887
01:00:29,914 --> 01:00:31,514
Like they were quarreling,
or anything?

888
01:00:31,515 --> 01:00:33,715
Oh, they acted like any corny people.

889
01:00:46,016 --> 01:00:47,316
Here you are, buddy.

890
01:00:47,317 --> 01:00:48,517
Thanks very much.

891
01:00:48,518 --> 01:00:50,718
Are you sure there isn't
anything else you can tell us?

892
01:00:50,719 --> 01:00:52,919
They were pretty fast
with a buck too.

893
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,000
He gave me one
to get one of the big boats...

894
01:00:55,001 --> 01:00:56,401
When they came back she gave...

895
01:00:57,202 --> 01:01:00,202
Hey, I just thought of something.
She paid.

896
01:01:00,203 --> 01:01:02,503
He helped her out of the boat,
real polite like...

897
01:01:02,504 --> 01:01:05,004
he goes upstairs and she goes
over there and pays.

898
01:01:05,005 --> 01:01:08,905
- Hm, some guy.
- Well, they're married, you know.

899
01:01:08,906 --> 01:01:10,706
Oh, that explains everything.

900
01:01:11,707 --> 01:01:12,607
Thanks.

901
01:01:13,108 --> 01:01:15,700
You know, a man usually
pays for things

902
01:01:15,701 --> 01:01:17,701
even when he's married with a girl.

903
01:01:17,809 --> 01:01:21,009
Uh, did Alan happen to be
an exception to that rule?

904
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,610
He is rather absent-minded,
you must have noted that.

905
01:01:24,011 --> 01:01:26,511
Oh, sure, that's right.

906
01:01:33,512 --> 01:01:35,712
Well, I think we'd better
say good night here.

907
01:01:35,713 --> 01:01:38,813
I think it's better if Jane
doesn't see us together too much.

908
01:01:38,814 --> 01:01:40,214
All right.

909
01:01:41,415 --> 01:01:45,715
Well, I sort of made you saying good night
sound like quite a project, didn't I?

910
01:01:45,716 --> 01:01:47,416
Yes, I thought so.

911
01:01:50,317 --> 01:01:52,417
Oh, ten days in town.

912
01:01:54,418 --> 01:01:57,018
I don't think you'd go
for that kind of a deal, would you?

913
01:01:58,519 --> 01:01:59,819
I might.

914
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,620
But I see what you mean.

915
01:02:08,021 --> 01:02:09,621
Good night, Miss Palmer, honey.

916
01:02:11,522 --> 01:02:13,722
Did you really fly with Alan?

917
01:02:14,223 --> 01:02:16,623
Hey, what kind of a question is that?

918
01:02:16,624 --> 01:02:17,924
An honest one.

919
01:02:17,925 --> 01:02:20,125
I hope you'll give me
an honest answer.

920
01:02:21,126 --> 01:02:24,226
You seem so terribly concerned
about what happened to Alan.

921
01:02:24,227 --> 01:02:27,127
Yet you never talk about him
as though you really knew him.

922
01:02:29,128 --> 01:02:33,128
Well, uh...
maybe there's a reason, Kate.

923
01:02:33,729 --> 01:02:35,979
Maybe I'm afraid if I did,

924
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:38,380
I'd be talking about him
in the past tense.

925
01:02:38,381 --> 01:02:40,781
- Why do you say that?
- Oh, I don't know.

926
01:02:42,082 --> 01:02:44,682
It's just a peculiar feeling I've had.

927
01:02:45,783 --> 01:02:47,283
About Jane.

928
01:02:47,984 --> 01:02:50,284
Now look.  Let's get
squared away on her first.

929
01:02:51,085 --> 01:02:54,085
And then I'll talk about myself
till you cry uncle.

930
01:02:54,386 --> 01:02:57,586
- You know, I'm one of my favorite topics.
- All right, Don.

931
01:02:57,999 --> 01:02:59,999
- Good night.
- Wait, wait.

932
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,300
There's just one other thing.

933
01:03:02,801 --> 01:03:05,401
There's something going on here,
Kathy, and it's not very pretty.

934
01:03:05,999 --> 01:03:09,502
Don't ask me what it is
or why I think so, but...

935
01:03:11,603 --> 01:03:13,403
Bear with me, Kate, will you?

936
01:03:15,304 --> 01:03:17,504
I have to trust someone, Don.

937
01:03:18,205 --> 01:03:19,905
I'd like it to be you.

938
01:03:26,406 --> 01:03:27,906
Good night, Don.

939
01:03:29,007 --> 01:03:30,607
Good night, Kathy.

940
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:08,708
Who is it?

941
01:04:08,709 --> 01:04:12,009
You really want me to answer that?
Right out here in front of...

942
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:17,110
You're drunk.

943
01:04:17,111 --> 01:04:19,411
It takes one to spot one.

944
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:28,012
Did you get it?

945
01:04:28,013 --> 01:04:29,513
The best, duchess.

946
01:04:29,514 --> 01:04:31,900
Nothing but the best for you,
duchess.

947
01:04:32,701 --> 01:04:35,301
I say let's kill these people in style.

948
01:04:37,102 --> 01:04:39,902
There's enough there
to kill most of the people you don't like.

949
01:04:41,003 --> 01:04:45,303
Now, let me hold that little bottle
while you go fix me a drink.

950
01:04:45,304 --> 01:04:46,704
You've had enough to drink.

951
01:04:46,705 --> 01:04:48,705
Get out of here and get yourself sober.

952
01:04:48,706 --> 01:04:50,606
I don't like you this way.

953
01:04:50,607 --> 01:04:53,507
You know what the man said
who sold me this?

954
01:04:54,008 --> 01:04:58,108
He said I didn't look like the type of guy
he's used to dealing with.

955
01:04:58,809 --> 01:05:00,709
I looked him right in the eye.

956
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:04,610
And I said, you mean
I don't look like a killer, huh?'

957
01:05:04,611 --> 01:05:06,411
You know what he said?

958
01:05:07,012 --> 01:05:09,312
He said, 'No, you don't.'

959
01:05:14,913 --> 01:05:16,813
I wonder what he would have said

960
01:05:17,214 --> 01:05:20,114
if you'd bought the stuff, tiger.

961
01:06:05,015 --> 01:06:06,515
- Hi.
- Hi.

962
01:06:07,616 --> 01:06:09,316
Well...

963
01:06:10,117 --> 01:06:12,317
How did you know I was gonna
ask you out to dinner?

964
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:15,118
- I didn't.
- Well then, why do you look so nice?

965
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:17,119
Well, thank you, sir,
I just got home from work...

966
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,620
I look a fright and you know it.

967
01:06:18,621 --> 01:06:21,421
Oh, sure you do.
I know just the best place for us.

968
01:06:21,422 --> 01:06:23,322
All the best frights go there.

969
01:06:23,723 --> 01:06:26,123
And I was going to settle
for a glass of milk.

970
01:06:26,124 --> 01:06:27,924
Oh, no, it'll keep.

971
01:06:27,925 --> 01:06:30,125
You go ahead. I'll put it
in the refrigerator.

972
01:06:57,426 --> 01:07:01,126
Don, after dinner I'd like you
to take me down to the Union Station.

973
01:07:01,127 --> 01:07:04,027
Kind of sudden, isn't it?
Planning to be gone long?

974
01:07:04,028 --> 01:07:07,028
I found...
I found this yesterday.

975
01:07:07,029 --> 01:07:09,329
It was hidden in the drawer
where Alan keeps his gun.

976
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:12,030
What do you mean after dinner?

977
01:07:12,031 --> 01:07:13,999
Maybe this is the answer.

978
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,700
Oh, I was just about to knock.

979
01:07:19,701 --> 01:07:21,001
What did you want, Jane?

980
01:07:21,002 --> 01:07:24,002
As a matter of fact, I wanted
to get a hold of you, Mr. Blake.

981
01:07:24,003 --> 01:07:26,603
There's someone in my apartment
I'd like you to meet.

982
01:07:26,604 --> 01:07:29,304
A man named Sharber.

983
01:07:30,005 --> 01:07:31,661
Well, maybe some other time,
Mrs. Palmer.

984
01:07:31,662 --> 01:07:33,362
There won't be another time.

985
01:07:33,363 --> 01:07:35,563
I'm leaving tomorrow, perhaps soon.

986
01:07:35,564 --> 01:07:37,564
- Jane, did you hear from Alan?
- No.

987
01:07:38,065 --> 01:07:39,865
They brought the car back today.

988
01:07:40,066 --> 01:07:42,866
I found a note in it from Alan.

989
01:07:43,467 --> 01:07:46,067
He's somewhere in Mexico
and I intend to find him.

990
01:07:46,068 --> 01:07:47,768
May I see it?
What did he say?

991
01:07:47,769 --> 01:07:51,269
It was rather personal, Kathy, he...

992
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:53,270
He asked me to forgive him...

993
01:07:53,771 --> 01:07:56,371
and told me a could do
whatever I wanted with his things.

994
01:07:56,999 --> 01:07:59,172
- That's all?
- That's all.

995
01:07:59,973 --> 01:08:03,173
Won't you come, Mr. Blake?
It's only for a minute.

996
01:08:04,574 --> 01:08:05,474
All right.

997
01:08:25,775 --> 01:08:27,905
You two don't seem
to know each other.

998
01:08:28,706 --> 01:08:29,906
Should we?

999
01:08:29,907 --> 01:08:32,407
Mr. Sharber, this is Don Blake.

1000
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:35,308
He was stationed
with you and Alan at Ipswich,

1001
01:08:35,309 --> 01:08:37,009
He said.

1002
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:39,770
I say that to all the girls.
Let's go, Kate.

1003
01:08:39,771 --> 01:08:42,501
You never flew at Ipswich,
what are you trying to pull?

1004
01:08:43,002 --> 01:08:44,702
Not a thing, Mac.

1005
01:08:45,303 --> 01:08:47,403
I'm leaving, Kathy.
I'd like to have you come along with me.

1006
01:08:47,404 --> 01:08:51,104
No. And I'd like what I gave you
a minute ago.

1007
01:08:52,005 --> 01:08:54,405
Let's talk about it outside.

1008
01:08:54,406 --> 01:08:57,306
I've already kept you
too long, Mr. Sharber.

1009
01:08:57,307 --> 01:08:59,407
I've found out
what I wanted to know.

1010
01:09:00,108 --> 01:09:01,500
Are you sure you're all right?

1011
01:09:01,501 --> 01:09:04,301
Quite all right.
Good night, Mr. Sharber.

1012
01:09:04,302 --> 01:09:05,702
- Good night.
- Thank you.

1013
01:09:13,003 --> 01:09:14,803
And now I'll take that ticket,
please.

1014
01:09:16,304 --> 01:09:18,904
The ticket belongs to me,
Mr. Blake.

1015
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:21,605
If I have to shoot you to get it,
I'll be quite within my right.

1016
01:09:22,106 --> 01:09:24,406
I'm afraid you won't be.

1017
01:09:25,307 --> 01:09:27,107
You can have your ticket.

1018
01:09:27,108 --> 01:09:30,008
All you have to do is reach
into my pocket and take it.

1019
01:09:44,009 --> 01:09:45,309
Turn around.

1020
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:58,110
Get me the Hollywood Police.
Quick, it's an emergency.

1021
01:09:58,811 --> 01:10:00,711
Hello, I'm calling
from the Château Michel,

1022
01:10:00,712 --> 01:10:02,812
you've got to send someone
up here quickly.

1023
01:10:03,413 --> 01:10:05,213
514, hurry.

1024
01:10:05,214 --> 01:10:07,914
Katherine Palmer, hurry!

1025
01:10:40,015 --> 01:10:42,115
Doctor Adams, Katherine Palmer.

1026
01:10:42,116 --> 01:10:44,316
Could you come up to 514
right away?

1027
01:10:49,217 --> 01:10:51,217
Hollywood Police, emergency.

1028
01:10:52,218 --> 01:10:54,118
This is Katherine Palmer again.

1029
01:10:54,119 --> 01:10:56,719
You've got to send a patrol car
to Union Station.

1030
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,220
A woman will try
to claim something there.

1031
01:11:01,001 --> 01:11:03,721
The Union Pacific, City of Los Angeles,

1032
01:11:03,722 --> 01:11:07,022
train 103 is now arriving.

1033
01:11:21,823 --> 01:11:24,223
Union Pacific train number 1

1034
01:11:24,224 --> 01:11:25,524
is now arriving.

1035
01:11:41,023 --> 01:11:43,123
- Hello.
- Hell-o!

1036
01:11:43,124 --> 01:11:46,224
- You by yourself.
- Not anymore, if I can help it.

1037
01:11:46,225 --> 01:11:47,225
How'd you like to...

1038
01:11:47,226 --> 01:11:50,226
How'd you like to do a lady
a big favor and earn 5 dollars?

1039
01:11:50,227 --> 01:11:52,227
What kind of a favor?

1040
01:11:52,228 --> 01:11:55,428
My ex-boyfriend is over there
waiting for me to claim my bag.

1041
01:11:55,429 --> 01:11:57,829
If you get it for me,
I can avoid him.

1042
01:11:57,830 --> 01:12:02,430
If you like, I'll let you spend
the 5 dollars on me.

1043
01:12:02,431 --> 01:12:04,631
Well, what are we waiting for?

1044
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:01,032
- Here I am.
- I'll take my fin now, lady.

1045
01:13:01,033 --> 01:13:02,533
- What?
- My 5 bucks.

1046
01:13:03,534 --> 01:13:04,834
All right.

1047
01:13:33,735 --> 01:13:36,235
- How long have I been out?
- You took quite a jolt.

1048
01:13:39,836 --> 01:13:42,700
Kathy, did you send the police
down to the Union Station?

1049
01:13:42,701 --> 01:13:44,200
I tried to, they wouldn't go.

1050
01:13:44,201 --> 01:13:46,901
They said they couldn't hold anyone
unless there was a crime committed.

1051
01:13:47,802 --> 01:13:49,902
Isn't cracking skulls a crime?

1052
01:13:49,903 --> 01:13:52,103
Don't look at me.
I just drive a patrol car.

1053
01:13:52,104 --> 01:13:54,104
Do you want to file charges
against somebody?

1054
01:13:56,205 --> 01:13:59,405
Can you get an address
from a license number this time of night?

1055
01:13:59,406 --> 01:14:00,706
Sure we can.

1056
01:14:00,707 --> 01:14:02,607
You got a homicide man
at the Hollywood Station?

1057
01:14:02,998 --> 01:14:05,208
They didn't kill you.
You'll live.

1058
01:14:05,709 --> 01:14:07,109
Come on. Let's go.

1059
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:09,710
Am I coming? I seem to recall
we had a date for dinner.

1060
01:14:10,211 --> 01:14:11,411
We did, but...

1061
01:14:11,412 --> 01:14:14,002
I guess you'll have to settle
for that milk after all, Kathy.

1062
01:14:14,003 --> 01:14:16,003
Could I have two minutes
before you go?

1063
01:14:16,504 --> 01:14:18,404
We can cover it in ten seconds.

1064
01:14:18,905 --> 01:14:20,805
You were right, Kathy.

1065
01:14:21,306 --> 01:14:23,206
I don't know your brother
from Adam.

1066
01:14:23,807 --> 01:14:27,607
I could expand on that, but I think Janie
still has some unfinished business.

1067
01:14:28,708 --> 01:14:29,908
Thanks, Doc.

1068
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:15,609
I found the ticket, Danny.

1069
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:16,810
I found it.

1070
01:15:16,811 --> 01:15:18,611
It's all clear sailing now.

1071
01:15:18,612 --> 01:15:21,112
Go away. Creep back out.

1072
01:15:21,113 --> 01:15:23,313
Lock the door, Danny,
Pull the blinds.

1073
01:15:45,714 --> 01:15:48,214
What's the matter?

1074
01:15:48,215 --> 01:15:50,715
I'm worried. I don't get it.

1075
01:15:50,716 --> 01:15:54,516
The money's in that bag, Danny.
We're leaving for Mexico with it.

1076
01:15:54,517 --> 01:15:56,617
Like I say, I don't get it.

1077
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:59,018
- Why we?
- I need you.

1078
01:15:59,019 --> 01:16:01,619
A woman traveling alone would attract
too much attention.

1079
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:03,820
Now, I've got to know
about that money.

1080
01:16:03,821 --> 01:16:05,621
Where it came from.

1081
01:16:05,622 --> 01:16:09,002
That's better.
Don't ever change, tiger.

1082
01:16:09,003 --> 01:16:12,003
I don't think I'd like you
with a heart.

1083
01:16:14,604 --> 01:16:16,104
Open the bag, Danny.

1084
01:16:28,505 --> 01:16:30,105
It's all ours.

1085
01:16:32,506 --> 01:16:34,906
- Let's have a drink.
- In a minute, Danny.

1086
01:16:34,907 --> 01:16:37,307
But first of all I've got to know
where the money came from

1087
01:16:37,308 --> 01:16:39,108
and if we can use it safely

1088
01:16:39,109 --> 01:16:41,709
There should be sixty grand
in there, tiger.

1089
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:43,310
Sixty grand.

1090
01:16:43,311 --> 01:16:45,811
- I gotta have a drink.
- Wait, Danny.

1091
01:16:45,812 --> 01:16:48,212
Somebody threw that money
into our car. Why?

1092
01:16:49,513 --> 01:16:53,713
Because you don't go into a guy's office
and their blackmail payoff, sweetie.

1093
01:16:53,714 --> 01:16:56,014
Besides, he didn't know
what I looked like.

1094
01:16:56,015 --> 01:16:57,815
And I wanted to keep it that way.

1095
01:16:57,816 --> 01:17:00,916
- But who is it, why did he...
- Never mind who it is, tiger.

1096
01:17:00,917 --> 01:17:04,937
But it's the kind of a thing
you come across only once in a lifetime.

1097
01:17:04,938 --> 01:17:06,938
I stumbled onto a racket.

1098
01:17:06,939 --> 01:17:09,139
A big man in town.

1099
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:12,140
Three floors of mahogany
in the Monarch Building.

1100
01:17:12,141 --> 01:17:13,841
Big insurance agency.

1101
01:17:13,842 --> 01:17:17,742
Sells policies on bridges,
and aqueducts and stuff.

1102
01:17:17,743 --> 01:17:20,843
Who ever heard of anything
happening to a bridge?

1103
01:17:20,844 --> 01:17:23,944
So the policies never
went back to New York.

1104
01:17:23,945 --> 01:17:29,145
They're just pieces of paper my benefactor's
 been collecting premiums on for years.

1105
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:33,046
I cut me a slice of last year's premium.

1106
01:17:33,547 --> 01:17:35,347
That's it.

1107
01:17:35,748 --> 01:17:37,148
Then...

1108
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:39,449
then the money isn't marked.

1109
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:40,750
We can spend it.

1110
01:17:40,751 --> 01:17:42,651
You said it, tiger.

1111
01:17:42,852 --> 01:17:43,999
Now...

1112
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,300
Let's have that drink.

1113
01:17:47,101 --> 01:17:48,401
Wait, Danny.

1114
01:17:48,402 --> 01:17:50,002
We'll make it a toast.

1115
01:17:50,003 --> 01:17:51,503
I'll get the glasses.

1116
01:17:51,504 --> 01:17:53,004
They're right there on that bench.

1117
01:18:11,305 --> 01:18:14,105
Here's to crime.
It pays.

1118
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:15,906
And pays.

1119
01:19:42,807 --> 01:19:44,807
Look at this, partner.
Take a sniff.

1120
01:19:46,008 --> 01:19:47,808
The whisky bottle wasn't spiked.

1121
01:19:47,809 --> 01:19:49,409
He took it like a good boy.

1122
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:50,610
Right in his glass.

1123
01:19:50,611 --> 01:19:53,111
Go out and call the lab
and the meat wagon.

1124
01:19:53,112 --> 01:19:54,412
Tell them it's a suicide.

1125
01:19:54,413 --> 01:19:59,413
It's no suicide. Your friend Mrs. Palmer
arranged this tableau.

1126
01:20:00,014 --> 01:20:02,514
- Any idea why?
- Yeah.

1127
01:20:02,515 --> 01:20:04,515
He helped to kill her husband.

1128
01:20:05,016 --> 01:20:07,016
If you've got something
to tell me, let's have it.

1129
01:20:08,217 --> 01:20:11,317
I think you'll find her husband
at the bottom of the lake at Westlake Park.

1130
01:20:12,018 --> 01:20:13,718
You don't say.

1131
01:20:13,719 --> 01:20:15,719
You know, I'm only a cop.

1132
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:16,720
When I checked the lake

1133
01:20:16,721 --> 01:20:18,821
I found they went there
the night he disappeared.

1134
01:20:18,822 --> 01:20:21,022
And they also left it together.

1135
01:20:21,023 --> 01:20:22,123
Oh now, look.

1136
01:20:22,124 --> 01:20:24,424
When they left the boat Palmer was
in a great big hurry.

1137
01:20:24,425 --> 01:20:27,025
He left the paying to his wife
and dashed up the steps.

1138
01:20:27,026 --> 01:20:28,926
And now I think I know why.

1139
01:20:28,927 --> 01:20:31,127
Palmer never got off that boat.

1140
01:20:31,528 --> 01:20:32,828
This guy did.

1141
01:20:32,829 --> 01:20:35,229
Then he drove Palmer's car
to San Diego.

1142
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:38,530
I could point a dozen things
wrong with that, but why bother?

1143
01:20:38,531 --> 01:20:41,391
If you're right, the body
will come up in a day or two.

1144
01:20:41,392 --> 01:20:44,392
Oh, no. I'm afraid
you'll have to drag the lake.

1145
01:20:44,393 --> 01:20:46,593
Jane's a pretty smart girl.

1146
01:20:46,594 --> 01:20:49,894
If she put him there,
she put him there to stay.

1147
01:20:51,095 --> 01:20:53,295
Anyone besides you
ever seen them together?

1148
01:20:53,896 --> 01:20:56,396
Look, what's the trouble?
Don't you want to lick this thing?

1149
01:20:56,397 --> 01:20:58,307
Do you know what it would cost
the Department

1150
01:20:58,308 --> 01:20:59,808
to close that lake and drag it?

1151
01:20:59,809 --> 01:21:02,509
We'd have to get an okay
from the Police Commission...

1152
01:21:02,510 --> 01:21:04,610
and the Bureau of Budget and Efficiency.

1153
01:21:04,611 --> 01:21:06,800
And if the lake management
raised enough of a hassle,

1154
01:21:06,801 --> 01:21:08,701
we might even have to go
to the City Council.

1155
01:21:09,202 --> 01:21:11,002
Hay, Chief, come here a minute.

1156
01:21:12,003 --> 01:21:13,803
What's the idea?
I haven't done any...

1157
01:21:13,804 --> 01:21:14,804
All right, all right.

1158
01:21:14,805 --> 01:21:17,305
She starts up the walk
and notices the door's open.

1159
01:21:17,306 --> 01:21:19,706
Then she sees our car
and decides to go away.

1160
01:21:19,707 --> 01:21:21,907
I was just trying to ask her
a polite question.

1161
01:21:21,908 --> 01:21:24,358
Polite, he says. How does he act
when he's being crude?

1162
01:21:24,359 --> 01:21:27,259
- Are you a friend of Fuller's?
- Friend of who?

1163
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:28,860
Come on inside.

1164
01:21:34,061 --> 01:21:35,361
What happened?

1165
01:21:37,002 --> 01:21:38,562
Did you ever see this before?

1166
01:21:41,663 --> 01:21:43,563
Was it with that?

1167
01:21:43,764 --> 01:21:45,964
You know anyone
who would have wanted to kill him?

1168
01:21:48,065 --> 01:21:49,965
He killed himself.

1169
01:21:50,266 --> 01:21:52,166
Oh, God have mercy on him...

1170
01:21:52,167 --> 01:21:53,967
What makes you think
he did it himself?

1171
01:21:53,968 --> 01:21:55,068
You got any reason?

1172
01:21:57,169 --> 01:21:59,069
He had a big deal on.

1173
01:22:00,770 --> 01:22:02,770
Fifty or sixty grand, he said.

1174
01:22:02,771 --> 01:22:05,071
But something went wrong.

1175
01:22:05,472 --> 01:22:08,172
I was with him
when he got that stuff.

1176
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:11,073
He didn't think I knew
what he was getting but I did.

1177
01:22:11,874 --> 01:22:13,774
- Oh, I wanna go home.
- Parker.

1178
01:22:13,775 --> 01:22:15,475
Take her home, get her name...

1179
01:22:15,476 --> 01:22:17,100
and find out where Fuller
got that poison.

1180
01:22:17,101 --> 01:22:18,101
Right.

1181
01:22:23,102 --> 01:22:24,402
As for you, brother,

1182
01:22:24,403 --> 01:22:26,903
I'm going to let you off
with a little friendly advice.

1183
01:22:26,904 --> 01:22:30,304
Don't ever try to involve the Department
in your private quarrels.

1184
01:22:30,305 --> 01:22:32,305
If you get any facts,
bring them around.

1185
01:22:32,306 --> 01:22:34,300
But until you do,
Palmer's a missing person

1186
01:22:34,301 --> 01:22:36,301
and this guy killed himself.
Now get going.

1187
01:22:36,602 --> 01:22:38,402
Palmer's a corpse.

1188
01:22:38,999 --> 01:22:41,903
How much would it cost me to have
the lake dragged and prove it to you?

1189
01:22:44,904 --> 01:22:48,304
What did the lady do to you, Blake,
besides sap you down?

1190
01:22:49,505 --> 01:22:51,305
It must have been something big.

1191
01:22:55,006 --> 01:22:57,106
Sure, son, you can drag the lake.

1192
01:22:57,107 --> 01:23:00,007
A guy did it about four years ago
looking for his wife.

1193
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:02,508
When he got through with it
it had cost him $4.000,

1194
01:23:02,509 --> 01:23:04,309
the park officials were suing him,

1195
01:23:04,310 --> 01:23:06,710
and his wife turned up in Modesta
with a truck driver.

1196
01:24:22,211 --> 01:24:23,511
Having trouble?

1197
01:24:23,512 --> 01:24:26,412
It's all fixed now, thanks.
I had a flat.

1198
01:24:26,413 --> 01:24:29,213
- Sure I can't help any?
- No, no, thanks very much.

1199
01:24:29,214 --> 01:24:30,914
It's a bad place to get stuck.

1200
01:24:30,915 --> 01:24:32,515
Blow out, huh?

1201
01:24:32,716 --> 01:24:33,816
Yes.

1202
01:24:36,017 --> 01:24:38,017
This small fortune belong to you, ma'am?

1203
01:24:38,018 --> 01:24:40,818
Yes, it must have dropped from my bag.

1204
01:24:40,819 --> 01:24:43,119
Suppose there's any more
from where that came from?

1205
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:59,720
With all that money, lady,
you ought to have some male protection.

1206
01:25:05,321 --> 01:25:06,721
Anything wrong, miss?

1207
01:25:06,722 --> 01:25:09,999
No, I had a flat but everything's
all right now.

1208
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:09,300
- Good night.
- Good night.

1209
01:26:10,701 --> 01:26:12,701
Good night, everybody.
It was nice meeting you.

1210
01:26:16,202 --> 01:26:19,702
And after dinner we'll go
to the front lawn for the Jai-Alai game.

1211
01:26:19,703 --> 01:26:22,303
I'm sorry, Carlos.
No.

1212
01:26:22,904 --> 01:26:24,404
I'm rather tired.

1213
01:26:24,405 --> 01:26:25,705
Of course.

1214
01:26:25,706 --> 01:26:26,999
Mañana.

1215
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:28,800
Mañana.

1216
01:27:36,201 --> 01:27:39,401
Well, nice place you have here,
Mrs. Palmer.

1217
01:27:39,402 --> 01:27:42,402
Oh, excuse me.
It's Miss Petrie now, isn't it?

1218
01:27:42,403 --> 01:27:44,903
That happens to be
my maiden name.

1219
01:27:44,904 --> 01:27:46,804
I've filed a suit for divorce.

1220
01:27:46,805 --> 01:27:48,605
That's a nice touch.

1221
01:27:48,606 --> 01:27:50,806
But widows don't need divorces,
do they?

1222
01:27:51,707 --> 01:27:53,807
I wasn't aware that I was a widow.

1223
01:27:54,208 --> 01:27:55,708
Doesn't matter.

1224
01:27:55,709 --> 01:27:58,009
I really came here
to talk about money.

1225
01:28:00,010 --> 01:28:01,410
I'd like, say,

1226
01:28:01,411 --> 01:28:03,511
half of what you brought
down with you.

1227
01:28:04,512 --> 01:28:08,212
That would be about $200, Mr...

1228
01:28:08,813 --> 01:28:10,413
What was your name?

1229
01:28:10,414 --> 01:28:12,114
It was Blake when you knew me.

1230
01:28:12,115 --> 01:28:14,115
You brought down about $60.000.

1231
01:28:14,516 --> 01:28:16,216
According to Danny's girlfriend.

1232
01:28:16,217 --> 01:28:17,617
I don't know any Danny and...

1233
01:28:19,718 --> 01:28:21,318
I haven't got any money.

1234
01:28:26,519 --> 01:28:28,019
I think you'd better leave.

1235
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:33,120
I swear I'll scream to wake the dead
if you don't get out of here.

1236
01:28:33,121 --> 01:28:35,121
Oh, it's too bad you can't
wake the dead, Jane.

1237
01:28:35,322 --> 01:28:36,822
It might save you.

1238
01:28:37,623 --> 01:28:40,923
You see,
I found your husband's body.

1239
01:28:43,524 --> 01:28:46,299
I told the Los Angeles Police
where I am.

1240
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:49,900
If there was any news of Alan,
I would have been notified.

1241
01:28:49,901 --> 01:28:51,701
Not about this you wouldn't.

1242
01:28:52,502 --> 01:28:54,402
You see, I let him drop back in.

1243
01:28:55,703 --> 01:28:58,703
Drop back?
Where?

1244
01:28:58,704 --> 01:29:00,204
Where you put him.

1245
01:29:00,205 --> 01:29:01,405
The lake.

1246
01:29:04,306 --> 01:29:05,706
Looking for something?

1247
01:29:07,007 --> 01:29:08,307
My lipstick.

1248
01:29:08,308 --> 01:29:09,999
Colt or Smith 'n Weston?

1249
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:13,500
Now...

1250
01:29:15,101 --> 01:29:17,401
what's this about lakes?

1251
01:29:17,402 --> 01:29:18,902
Just one lake.

1252
01:29:18,903 --> 01:29:21,903
And if we can't make a deal,
I'm going back and drag him up again.

1253
01:29:23,504 --> 01:29:24,604
Oh...

1254
01:29:24,605 --> 01:29:26,505
How much do you want?

1255
01:29:26,506 --> 01:29:28,306
I told you.
Half.

1256
01:29:29,707 --> 01:29:31,947
It's in the hotel safe.
I'll have to go get it.

1257
01:29:31,948 --> 01:29:32,948
Go ahead.

1258
01:29:35,949 --> 01:29:37,649
Aren't you afraid
I might not come back?

1259
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:39,750
You'll come back.

1260
01:29:39,751 --> 01:29:41,651
How do I know
you won't take it all?

1261
01:29:41,652 --> 01:29:44,552
That would make me a cad, Jane.
I couldn't do that.

1262
01:29:44,953 --> 01:29:47,453
Get the money.
I'll be satisfied with half.

1263
01:30:13,754 --> 01:30:15,954
It has a nice cool look,
hasn't it, Jane?

1264
01:30:17,255 --> 01:30:18,855
It tempts me.

1265
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,456
But this will cover it.

1266
01:30:22,457 --> 01:30:24,157
What do you mean by that?

1267
01:30:24,158 --> 01:30:26,558
Giving you a strict accounting
of refunds, Mrs. Palmer.

1268
01:30:27,259 --> 01:30:29,959
I had to know for sure
if your husband was really in that lake.

1269
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:32,860
This is the price
for having the lake dragged.

1270
01:30:32,861 --> 01:30:34,861
What do you mean?
What are you trying to say?

1271
01:30:34,862 --> 01:30:37,162
I'm trying to tell you, Jane,
you're all washed up.

1272
01:30:37,163 --> 01:30:39,163
You can't take my money and...

1273
01:30:41,164 --> 01:30:42,964
- You're not...
- The law?

1274
01:30:42,965 --> 01:30:46,665
No. Just someone who couldn't
let you get away with it, Jane.

1275
01:30:47,266 --> 01:30:48,806
A killjoy.

1276
01:30:52,007 --> 01:30:53,607
Here it is!
You want it, don't you?

1277
01:30:57,208 --> 01:30:59,408
It's yours.
All you have to do is take it.

1278
01:30:59,409 --> 01:31:02,609
You can't see it, Mrs. Palmer,
but I'm riding a big white horse.

1279
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:04,410
This is a vendetta.

1280
01:31:04,411 --> 01:31:06,111
But it's over now.

1281
01:31:06,812 --> 01:31:09,512
Please page Teniente Rivera.
He's in the lobby.

1282
01:31:10,713 --> 01:31:12,313
Rivera, I'm in her apartment.

1283
01:31:12,314 --> 01:31:13,914
She has the money here.
All of it.

1284
01:31:14,215 --> 01:31:16,415
Yes. Right away.

1285
01:31:17,416 --> 01:31:18,476
You'll have to forgive me, Jane,

1286
01:31:18,477 --> 01:31:20,977
but I made formal charges
that you stole that money from me.

1287
01:31:21,178 --> 01:31:23,300
Now, you can sue me later
for false arrest but...

1288
01:31:23,301 --> 01:31:26,401
I had to figure some way of keeping you
in town till the L.A. Police get here.

1289
01:31:26,402 --> 01:31:28,300
 Why, Mr. Blake? Tell me why?

1290
01:31:28,301 --> 01:31:29,802
 Not Blake, Blanchard.

1291
01:31:29,803 --> 01:31:31,603
Does that mean anything to you?

1292
01:31:31,604 --> 01:31:32,604
I...

1293
01:31:33,105 --> 01:31:34,905
I once married a man...

1294
01:31:35,206 --> 01:31:36,706
named Blanchard.

1295
01:31:36,707 --> 01:31:37,907
Yeah, it's my brother.

1296
01:31:38,408 --> 01:31:40,600
I was overseas when it happened
but I never really believed

1297
01:31:40,601 --> 01:31:42,201
Bob killed himself.

1298
01:31:42,202 --> 01:31:44,500
- You killed him.
- I swear I didn't kill him.

1299
01:31:44,501 --> 01:31:46,151
He found out I didn't love him
and he killed himself.

1300
01:31:46,152 --> 01:31:48,152
I swear it!
I swear I didn't kill him!

1301
01:31:48,153 --> 01:31:50,153
There are many ways
of killing a man, Jane.

1302
01:31:50,154 --> 01:31:51,954
And now that I know you...

1303
01:31:52,455 --> 01:31:54,955
I can believe
Bob probably did kill himself.

1304
01:31:55,456 --> 01:31:57,256
But then there's Alan Palmer.

1305
01:31:58,057 --> 01:31:59,457
And your friend Danny.

1306
01:31:59,458 --> 01:32:01,858
You're all through killing now, Jane.

1307
01:32:07,759 --> 01:32:09,759
Wait, he's lying!
The money is mine!

1308
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:12,290
Please, señorita, we wish no trouble.

1309
01:32:12,291 --> 01:32:14,891
- You come with us, eh?
- No! I tell you he's lying!

1310
01:32:26,892 --> 01:32:28,292
Someone get a doctor!

1311
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:29,900
No need for a doctor.
She's dead.

1312
01:32:29,901 --> 01:32:32,001
- How did it happen?
- She fell from the balcony.

1313
01:32:35,502 --> 01:32:37,102
Vamos, muchachos...

1314
01:33:01,803 --> 01:33:05,203
Well, it was a short honeymoon,
Kathy.

1315
01:33:06,704 --> 01:33:08,304
We're going home now.

1316
01:33:10,505 --> 01:33:13,505
- Jane?
- Yeah.

1317
01:33:22,906 --> 01:33:25,406
