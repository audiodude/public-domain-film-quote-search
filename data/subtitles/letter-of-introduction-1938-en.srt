1
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:05,101
Well, here we are on Broadway folks

2
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:06,705
New Years Eve on Broadway

3
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,560
Everybody is happy.

4
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,490
Why?

5
00:01:08,492 --> 00:01:11,379
Because I know the New Year has better things in store for them.

6
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,049
[unintelligable]

7
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,427
Guaranteed to cure any headaches no matter how much you deserve one.

8
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:22,227
Now, let's find out what Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Public think about all this.

9
00:01:22,422 --> 00:01:24,983
And you could see there is a lovely little lady coming my way right now

10
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,816
And you'd wonder what she has to say

11
00:01:26,816 --> 00:01:28,163
Come on, Miss, aw...

12
00:01:28,205 --> 00:01:30,413
You know what they say, this is New Year's Eve!

13
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:31,942
Kay!

14
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,485
Kay!

15
00:01:36,311 --> 00:01:37,087
Kay!

16
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:38,657
Do you need any help?

17
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:40,234
Hello, Mr. Burgin.

18
00:01:40,436 --> 00:01:41,718
Hard going, isn't it?

19
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,668
Oh, crowds mean nothing to me

20
00:01:43,668 --> 00:01:46,169
after a two week's engagement in Macy's basement.

21
00:01:46,852 --> 00:01:47,874
Tired?

22
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:51,001
An actress of your ability working in department stores

23
00:01:51,032 --> 00:01:52,634
Well that's show business for you!

24
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,657
There's one thing: if I'm ever called to play the part 
of a package wrapper,

25
00:01:56,657 --> 00:01:57,600
I'll be superbe!

26
00:01:57,895 --> 00:01:59,533
Burnhouse couldn't do it better.

27
00:01:59,575 --> 00:02:02,678
What you need is a couple of rooms somewhere and a husband to look after you.

28
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,102
I might considered Charlie McCarthy.

29
00:02:05,102 --> 00:02:06,913
Well, you wouldn't if you really knew him

30
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:08,982
You know, I been thinking lately

31
00:02:08,982 --> 00:02:10,945
that Charlie and I would separate.

32
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:12,014
Separate?

33
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,265
You and Charlie?

34
00:02:13,452 --> 00:02:17,237
I know, but people just aren't interested in
 ventriloquists and their dummies.

35
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,521
Hey, you are in a bad way.

36
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:22,778
Come on. Snap out of it.
 It's a New Year.

37
00:02:22,778 --> 00:02:24,222
And it's going to be a good one!

38
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,931
Good for both of us. 
I know.

39
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:26,920
Hope so.

40
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:28,549
What's that?

41
00:02:57,912 --> 00:02:59,389
Edgar, look.

42
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,283
Look where they're stopping.

43
00:03:02,213 --> 00:03:03,130
Is it ours?

44
00:03:03,164 --> 00:03:04,557
I don't know. It might be.

45
00:03:04,596 --> 00:03:06,488
Edgar, it is! 
It's our house.

46
00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:27,462
Charlie! Charlie's up there.

47
00:03:27,462 --> 00:03:28,623
And my letter!

48
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:31,122
You need to wait a minute.

49
00:03:31,255 --> 00:03:32,775
Hey you! Come back here.

50
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:33,749
Edgar! Edgar!

51
00:03:33,749 --> 00:03:35,447
My letter of introduction

52
00:03:35,488 --> 00:03:37,954
It's in my room in the top bureau drawer!
 - All right...

53
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,295
Come on. Get back here.

54
00:03:39,295 --> 00:03:41,320
Please officer, I don't think he heard!

55
00:03:46,821 --> 00:03:49,412
<i>[indistinct yelling]</i>

56
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,452
<i>[indistinct yelling]</i>

57
00:03:56,911 --> 00:03:58,489
Charlie. Come on, we got to get out of here.

58
00:03:58,491 --> 00:04:01,863
What's that? I thought the landlady gave us until Monday to give up the rent?

59
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:05,566
Achoo! What's she trying to do? Smoke us out of here?

60
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:07,221
No, the building is on fire.

61
00:04:07,221 --> 00:04:08,952
Wow! Let's get out of here.

62
00:04:10,882 --> 00:04:12,734
Did the Juggling Jacobeses get out all right?

63
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:13,618
Yeah -- uh, Hey!

64
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,686
I'll Juggling Jacobes you, if you don't get back there!

65
00:04:15,686 --> 00:04:17,173
Alright, alright. 
 Take it easy.

66
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,805
Alright, come on folks. 
Move back.

67
00:04:19,044 --> 00:04:19,811
Move back!

68
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:23,201
I don't like a guy like that. 
You ask him a simple question, and he...

69
00:04:25,823 --> 00:04:26,905
Hey, I know you.

70
00:04:27,038 --> 00:04:28,537
Oh, that makes me happy.
Officer.

71
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,417
No, honestly, I do.

72
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:32,259
You live right up there in the third floor upfront.

73
00:04:32,613 --> 00:04:35,183
I live across the street. 
Do you see the people up there in the window?

74
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,783
My house is burning, and he doesn't even...

75
00:04:45,516 --> 00:04:46,714
Edgar, did you get my letter?

76
00:04:46,714 --> 00:04:47,482
What letter?

77
00:04:47,482 --> 00:04:49,576
She wrote you to tell you the house was on fire!

78
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,500
Hey, Kay don't go in there!

79
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,034
<i>Stop! Come on that'll finish the both of you!</i>

80
00:04:58,852 --> 00:05:00,078
Kay, where are you?

81
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,633
Come back here.

82
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,234
Kay, where you're going?

83
00:05:05,725 --> 00:05:08,078
Are you nuts? This place is on fire!

84
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,816
Come on back here!

85
00:05:10,547 --> 00:05:12,394
Of all the stupid dames!

86
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:16,122
Of all the Dumb Dora's risking out lives to--

87
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:17,509
Who ask you to follow me?

88
00:05:17,878 --> 00:05:19,402
That stops me.

89
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,925
Maybe that thing is locked.

90
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:24,026
Well, if you stop shouting for a minute, I might be able to open it.

91
00:05:27,344 --> 00:05:30,537
Come on, come on. Would you please get what you're after, and let's get out of here.

92
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:31,808
Here it is. Thank heavens!

93
00:05:31,808 --> 00:05:34,034
- That must be a very important document.
 - It is.

94
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:43,181
Don't be afraid.

95
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:45,241
Come on, let's go this way.

96
00:05:47,864 --> 00:05:50,440
Don't worry. We'll be out of here in a jiffy.

97
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,341
Here.
Let me help you.

98
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:02,846
Ah, that's got it!

99
00:06:05,953 --> 00:06:08,519
Whoa woo! 
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

100
00:06:09,764 --> 00:06:10,973
I'm alright.

101
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:13,238
How are we going to get down?

102
00:06:13,398 --> 00:06:14,876
Let's go this way. Come on.

103
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:17,405
Can you jump?

104
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:18,211
Jump?

105
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:19,951
Oh yes, I think so.

106
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,688
There you are. You all right?

107
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:26,947
Yes, thanks.

108
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:29,720
I'd have been down there dead if it weren't for you.

109
00:06:29,946 --> 00:06:30,848
You've saved my life.

110
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,269
Oh, well, now you're not going to try 
and make a hero of me, are you?

111
00:06:33,312 --> 00:06:34,758
<i>Barry!</i>

112
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:35,910
Hello there.

113
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:39,162
Barry, come on , let's go. 
The house is on fire.

114
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:40,658
That is where I lived.

115
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:41,648
So, you've told me.

116
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:43,790
Oh, lady.
 You haven't heard anything yet.

117
00:06:44,085 --> 00:06:45,972
You know I have a confession to make to you.

118
00:06:46,003 --> 00:06:49,237
I've been sitting in that window for months, looking right in your life.

119
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:50,793
Oh, a Peeping Tom!

120
00:06:50,793 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah, isn't it awful?

121
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:53,947
I- I could tell when you were high

122
00:06:54,264 --> 00:06:56,176
and I could also tell when you were blue.

123
00:06:56,484 --> 00:06:58,866
And many's the time you made my mouth water when

124
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:00,828
you were poaching eggs over that electric iron!

125
00:07:01,318 --> 00:07:02,792
Whew! Let's go!

126
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:07,946
-Go on, get back!
-He can't push me!

127
00:07:07,952 --> 00:07:09,753
I can't, eh? Well, get back!
- I guess you can.

128
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:11,052
My name's McCarthy, I--

129
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:12,922
I don't care what your name is.
Get back!

130
00:07:20,353 --> 00:07:21,505
Kay!

131
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:25,368
I got it, or rather he did.

132
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:26,729
Thank goodness, you're safe.

133
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:27,641
Officer

134
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:28,937
Would we be able to go in there?

135
00:07:28,937 --> 00:07:31,283
No one can go in there. 
The place is a wreck.

136
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,242
Gee, that's kinda tough. Burnt out on New Year's Eve.

137
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,376
Burnt out or thrown out... What's the difference?

138
00:07:36,562 --> 00:07:38,312
Well, uh... What are you fellas going to do?

139
00:07:38,317 --> 00:07:41,221
Oh, we'll curl up with a nice book somewhere.

140
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:42,782
Say, I've got an idea.

141
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:44,852
Why don't you come up to my place?
 We're having a little party.

142
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:47,351
I think I can grow to care for you!

143
00:07:50,923 --> 00:07:52,129
Three flights to heaven.

144
00:07:52,136 --> 00:07:53,306
Hope you don't mind.

145
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,763
You're lucky to have stairs. We're fresh out.

146
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,055
Looks like just another fire trap if you ask me.

147
00:07:59,055 --> 00:08:00,224
I didn't ask you.

148
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:04,020
My mansion in the hills!

149
00:08:04,054 --> 00:08:05,431
<i>There's Barry, now!</i>

150
00:08:07,438 --> 00:08:08,504
The fire is out.

151
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,068
Ladies and gentlemen, I brought you back a couple of refugees.

152
00:08:11,304 --> 00:08:12,287
Ms. Kay Martin.

153
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:13,473
Mr. Edgar Bergen.

154
00:08:13,484 --> 00:08:15,358
Meet the Bushelites of Broadway!

155
00:08:17,482 --> 00:08:19,235
May I take your coat?

156
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:22,355
Who are the Bushelites?

157
00:08:22,462 --> 00:08:25,373
Alas, they're artists who hide their lights under bushels!
 [Hence 'bushel-lights']

158
00:08:27,234 --> 00:08:28,770
The place certainly looks lived in.

159
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,639
Quiet!

160
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,775
Quiet. All right.

161
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,123
Did you see the Juggling Jacobeses?

162
00:08:33,123 --> 00:08:34,222
Did they get out alright?

163
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,594
I hope so! I didn't see them.

164
00:08:35,859 --> 00:08:37,195
My name is Honey, honey.

165
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:38,542
Hope you didn't lose anything.

166
00:08:38,593 --> 00:08:40,499
I don't think so. 
We'll know in the morning.

167
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,367
Beer?

168
00:08:41,464 --> 00:08:42,133
Thank you.

169
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:45,994
Beer?

170
00:08:45,994 --> 00:08:46,906
Thank you.

171
00:08:48,817 --> 00:08:50,357
Na-ah-ah, Bergen! 
- Quiet,

172
00:08:50,357 --> 00:08:51,556
can't you see I'm trying to drink?

173
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:55,121
Yes, but, uh, Honey honey didn't get Charlie Charlie any beer.

174
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:58,993
I beg your pardon. 
I'll get you some.

175
00:08:58,993 --> 00:09:01,130
Whew, right, right right...

176
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:04,366
Honey, my partner

177
00:09:04,384 --> 00:09:06,202
she's a swell kid! You'll like her.

178
00:09:06,202 --> 00:09:07,033
What you do?

179
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:07,838
We dance.

180
00:09:07,883 --> 00:09:09,691
Just at the moment, according to our agents

181
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:12,629
we're resting after a long and arduous tour!

182
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:15,054
And, uh... what do you do?

183
00:09:15,342 --> 00:09:16,496
Well, I'm a Bushelite, too.

184
00:09:16,496 --> 00:09:19,132
I'm resting after a long run in Shuberts' outer office.

185
00:09:19,163 --> 00:09:20,721
Oh ho, congratulations!

186
00:09:22,747 --> 00:09:24,362
Here you are, Charlie dear.

187
00:09:24,672 --> 00:09:28,294
Oh! Last but not least, I thank you.

188
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:30,861
I, uh. I- I- I...

189
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:32,847
Too much beer isn't good for little boys.

190
00:09:33,257 --> 00:09:34,371
Too much beer, no.

191
00:09:34,527 --> 00:09:37,495
Uh, huh. Well, you certainly took care of that!

192
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:42,321
Ah, it's fine.

193
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:44,002
Yes?
- Yes.

194
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:45,288
Oh, I w...

195
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,401
It's good.

196
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:49,532
- Well, I wouldn't know about that.
- No.

197
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:52,777
A ventriloquist!

198
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:54,143
Can you beat that?

199
00:09:54,171 --> 00:09:55,861
I didn't think they existed anymore.

200
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,184
When a house burns, you never know what's coming out.

201
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:00,875
I don't think I'm gonna like her.

202
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:05,101
Greetings!

203
00:10:07,243 --> 00:10:08,227
Oh, bearing gifts!

204
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,926
What? No caviar?

205
00:10:10,931 --> 00:10:13,481
No, dear. Woolworth's isn't carrying it this year.

206
00:10:13,954 --> 00:10:16,408
Oh, well, Cora, This is Miss Kay Martin.

207
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:17,491
How do you do?
- How are you?

208
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,849
And that's Edgar Bergen.

209
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:19,638
How you do?

210
00:10:20,134 --> 00:10:22,297
How you do? How do you do?

211
00:10:22,402 --> 00:10:24,321
This is Cora Phelps. She's working.

212
00:10:24,344 --> 00:10:25,670
<i>Dooo tell!</i>

213
00:10:25,924 --> 00:10:28,755
Well, you didn't look jealous. It's only a walk-on.

214
00:10:28,968 --> 00:10:31,339
I appear in the 3rd act and say,

215
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,163
"I'm Jeffery's wife."

216
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:35,420
"He's killed himself."

217
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:36,694
Can you blame him?

218
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:39,375
Aren't you ashamed?

219
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,905
A great big dummy like you making fun of my acting.

220
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,194
Is-is my face red? I didn't know you were acting!

221
00:10:47,678 --> 00:10:49,965
Oh, isn't he wonderful!

222
00:10:57,393 --> 00:10:59,423
I really ought to be thinking of a place to sleep.

223
00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:00,688
Oh, leave that to Honey.

224
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:01,868
She'll figure it out.

225
00:11:01,908 --> 00:11:04,011
She and the landlady are just like that.

226
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:05,562
She is nice.

227
00:11:05,562 --> 00:11:06,801
Ladies and gentlemen...

228
00:11:07,268 --> 00:11:10,340
<i>"We speak to you from the Rainbow Room at Rockefeller Center.</i>

229
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,432
<i>It is now 15 seconds before midnight.</i>

230
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:54,648
Happy New Year, Kay!

231
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:56,315
The same to you, Edgar, and many of them.

232
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:57,033
Me too?

233
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:58,427
Yes, Charlie. 
You too.

234
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,534
That nasty old year is gone, darling.

235
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,897
I hope the new one's much more fun.

236
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:04,060
I hope so.

237
00:12:05,696 --> 00:12:06,540
Happy New Year.

238
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,747
Happy New Year.

239
00:12:08,431 --> 00:12:09,433
Well, excuse me.

240
00:12:12,236 --> 00:12:14,035
Barry, Happy New year.

241
00:12:14,371 --> 00:12:16,827
Looks like a good game. We ought to get in it, Bergen!

242
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,209
Happy New Year, Barry.

243
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:19,963
Happy New Year to you, Kay.

244
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,629
Shall we dance?

245
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,166
What is this?

246
00:12:55,854 --> 00:12:57,990
I wouldn't know what to call that, would you?

247
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:00,018
Uh, "Love à la Barry".

248
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:05,377
Good night!

249
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,714
Good night, Jimmy!

250
00:13:07,445 --> 00:13:11,336
Oh, hey! Cut it out. What's the idea? What's all the noise around here?

251
00:13:11,622 --> 00:13:13,655
Oh, look at Ray! Look at Ray in the Top!

252
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:16,591
The uniform got her again!

253
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:18,269
It's cold!

254
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:20,052
Well, good night, kid-sies.

255
00:13:20,052 --> 00:13:21,429
I'll be seeing you in bed.

256
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:23,057
Good night, Cora.
Good night.

257
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,627
It's beginning to snow.

258
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:29,210
You better get inside where it's warm and close the window.

259
00:13:29,337 --> 00:13:31,592
Oh, wait a minute. 
A little fresh air is good for you.

260
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:32,643
Not me.

261
00:13:32,739 --> 00:13:33,587
Good night, dear.

262
00:13:33,622 --> 00:13:35,329
I'll lay a nightgown out on the couch for you.

263
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:36,604
Thanks. I'll be right down.

264
00:13:36,653 --> 00:13:37,949
- Good night, Barry.
- Good night, Honey.

265
00:13:38,124 --> 00:13:38,868
Good night.

266
00:13:41,205 --> 00:13:43,880
I feel terribly guilty, letting Honey do all this for me.

267
00:13:43,981 --> 00:13:45,917
Oh, don't worry about her. She likes it.

268
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:48,019
Honey's got the biggest heart in the world.

269
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:50,937
That must be the dawn!

270
00:13:52,075 --> 00:13:54,384
See, where it's getting light over there in the top of that building?

271
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,000
Dawn of the new year.

272
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,105
Does it mean that much to you?

273
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,148
Everything.

274
00:14:00,969 --> 00:14:02,999
You said you were going to tell me what was in that letter.

275
00:14:03,174 --> 00:14:03,811
Did I?

276
00:14:04,005 --> 00:14:05,313
Sure, don't you remember?

277
00:14:05,484 --> 00:14:09,202
You said it was a path toward the fame, fortune, and happiness.

278
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:10,926
It might easily be.

279
00:14:11,992 --> 00:14:13,957
Are you thinking of getting married?

280
00:14:13,957 --> 00:14:15,656
No, nothing like that.

281
00:14:15,782 --> 00:14:17,796
Well, I can't imagine what it could be.

282
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,800
Letter of introduction for John Mallory.

283
00:14:20,938 --> 00:14:22,452
John Mallory?

284
00:14:22,853 --> 00:14:24,326
The Great Lover!
 - Is he?

285
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:25,622
So they say.

286
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:28,018
On the screen and in private life, too.

287
00:14:28,205 --> 00:14:29,851
He's also a very great actor.

288
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,526
Oh! He's a great actor, alright.

289
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:33,076
All the Mallory's are good actors.

290
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:35,195
Well, I hope it brings you good luck.

291
00:14:35,358 --> 00:14:35,981
Thanks.

292
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,295
Getting cold.
I think I better go.

293
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,208
There.

294
00:14:43,605 --> 00:14:45,107
I guess that ought to be comfortable.

295
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,885
Thanks.

296
00:14:47,445 --> 00:14:49,199
Have you and Barry been together long?

297
00:14:50,147 --> 00:14:51,237
Five years.

298
00:14:52,256 --> 00:14:54,382
For five long, hard years.

299
00:14:55,486 --> 00:14:56,990
But I don't regret a day of it.

300
00:14:57,528 --> 00:14:58,927
Barry's been swell.

301
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:01,706
He's taught me and I've helped him.

302
00:15:02,757 --> 00:15:03,754
And all we need is a place to

303
00:15:03,754 --> 00:15:06,042
to get right up on top with Rogers and Estair.

304
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:08,340
I will get there.

305
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:11,094
Nothing could stop us.

306
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:14,856
If Cora snores, throw a slipper at her.

307
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:16,467
I'll be alright. 
Good night.

308
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:17,309
Good night.

309
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:30,613
John Mannering, celebrated stage and screen star,

310
00:15:30,613 --> 00:15:34,013
and Lydia Hoyt, his pretty twenty two years old bribe-to-be,

311
00:15:34,188 --> 00:15:36,977
were greeted by a throng of well-wishing fans.

312
00:15:37,007 --> 00:15:39,635
As they stepped off the gangplank yesterday afternoon.

313
00:15:40,048 --> 00:15:42,696
Ms. Hoyt will be the forth Mrs. Mannering.

314
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,401
Forth Mrs. Mannering.

315
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,312
They love him, but divorce him.

316
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,389
I ought to be like that.

317
00:15:48,527 --> 00:15:49,566
How about it, Bergen?

318
00:15:49,566 --> 00:15:51,043
Couldn't we afford a wife or two?

319
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:52,831
Listen to the young turkey!

320
00:15:53,938 --> 00:15:55,050
What time is it, Barry?

321
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:56,992
Two o'clock.

322
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,199
Ooo, I'd better hurry.

323
00:15:58,199 --> 00:15:58,937
Here you go.

324
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:00,464
You're gonna wear that hat?

325
00:16:00,464 --> 00:16:03,178
I guess I'll have to. My only nice one was soaked in the fire.

326
00:16:03,365 --> 00:16:03,996
Kay.

327
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:04,407
Yes.

328
00:16:04,502 --> 00:16:07,374
Don't you think you'd better phone Mallory first and ask for an appointment?

329
00:16:07,374 --> 00:16:09,787
Mhmm, I've been carrying this letter around for months.

330
00:16:10,116 --> 00:16:11,876
I'm not gonna give him a chance to put me off.

331
00:16:11,876 --> 00:16:13,751
Aren't you putting too much faith in that letter?

332
00:16:13,751 --> 00:16:14,444
Mhmm.

333
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,728
Well, if he doesn't do anything for you, I hope you won't be too disappointed.

334
00:16:17,863 --> 00:16:19,395
But he will, Barry.

335
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:21,854
This is the beginning of everything for me.

336
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,156
A man like Mallory can do a lot for you on Broadway. Here, try this one.

337
00:16:25,648 --> 00:16:27,022
Oh, Honey.

338
00:16:28,444 --> 00:16:30,231
Oh, you're an angel!

339
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:31,614
Hey! Bring out the sables.

340
00:16:32,223 --> 00:16:33,289
Sables!

341
00:16:33,516 --> 00:16:34,437
I wouldn't dare.

342
00:16:34,437 --> 00:16:37,090
Oh, they came out of a hock shop on 6th avenue.

343
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:39,511
Sables, get that. haha

344
00:16:39,713 --> 00:16:41,830
What won't they call rabbits next?

345
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,100
You can have a 3rd interest for 4$.

346
00:16:45,347 --> 00:16:46,558
Oh, they're lovely.

347
00:16:47,191 --> 00:16:48,019
How I look?

348
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:49,342
You look swell.

349
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,017
Oh, I don't know how I'm going to thank you.

350
00:16:51,017 --> 00:16:52,198
Have you got your letter?

351
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:52,818
Yes.

352
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,044
Well,

353
00:16:54,245 --> 00:16:56,111
I'll come back as soon as I see him.

354
00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:58,145
If it's good news, the party's on me.

355
00:16:58,216 --> 00:16:58,864
Goodbye.

356
00:16:58,905 --> 00:16:59,909
Goodbye.

357
00:16:59,924 --> 00:17:01,504
- Goodbye. 
- Goodbye. Good luck.

358
00:17:01,504 --> 00:17:02,632
I wonder if she'll see him.

359
00:17:02,681 --> 00:17:03,889
I wonder if he'll see her.

360
00:17:04,313 --> 00:17:05,807
I wonder what'll happen if they see each other?

361
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:07,240
Might be better if they didn't see each other!

362
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,477
Might be better if you shut up.

363
00:17:08,477 --> 00:17:08,929
Yes.

364
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:10,957
Well, that's another way of looking at it. Yeah.

365
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:23,424
Yes.

366
00:17:23,461 --> 00:17:24,961
I'll like to see Mr. Mannering, please.

367
00:17:25,028 --> 00:17:27,141
Mr. Mannering is occupied.
 He sees no one.

368
00:17:27,153 --> 00:17:29,327
Well, I'm sure he'll see me. 
I have a letter of introduction.

369
00:17:29,544 --> 00:17:30,330
From whom?

370
00:17:30,613 --> 00:17:33,243
Well, if you let me come inside, I'll tell you.

371
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:40,120
You were saying you have a letter.

372
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,655
Yes.

373
00:17:40,655 --> 00:17:43,068
You give it to me. I'll see that it reaches Mr. Mallory in due course.

374
00:17:43,068 --> 00:17:44,999
Perhaps an appointment can be arranged.

375
00:17:45,118 --> 00:17:47,270
Well, I couldn't do that. 
I have to see him in person.

376
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,705
Utterally out of the question!

377
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:51,338
This gentleman here has been waiting since half after one.

378
00:17:51,365 --> 00:17:52,380
You see how it is.

379
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:53,997
I have a great deal of patience.

380
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,683
Very well, I'm sure I've done my duty in warning you.

381
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:02,270
This happens to be a superbe example of a Bathava prayer rug.

382
00:18:02,658 --> 00:18:05,494
It is not intended to be used as an ashtray!

383
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,400
June. It was a cloudy day...

384
00:18:13,034 --> 00:18:15,047
The cemetery of Pere La Chaise

385
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:18,391
was the slate grey of a Joseph Pernell Skyscaper.

386
00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:22,947
I walked down the path past the tombs of Eloise and Abelard

387
00:18:23,473 --> 00:18:25,654
and I stopped in reverence before it.

388
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:29,483
Before the memory of their love that no man could put asunder.

389
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,671
I beg your pardon, sir.

390
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:32,805
No man could put asunder!

391
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:35,619
I went on in the mist.

392
00:18:35,804 --> 00:18:38,577
Until I came to where your sainted grandmother lived.

393
00:18:39,443 --> 00:18:40,318
And there,

394
00:18:40,468 --> 00:18:41,935
One by one,

395
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,439
as you directed,

396
00:18:44,061 --> 00:18:46,662
I let drop the springs of heliotrope.

397
00:18:46,712 --> 00:18:48,812
It was kind of you to remember, Monsieur.

398
00:18:48,974 --> 00:18:50,463
For a friend it was nothing.

399
00:18:51,818 --> 00:18:53,505
You stupid fool!

400
00:18:53,972 --> 00:18:55,154
You imbecile!

401
00:18:55,521 --> 00:18:57,365
I told you not to darken it too much.

402
00:18:57,797 --> 00:19:01,136
I wanted a bit of rake up over the temple and you make it look like a toupee!

403
00:19:01,136 --> 00:19:04,310
On the contrary, sir. A touch of gray would look infinitely more studied.

404
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:05,290
Stop lying!

405
00:19:05,513 --> 00:19:06,327
Tell me what you want.

406
00:19:06,327 --> 00:19:07,857
There are a number of important matters, sir.

407
00:19:07,857 --> 00:19:08,707
That'll be all.

408
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:09,903
This letter from Lou Woodstone...

409
00:19:09,903 --> 00:19:11,137
Well, what does he say?

410
00:19:11,532 --> 00:19:13,033
You old horse thief!

411
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,785
That's the salutation of the letter, sir.

412
00:19:15,944 --> 00:19:16,468
I see.

413
00:19:16,468 --> 00:19:19,554
You old horse thief, I sent you a play three months ago

414
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,554
You needn't read it. Just say you'll do it

415
00:19:21,554 --> 00:19:23,630
and get back in the theater where you belong.

416
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:25,227
Affectionately, Lou.

417
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:26,962
Uh... take a letter, Andrews.

418
00:19:27,484 --> 00:19:29,120
My dear old friend,

419
00:19:29,592 --> 00:19:32,199
Nothing on Earth could ever induce me to return to the theater,

420
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,515
you rat.

421
00:19:33,515 --> 00:19:34,121
Is this it?

422
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:35,073
Yes, sir.

423
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:38,389
I shall keep the manuscript as a souvenir. Affectionately, John.

424
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:39,260
Anything else?

425
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,936
Yes, sir. There's a lady with a letter of introduction, sir.

426
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,567
Well, tell her to leave it. I'm much too busy.

427
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:44,420
With pleasure, sir.

428
00:19:44,486 --> 00:19:45,976
And a newspaper reporter.

429
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:46,767
A journalist?

430
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:49,555
Well, now. We mustn't be ungracious to the press.

431
00:19:49,765 --> 00:19:51,073
Has he a photographer with him?

432
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:53,080
No, sir, but he may have a candid camera.

433
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,206
They hide them in the most extraordinary places, sir.

434
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:57,183
I'll give him five minutes. No more.

435
00:19:57,183 --> 00:19:59,024
Very good, sir.
- Uh, my coat, Andrews.
- Yes, sir.

436
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,384
I do miss old Rover. What's this one's name?

437
00:20:37,384 --> 00:20:38,923
<i>Blitzen, sir. He's German.</i>

438
00:20:38,923 --> 00:20:39,817
Blitzen. Does he bite?

439
00:20:39,817 --> 00:20:42,263
<i>Oh, no, sir. He's very tame. I'm sure he won't bite, sir.</i>

440
00:20:42,263 --> 00:20:43,146
Well, I'm not.

441
00:20:43,146 --> 00:20:44,442
<i>'Sitzen' Blitzen. 'Sitzen'!</i>

442
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,912
Why do you talk to him in a foreign language?

443
00:20:45,946 --> 00:20:47,368
He doesn't understand English, sir.

444
00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:48,907
But he's beautifully mannered.

445
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,135
'Sitzen'. 'Sitzen'!

446
00:20:50,655 --> 00:20:51,615
Lie down, Blitzen.

447
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:52,850
Lie down.

448
00:20:58,741 --> 00:21:00,611
A very lovely picture, sir.

449
00:21:03,318 --> 00:21:04,570
You may come in, now.

450
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,744
Not you. Him.

451
00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:10,705
Good afternoon, my friend.

452
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:14,558
I'm afraid that I can make no statement on my forthcoming plans until after the wedding.

453
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:15,692
Well, that's too bad, but...

454
00:21:15,786 --> 00:21:17,486
You are John Mallory, aren't you?

455
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:18,369
Sir?

456
00:21:18,993 --> 00:21:19,596
What's this?

457
00:21:19,596 --> 00:21:21,135
Just a summons, Mr. Mallory,

458
00:21:21,135 --> 00:21:22,534
for non-payment of alimony!

459
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:24,109
Sorry, to trouble you!

460
00:21:25,036 --> 00:21:26,743
Reporter!

461
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,728
Charleton.

462
00:21:31,368 --> 00:21:32,615
Blitzen. Nice Blitzen!

463
00:21:32,963 --> 00:21:34,083
Blitzen!

464
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,032
That's a Blitzen!

465
00:21:36,653 --> 00:21:37,775
Hold on!

466
00:21:38,745 --> 00:21:39,965
Please, Blitzen!

467
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,093
ANDREWS! Blitzen.

468
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:43,830
<i>[German command]</i>

469
00:21:45,423 --> 00:21:46,366
Andrews!

470
00:21:56,539 --> 00:21:57,409
How do you do?

471
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:01,495
Mr. Mallory?

472
00:22:01,495 --> 00:22:02,401
Yes.

473
00:22:02,908 --> 00:22:04,479
I have a letter of introduction.

474
00:22:05,502 --> 00:22:07,362
Ah, yes. A letter of introduction!

475
00:22:08,281 --> 00:22:10,379
I hope I didn't frighten you.

476
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:11,832
Oh that's quite all right.

477
00:22:13,693 --> 00:22:15,116
It's safe to come in now.

478
00:22:16,406 --> 00:22:17,369
Won't you come inside?

479
00:22:17,414 --> 00:22:18,144
Thank you.

480
00:22:23,962 --> 00:22:24,887
Won't you sit down?

481
00:22:25,341 --> 00:22:26,175
Thank you.

482
00:22:31,507 --> 00:22:32,691
That writing is familiar.

483
00:22:32,877 --> 00:22:33,892
Le Comte Valery?

484
00:22:34,156 --> 00:22:35,736
I don't believe you can guess.

485
00:22:35,736 --> 00:22:37,228
I think you'll have to read it.

486
00:23:15,321 --> 00:23:16,687
Please, say something.

487
00:23:17,967 --> 00:23:19,352
Where have you been, my dear?

488
00:23:19,754 --> 00:23:20,984
Why haven't I known?

489
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:23,620
I didn't know myself until recently.

490
00:23:24,485 --> 00:23:25,400
Take off your hat.

491
00:23:28,213 --> 00:23:29,080
No don't touch it.

492
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:30,799
Let me see you just as you are.

493
00:23:32,705 --> 00:23:34,198
Yes, I see it now.

494
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,398
Same forehead.

495
00:23:36,994 --> 00:23:38,276
Same lovely hair.

496
00:23:39,096 --> 00:23:41,308
Only your mother's, I imagine, is turning grey.

497
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:43,498
It turned very fast toward the end.

498
00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:45,624
She's dead?

499
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,206
A few months ago.

500
00:23:47,765 --> 00:23:49,952
I was in New York, trying to get a job.

501
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:51,713
Someone wired me.

502
00:23:52,443 --> 00:23:53,906
When I go there, she

503
00:23:54,235 --> 00:23:55,355
she gave me the letter.

504
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,832
It was the first time I knew.

505
00:23:59,178 --> 00:24:00,971
She felt she owed it to me and perhaps to you.

506
00:24:01,187 --> 00:24:02,339
Perhaps to you.

507
00:24:03,486 --> 00:24:04,913
And made me promise that

508
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:07,978
...forgive me...

509
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,452
Forgive you?

510
00:24:10,935 --> 00:24:12,291
No, my dear.

511
00:24:14,032 --> 00:24:15,615
I don't want to be any bother.

512
00:24:15,615 --> 00:24:16,608
Bother?

513
00:24:16,979 --> 00:24:18,352
My little girl!

514
00:24:19,896 --> 00:24:21,314
Let me look at you again.

515
00:24:22,788 --> 00:24:23,906
That takes me back.

516
00:24:24,472 --> 00:24:27,265
There were tears in her eyes, too the last time I saw her.

517
00:24:38,856 --> 00:24:40,245
After all these years...

518
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:42,096
to think that I found you!

519
00:24:44,522 --> 00:24:47,077
The first thing I remember is mother cutting out your clippings

520
00:24:47,077 --> 00:24:49,081
and pasting them in a big yellow scrapbook.

521
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,303
Later I used to read the notices and pretend they were mine.

522
00:24:52,986 --> 00:24:53,925
Let's see, I

523
00:24:54,195 --> 00:24:56,255
I played Ophelia with you

524
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:57,173
and Rosalind

525
00:24:57,214 --> 00:24:58,227
Roxanne

526
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,220
Oh, I was wonderful in that!

527
00:25:00,811 --> 00:25:02,653
Of course, we went to all your pictures.

528
00:25:03,112 --> 00:25:04,884
I don't think Mother ever missed any.

529
00:25:06,262 --> 00:25:09,329
Sometimes halfway through the story I'd see tears in her eyes.

530
00:25:10,205 --> 00:25:12,898
If I asked her why, she'd say the scene was sad.

531
00:25:13,873 --> 00:25:15,353
Once, I teased her about it.

532
00:25:16,171 --> 00:25:18,734
I said she was too old to have a crush on a movie star.

533
00:25:19,617 --> 00:25:21,793
She didn't answer, but I saw it hurt her. So,

534
00:25:21,818 --> 00:25:22,971
I never mentioned it again.

535
00:25:23,721 --> 00:25:25,091
How little one really knows!

536
00:25:25,556 --> 00:25:26,596
Why do you say that?

537
00:25:26,887 --> 00:25:29,207
If I had only realized. But how could I?

538
00:25:29,784 --> 00:25:32,322
I was so young at the time, excitable. Ambitious.

539
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,250
Without experience and a famous name to live up to

540
00:25:35,936 --> 00:25:38,558
when she refused to leave Nashville and take to the road with me, I

541
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:40,325
I thought she didn't care.

542
00:25:40,636 --> 00:25:41,514
We quarreled.

543
00:25:42,335 --> 00:25:44,629
I meant to go back, but somehow the time never came.

544
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,171
It was always a new season, a new play...

545
00:25:48,553 --> 00:25:50,219
Oh! I'm so sorry.

546
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:51,727
Lydia!

547
00:25:53,707 --> 00:25:55,728
I had no idea. Please don't let me disturb you.

548
00:25:55,728 --> 00:25:57,307
Lydia, darling!

549
00:25:57,329 --> 00:25:58,710
What a surprise!

550
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,972
Is that new?
- Yes.

551
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,853
Uh, come, dear, I want you to meet

552
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,828
my, uh.. My protege. Miss, uh

553
00:26:05,225 --> 00:26:06,406
Kay Martin. 
- Miss Martin.

554
00:26:06,468 --> 00:26:07,434
How do you do Miss Martin?

555
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:08,440
How do you do?

556
00:26:09,072 --> 00:26:11,989
I'm afraid I've stayed too long. Will you excuse me?

557
00:26:13,295 --> 00:26:15,154
Thank you for being so kind, and

558
00:26:15,505 --> 00:26:17,832
I won't bother you again until I hear from you.

559
00:26:21,898 --> 00:26:22,969
Will you excuse me.

560
00:26:25,806 --> 00:26:26,571
I'll uh...

561
00:26:26,748 --> 00:26:28,228
I'll see you to the elevator.

562
00:26:29,486 --> 00:26:30,280
Good bye.

563
00:26:30,332 --> 00:26:31,129
Good bye.

564
00:26:43,904 --> 00:26:45,173
I haven't even your address.

565
00:26:45,657 --> 00:26:47,136
Oh, how stupid of me.

566
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:48,649
I'll write it down.

567
00:26:56,711 --> 00:26:58,902
I feel the worst kind of blackguard.

568
00:26:58,956 --> 00:26:59,683
Why?

569
00:26:59,854 --> 00:27:01,023
I started to tell her.

570
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,616
I had every intention of telling her...

571
00:27:02,616 --> 00:27:04,985
but, the word, 'daughter' seemed to stick in my throat.

572
00:27:05,342 --> 00:27:07,395
I guess being a father so suddenly...

573
00:27:07,484 --> 00:27:08,277
upset me.

574
00:27:08,654 --> 00:27:09,916
I understand.

575
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,886
You can't suddenly spring a daughter on an unsuspecting world.

576
00:27:12,914 --> 00:27:15,235
No, I guess I'm just a vain and pompous idiot.

577
00:27:15,577 --> 00:27:16,454
No, you're not.

578
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,289
You're famous.

579
00:27:18,793 --> 00:27:20,114
You've a reputation.

580
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:23,509
And, please believe me. I don't want to complicate your life.

581
00:27:23,985 --> 00:27:24,871
If anything,

582
00:27:25,146 --> 00:27:27,103
I'd like to add a little happiness to it.

583
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:29,691
I'd like to feel that you can count on me.

584
00:27:29,893 --> 00:27:30,781
for anything.

585
00:27:30,994 --> 00:27:32,264
As a father should.

586
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:34,599
First time in my life, I

587
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:36,263
I can't find words.

588
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,883
Let's not bother about telling it now.

589
00:27:39,154 --> 00:27:40,957
It's been our secret for so long.

590
00:27:41,217 --> 00:27:42,541
Let's keep it that way.

591
00:27:43,206 --> 00:27:44,321
Will you kiss me?

592
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,407
I'm proud of you!

593
00:27:54,327 --> 00:27:55,254
Good bye.

594
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,223
And I'll call you soon.

595
00:27:57,223 --> 00:27:58,144
Good bye.

596
00:28:14,913 --> 00:28:16,396
Bother? Protege?

597
00:28:16,718 --> 00:28:17,655
Why do you lie to me?

598
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,156
Do you think I'm a stupid little fool?

599
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:21,368
Now, calm yourself Lydia. I didn't lie to you.
- You did!

600
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:21,835
I didn't!

601
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:22,999
You said she was a bother.

602
00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:24,209
But she was a bother-- I mean, there was a bother!

603
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:27,177
And now, she's a protege whose name you couldn't even remember!

604
00:28:27,213 --> 00:28:28,187
Lies! Lies! Lies!

605
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,200
Darling, she came to me with a letter of introduction

606
00:28:30,221 --> 00:28:31,578
from a very dear friend.
- Oh!

607
00:28:31,825 --> 00:28:33,572
Well, all right. If you don't believe me, here it is!

608
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:35,095
No. No!

609
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:36,813
I'm not going to show it to you.

610
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,593
This is no way to begin a marriage.

611
00:28:38,731 --> 00:28:40,851
You ought to know. You've had enough experience.

612
00:28:41,142 --> 00:28:43,014
"Distrust heals not reproof"!

613
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,483
If you quote anything I'll scream!

614
00:28:44,483 --> 00:28:45,898
Scream. Go ahead. It's good for you.

615
00:28:46,262 --> 00:28:47,468
I warn you, John.

616
00:28:47,576 --> 00:28:50,422
I'm not going to be longsuffering, like some of your other wives.

617
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:52,092
The first time I catch you doublecrossing me,

618
00:28:52,092 --> 00:28:53,507
I'll walk out on you so fast--

619
00:28:53,507 --> 00:28:55,716
Lydia, my adored one!

620
00:28:55,731 --> 00:28:57,830
How can you be so unfair to yourself?

621
00:28:57,905 --> 00:28:59,732
Don't you be unfair. That's all I ask.

622
00:28:59,792 --> 00:29:00,671
So lovely.

623
00:29:00,877 --> 00:29:01,898
So charming.

624
00:29:02,096 --> 00:29:03,126
Well, I would no more...

625
00:29:03,126 --> 00:29:05,652
Go on! I can <i>feel</i> the cameras grinding!

626
00:29:05,734 --> 00:29:07,721
What you feel is the beat of my heart.

627
00:29:07,989 --> 00:29:09,394
Pounding for the love of you!

628
00:29:14,435 --> 00:29:17,326
I must be out of my mind to think of marrying you.

629
00:29:17,788 --> 00:29:19,192
Just plain mad.

630
00:29:25,012 --> 00:29:25,913
Achoo!

631
00:29:26,525 --> 00:29:27,800
Let me toot some more.

632
00:29:29,332 --> 00:29:33,600
If you'd put those steps end to end you'd be
 halfway to Benton Harbor, Michigan by now.

633
00:29:34,269 --> 00:29:36,487
Say, when do we eat? I'm starved.

634
00:29:36,487 --> 00:29:38,655
I wonder where she could be? It's after 6 o'clock.

635
00:29:38,655 --> 00:29:40,213
I don't know, but I wish she'd hurry.

636
00:29:40,356 --> 00:29:41,997
I'm dying to find out what happened.

637
00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:43,644
What makes you think you're gonna?

638
00:29:43,644 --> 00:29:44,453
Shut up, Charlie.

639
00:29:44,453 --> 00:29:45,887
Now, wait a minute, now.

640
00:29:45,888 --> 00:29:49,265
Now, let's reconstruct this scene from a scientific point of view.

641
00:29:49,574 --> 00:29:52,374
Attractive girl goes to great lover's apartment.

642
00:29:52,784 --> 00:29:54,315
...to ask a favor, see...

643
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:56,481
Now, let me see...

644
00:29:56,534 --> 00:29:59,954
If I was a great lover and a girl came to my apartment...

645
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,005
Oh, boy! There's your answer.

646
00:30:03,076 --> 00:30:04,113
Barry, where're you going?

647
00:30:04,113 --> 00:30:04,968
Out.

648
00:30:07,089 --> 00:30:08,734
He's really got it bad.

649
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,273
Kay!

650
00:30:12,273 --> 00:30:14,102
Oh, Barry! I'm so happy I'm going to burst.

651
00:30:14,102 --> 00:30:15,132
What kept you so late?

652
00:30:15,132 --> 00:30:16,671
Oh, he was wonderful!

653
00:30:18,036 --> 00:30:19,445
Oh, if I could only tell you.

654
00:30:19,445 --> 00:30:20,444
Tell me what?

655
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:23,168
He's the kindest, sweetest, dearest man I've ever known!

656
00:30:23,349 --> 00:30:25,166
No wonder all the women are crazy about him!

657
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:26,851
Yeah, that's just what I was afraid of.

658
00:30:26,896 --> 00:30:29,516
Oh, but he's thrilling! If you could just see him or hear him talk.

659
00:30:29,555 --> 00:30:31,753
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You haven't forgotten me, have you, pal?

660
00:30:31,753 --> 00:30:34,689
Barry. Remember Barry Page? The fella that's crazy about you?

661
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:37,061
Oh, Barry, I love you! I love you! I love you!

662
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:38,265
Oh, I love everybody.

663
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:42,113
Just a second, are you by any change making love to me and thinking about him?

664
00:30:42,113 --> 00:30:43,252
Oh, don't be ridiculous!

665
00:30:43,252 --> 00:30:44,699
That guy must be a wizard.

666
00:30:44,828 --> 00:30:45,978
He is.

667
00:30:47,027 --> 00:30:48,421
Well, the dinner's on me!

668
00:30:48,421 --> 00:30:49,382
Any luck?
- How'd it go?

669
00:30:49,382 --> 00:30:50,008
Did you get in?

670
00:30:50,061 --> 00:30:51,506
Honestly, I don't know where to begin.

671
00:30:51,506 --> 00:30:53,370
He's wonderful. I can tell you that much.

672
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,762
Did he show you his etchings?

673
00:30:54,762 --> 00:30:57,285
Oh, people are all wrong to talk about him the way they do!

674
00:30:57,285 --> 00:30:58,340
He's a darling!

675
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,473
He wouldn't harm a flea.

676
00:30:59,473 --> 00:31:01,838
Well, it's nice to know he draws the line somewhere!

677
00:31:02,207 --> 00:31:03,687
Oh, Charlie, keep quiet.

678
00:31:04,631 --> 00:31:05,389
Tell me, Kay.

679
00:31:05,534 --> 00:31:07,202
What's he going to do for you? Anything?

680
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,504
Well, we didn't have time to talk about it.

681
00:31:08,504 --> 00:31:09,600
But I'm sure he will!

682
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,137
You didn't have time? You've been gone four hours!

683
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:15,395
Well, I was late in getting there. Then I had to wait to see him and then we had tea--

684
00:31:15,395 --> 00:31:17,714
Look, I'm famished. Let's hear the rest about it at dinner.

685
00:31:17,724 --> 00:31:18,745
All right. Where should we go?

686
00:31:18,745 --> 00:31:20,489
Charlie go, too?
- Of course!

687
00:31:20,493 --> 00:31:22,999
If you take that dummy, you'll upset the whole restaurant again.

688
00:31:23,037 --> 00:31:24,677
And no hiding me under a shawl.

689
00:31:24,677 --> 00:31:27,477
Either I go as an American citizen or I stay at home in a trunk!

690
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:29,072
I don't blame you, Charlie.

691
00:31:29,423 --> 00:31:30,234
Come in.

692
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,301
Telephone, Miss Martin.

693
00:31:33,338 --> 00:31:34,501
<i>For me? Who is it?</i>

694
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:36,068
He says it's John Mallory.

695
00:31:36,265 --> 00:31:37,524
But I have my doubts.

696
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,949
Excuse me, please.

697
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,115
Hello?

698
00:31:47,164 --> 00:31:47,796
Tonight?

699
00:31:48,556 --> 00:31:50,624
<i>He hasn't lost much time, has he?</i>

700
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,050
<i>She must have made a hit.</i>

701
00:31:52,212 --> 00:31:52,966
Yeah...

702
00:31:57,198 --> 00:31:58,733
Oh, of course I'll come.

703
00:31:58,885 --> 00:31:59,870
Where and when?

704
00:32:00,214 --> 00:32:01,009
Park Plaza.

705
00:32:01,515 --> 00:32:02,467
Meet you there at 8.

706
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:03,354
Alright?

707
00:32:04,286 --> 00:32:05,141
Look your prettiest.

708
00:32:05,351 --> 00:32:06,069
Alright.

709
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:07,478
I'll be there at 8.

710
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:08,562
Good bye.

711
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:10,843
Barry.

712
00:32:10,843 --> 00:32:11,478
Yeah?

713
00:32:11,623 --> 00:32:13,107
He wants me to have dinner with him.

714
00:32:13,203 --> 00:32:14,009
Do you mind?

715
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:16,989
Me? Mind? No certainly not, go right ahead.

716
00:32:16,989 --> 00:32:18,444
Oh, don't be that way.

717
00:32:18,465 --> 00:32:19,677
Well, how would you expect me to be?

718
00:32:19,677 --> 00:32:22,474
Happy, because you've broken a date with me to go out with another guy?

719
00:32:22,747 --> 00:32:24,432
Especially after you've been with him all afternoon.

720
00:32:24,578 --> 00:32:25,841
It isn't like that.

721
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:27,525
Oh, if you only knew.

722
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:29,182
Oh, please be sensible.

723
00:32:29,423 --> 00:32:31,484
Mallory isn't 'another guy', as you put it.

724
00:32:31,821 --> 00:32:33,811
He's a man who's going to be married in a week.

725
00:32:34,063 --> 00:32:35,396
He's in love with Lydia Hoyt.

726
00:32:35,848 --> 00:32:38,106
She has a headache and he's free for this evening.

727
00:32:38,376 --> 00:32:42,231
There won't be another chance and he's kind enough to give this evening to me and my worries.

728
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:45,405
It means a great deal to me, Barry. You know that.

729
00:32:45,927 --> 00:32:47,815
Doesn't that make any sense at all to you?

730
00:32:47,989 --> 00:32:49,214
Well, sure it makes sense.

731
00:32:49,432 --> 00:32:50,709
I haven't got a come-back.

732
00:32:50,992 --> 00:32:53,330
I can't find a floor in your argument anywhere.

733
00:32:53,711 --> 00:32:56,218
It's logical. It's convincing. It's reasonable.

734
00:32:56,218 --> 00:32:57,121
And it's sound.

735
00:32:57,413 --> 00:33:00,596
But just the same and nevertheless, I'm sore as a poisoned pup.

736
00:33:00,815 --> 00:33:02,776
That's masculine logic for you.

737
00:33:02,776 --> 00:33:05,637
Well, logic or no logic, if that guy makes a pass at you---

738
00:33:06,421 --> 00:33:07,637
Good evening, Mr. Mallory.

739
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:09,333
Good evening, Madame. Your table is ready.

740
00:33:09,353 --> 00:33:09,952
Thank you.

741
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:26,847
<i>Service pour deux.</i>

742
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,770
May I suggest the pompano sir.

743
00:33:28,813 --> 00:33:30,815
Strait from Palm Beach by plane this morning.

744
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,384
I'm going to leave it to you entirely,

745
00:33:32,456 --> 00:33:34,806
But remember, this is a very special occasion.

746
00:33:34,981 --> 00:33:35,847
Thank you, sir.

747
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:39,420
<i>[giving instruction in French]</i>

748
00:33:40,448 --> 00:33:41,455
What are you smiling at?

749
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:43,139
Not at anything.

750
00:33:43,165 --> 00:33:44,386
Just about everything.

751
00:33:44,487 --> 00:33:48,000
Let me be perfectly frank. I'm not altogether sorry that Lydia had a headache this evening.

752
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,200
What would Lydia do to you if she heard that?

753
00:33:50,434 --> 00:33:52,729
Well, I shudder to think. But don't misunderstand me.

754
00:33:52,729 --> 00:33:53,667
I don't!

755
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:56,798
It's just that it's so nice to have this evening alone with you, Kay.

756
00:33:57,424 --> 00:33:59,252
It's John Manly and Lydia!

757
00:33:59,926 --> 00:34:01,110
What's Lydia wearing?

758
00:34:03,078 --> 00:34:04,247
That isn't Lydia.

759
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,438
Stop squinting and eat your dinner.

760
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:08,760
Now,

761
00:34:09,074 --> 00:34:10,439
tell me all about yourself.

762
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:12,768
Where you live... how you live...

763
00:34:13,207 --> 00:34:14,275
who your friends are...

764
00:34:14,374 --> 00:34:15,600
how broke you are...

765
00:34:15,991 --> 00:34:17,094
I'm not broke. The money's holding out

766
00:34:17,363 --> 00:34:19,393
carefully budgeted.

767
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,688
The only trouble is

768
00:34:20,688 --> 00:34:22,873
the money and the budget 
don't seem to come out together

769
00:34:22,873 --> 00:34:24,454
at the end of the month.

770
00:34:24,592 --> 00:34:27,274
No Manly ever made a budget and lived up to it.

771
00:34:27,693 --> 00:34:29,857
You won't have to worry about that anymore, my dear.

772
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,325
You'll sprain your neck if you're not careful.

773
00:34:35,716 --> 00:34:37,845
I don't care. I think it's terrible.

774
00:34:37,845 --> 00:34:40,441
Three weeks until the wedding and he's out with another girl.

775
00:34:42,525 --> 00:34:44,019
You wouldn't be calling Lydia would you?

776
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,204
Don't be absurd.

777
00:34:45,448 --> 00:34:47,349
The nearest telephone is right out there.

778
00:35:12,085 --> 00:35:12,760
Hello.

779
00:35:13,036 --> 00:35:13,763
Lydia?

780
00:35:14,498 --> 00:35:16,411
Darling, this is Maude.

781
00:35:16,792 --> 00:35:17,350
<i>Who?</i>

782
00:35:17,535 --> 00:35:18,659
Maude, dear!

783
00:35:19,128 --> 00:35:20,622
Maude Rawly

784
00:35:20,674 --> 00:35:21,642
<i>Oh, hello.</i>

785
00:35:21,642 --> 00:35:22,828
Oh, aren't you well?

786
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,778
John and I are both worn out.

787
00:35:24,961 --> 00:35:26,290
We've been going so hard.

788
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:28,076
I'll be glad when the wedding's over.

789
00:35:28,117 --> 00:35:30,264
Oh, then everything is all right.

790
00:35:30,509 --> 00:35:32,559
Oh! I'm so relieved.

791
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:35,449
When I saw John come in with someone else

792
00:35:35,449 --> 00:35:37,409
<i>and someone so attractive, my dear</i>

793
00:35:37,409 --> 00:35:39,021
<i>I got positively jittery.</i>

794
00:35:39,115 --> 00:35:40,442
Why, where are you calling from?

795
00:35:40,666 --> 00:35:41,925
<i>The Park Plaza. But I did want to</i>

796
00:35:41,925 --> 00:35:44,134
<i>call up and find out if everything was all right.</i>

797
00:35:44,134 --> 00:35:47,176
<i>Of course, John was a sensation when he walked in, as usual--</i>

798
00:35:47,183 --> 00:35:47,801
Sarah!

799
00:35:48,221 --> 00:35:49,113
Sarah!!

800
00:35:50,136 --> 00:35:50,749
Yes, Miss?

801
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:51,766
I'm going out.

802
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:52,628
Yes, Miss.

803
00:35:53,431 --> 00:35:54,503
We've been very lucky.

804
00:35:54,503 --> 00:35:56,130
We've skipped all the bad parts.

805
00:35:56,553 --> 00:35:59,013
You've never had to lecture me because I flunked algebra.

806
00:35:59,055 --> 00:36:03,184
You've never had to decide about schools and report cards and taffeta party dresses.

807
00:36:03,445 --> 00:36:05,009
Whether I should bob my hair.

808
00:36:07,673 --> 00:36:08,769
Was he, Katherine?

809
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:10,925
He was the butcher's son.

810
00:36:10,925 --> 00:36:12,619
Oh ho, most undurable.

811
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:14,454
I haven't seen him since I was thirteen.

812
00:36:14,561 --> 00:36:15,979
And there hasn't been anyone since?

813
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,130
Oh, one or two...

814
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,207
One or two?

815
00:36:19,618 --> 00:36:20,591
Well, one.

816
00:36:20,899 --> 00:36:22,230
One at a time is enough.

817
00:36:22,377 --> 00:36:24,025
I thought it that way with my wives.

818
00:36:24,579 --> 00:36:26,054
You're very frank about it.

819
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:28,696
Well, I never take my wives too personally.

820
00:36:29,311 --> 00:36:32,809
I don't allow myself to become too deeply entrenched, because I hate to suffer.

821
00:36:33,226 --> 00:36:34,772
You see, I know so well in advance

822
00:36:34,772 --> 00:36:36,769
that the time is coming when they can't stand it any longer.

823
00:36:36,913 --> 00:36:38,143
They'll have to divorce me.

824
00:36:38,203 --> 00:36:39,351
It's self protection.

825
00:36:40,014 --> 00:36:43,682
Didn't it ever strike you to be so nice and faithful that they won't want to divorce you?

826
00:36:43,933 --> 00:36:44,982
I always think I am.

827
00:36:45,187 --> 00:36:46,139
Then something happens.

828
00:36:46,389 --> 00:36:48,406
But for Lydia, it's going to be different.

829
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:53,974
Good evening, Madame.

830
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:54,740
Good evening.

831
00:36:54,889 --> 00:36:56,184
Is Madame looking for someone?

832
00:36:56,252 --> 00:36:57,078
Why, yes, I--

833
00:36:57,524 --> 00:36:58,952
Nevermind. I found him.

834
00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:00,129
Shall we dance?

835
00:37:00,129 --> 00:37:00,952
I'd love to.

836
00:37:11,624 --> 00:37:12,398
Katherine,

837
00:37:12,485 --> 00:37:14,272
will you excuse me a moment, my dear?

838
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:16,843
I fear that I'm in a slight predicament.

839
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,102
Why, of course.

840
00:37:31,863 --> 00:37:33,020
Lydia, now wait a minute!

841
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,854
Let go of that door!

842
00:37:33,854 --> 00:37:35,936
Not until you promise to listen to me!
- I've listened to you for the last time.

843
00:37:35,936 --> 00:37:37,656
You're not going to make a fool out of me!

844
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:38,754
Lydia, this isn't like you! You're being foolish.

845
00:37:38,772 --> 00:37:40,976
I told you this afternoon I wouldn't tolerate your two-timing.

846
00:37:40,976 --> 00:37:41,791
Now let go of the door! 
-Please.

847
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,000
You're making a scene.
- Let go of that door or I'll scream.

848
00:37:44,007 --> 00:37:44,975
Mr. Mallory,

849
00:37:45,226 --> 00:37:47,074
Can I have your autograph?
 - Why, certainly.

850
00:37:47,122 --> 00:37:48,593
Oh, don't bother me!

851
00:37:49,766 --> 00:37:50,650
Sorry.

852
00:37:51,274 --> 00:37:52,647
Oh, please make up your mind!

853
00:37:52,952 --> 00:37:54,930
It's one side or the other! I've got to get out!

854
00:37:56,592 --> 00:37:57,559
Lydia!

855
00:37:57,565 --> 00:37:59,632
Lydia!! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

856
00:37:59,991 --> 00:38:01,278
Get me a cab quick! 
<i>-Taxi!</i>

857
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:03,545
Well, what are you staring at? I apologized didn't I?

858
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:06,896
Follow that cab, Mick!

859
00:38:38,354 --> 00:38:39,795
I'd better not wait any longer.

860
00:38:39,795 --> 00:38:41,120
Something must've happened.

861
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,451
Very good, Madame.

862
00:38:44,243 --> 00:38:45,548
Oh, but I was with Mr. Manion.

863
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,059
Oh, The Maitre D''hotel is gone for the night, Madame.

864
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,522
I am only a waiter.

865
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,594
I couldn't take the responsibility.

866
00:38:54,974 --> 00:38:56,522
21$!

867
00:38:57,215 --> 00:38:58,310
For chicken?

868
00:38:58,517 --> 00:39:01,144
<i>Poulet Tetrazini Garnes Aux Cloches</i>

869
00:39:01,412 --> 00:39:03,577
is not exactly chicken, Madame.

870
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:05,625
Well...

871
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,642
Could I use your phone?

872
00:39:07,886 --> 00:39:09,569
Why, certainly, Madame.

873
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:11,732
This way, please.

874
00:39:15,435 --> 00:39:16,096
Thank you.

875
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,468
Why, that's where the lift comes in.

876
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:30,476
Oh, all right. All right.

877
00:39:30,486 --> 00:39:31,422
So, I forgot the lift.

878
00:39:31,422 --> 00:39:33,201
What's the matter with you tonight?

879
00:39:33,231 --> 00:39:34,478
Well, it's 11 o'clock.

880
00:39:34,478 --> 00:39:36,743
Generally gets to be around this time.

881
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,164
We finally get a chance for a job--

882
00:39:39,164 --> 00:39:40,741
--But it was only a chance.

883
00:39:40,798 --> 00:39:42,663
Let's drop the whole thing for tonight, huh?

884
00:39:43,852 --> 00:39:45,595
You know she ought to be home by now.

885
00:39:46,191 --> 00:39:47,283
Well, that's it, huh?

886
00:39:48,202 --> 00:39:50,789
Still worried about Kay and the Big Bad Wolf?

887
00:39:51,879 --> 00:39:54,050
You act as though she were made of whipped cream.

888
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:57,992
Believe it or not, the city's a lot kinder to little girls from the country

889
00:39:57,992 --> 00:39:59,152
than it used to be.

890
00:39:59,724 --> 00:40:01,929
Especially, if they've got letters to the right people.

891
00:40:01,974 --> 00:40:04,425
Oh, it's easy enough for you to talk like that.

892
00:40:04,517 --> 00:40:05,482
You've been around.

893
00:40:05,555 --> 00:40:06,690
But Kay is different.

894
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,907
So, was I once.

895
00:40:08,671 --> 00:40:10,345
I had hay in my hair, too.

896
00:40:10,345 --> 00:40:13,010
But it shook out fast after two seasons at McCoys.

897
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:15,233
And no casualties either.

898
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:17,566
So, stop being a Rover boy.

899
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:19,584
I guess I do sound like that.

900
00:40:20,103 --> 00:40:23,658
But every time I think of her having dinner with that guy I could kick the ceiling off.

901
00:40:23,832 --> 00:40:25,228
So, that's the way it is, huh?

902
00:40:26,548 --> 00:40:28,062
I guess I'm silly, but...

903
00:40:29,068 --> 00:40:30,635
I've never been in love before.

904
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:31,558
No?

905
00:40:32,252 --> 00:40:33,806
I don't know whether I like it or not.

906
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,121
Who is it?

907
00:40:36,121 --> 00:40:38,190
Mr. Page, you're wanted on the phone.

908
00:40:38,262 --> 00:40:38,903
Thanks.

909
00:40:48,473 --> 00:40:49,315
Hello?

910
00:40:49,592 --> 00:40:50,187
Barry?

911
00:40:51,814 --> 00:40:52,535
It's Kay.

912
00:40:52,928 --> 00:40:55,864
Mr. Mallory was called away suddenly and I'm stuck with a check.

913
00:40:56,384 --> 00:40:57,426
21 dollars.

914
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,778
$21?

915
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,702
What did you have? Platinum pheasant stuffed with pearls?

916
00:41:02,088 --> 00:41:03,691
Oh, Barry, please be serious.

917
00:41:03,936 --> 00:41:05,160
Do you think you could raise it?

918
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,302
Yes, I guess so.

919
00:41:07,693 --> 00:41:10,549
I, um, may have to touch the landlady. What do I tell her?

920
00:41:12,986 --> 00:41:15,136
All right, honey. You sit tight. I'll be right over.

921
00:41:17,009 --> 00:41:18,394
Oh, Mrs. Megs?

922
00:41:19,037 --> 00:41:20,116
Yes, Mr. Page.

923
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,839
Can you let me have 20 dollars?

924
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,907
I cannot, Mr. Page.

925
00:41:24,227 --> 00:41:26,278
Well, it's for Kay. She's been in an accident.

926
00:41:26,529 --> 00:41:28,323
I'm very sorry, Mr. Page.

927
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,251
I trust it won't be fatal.

928
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:33,204
What's the matter, Barry?

929
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,390
Kay's in a jam. She needs 20 bucks.

930
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,662
Is she in jail?

931
00:41:36,662 --> 00:41:38,204
No, in the Park Plaza.

932
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,650
She's stuck with a check.

933
00:41:39,923 --> 00:41:42,747
I thought she went out with Mallory, the great picture star.

934
00:41:42,827 --> 00:41:44,914
She did. How much money do you girls got?

935
00:41:44,995 --> 00:41:46,206
Well, for all the nerve!

936
00:41:46,206 --> 00:41:47,301
See what Bergen's got.

937
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:49,412
It won't be money. I can tell you that much.

938
00:41:50,658 --> 00:41:51,433
Bergen!

939
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,200
Open up the penny bank. Show White's in trouble again.

940
00:42:21,474 --> 00:42:22,788
Good evening, Miss Martin.

941
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:24,868
Well, fancy meeting you here.

942
00:42:24,868 --> 00:42:25,542
Did you get it?

943
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:28,719
Oh, yes. I finally got it. I had to take up a collection to do it, though.

944
00:42:29,105 --> 00:42:32,697
Won't you join me in a cup of tea? I understand it's only 10 dollars a pot at this place.

945
00:42:32,753 --> 00:42:35,600
Oh, Barry. Please get me out. I've been sitting her for hours.

946
00:42:36,381 --> 00:42:36,892
Waiter!

947
00:42:36,892 --> 00:42:38,073
Yes, sir. Right away sir.

948
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,629
Five, ten, fifteen..

949
00:42:41,629 --> 00:42:42,900
twenty...

950
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:43,938
twenty-one. There you are.

951
00:42:44,014 --> 00:42:46,065
I deeply regret this inconvenience, sir.

952
00:42:46,118 --> 00:42:48,897
Of course, Miss Martin will never dine here again. You know that, don't you?

953
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:49,715
Never, sir?

954
00:42:49,912 --> 00:42:50,917
I was in hopes...

955
00:42:50,999 --> 00:42:53,084
Never under any circumstances. Come, dear.

956
00:43:02,815 --> 00:43:05,043
Oh, it was a nightmare sitting there.

957
00:43:05,263 --> 00:43:07,826
Well, uh, what do you suppose happened to his royal nebs?

958
00:43:07,913 --> 00:43:09,856
I'd rather not talk about it, Barry.

959
00:43:17,847 --> 00:43:18,792
Thanks, Barry.

960
00:43:18,792 --> 00:43:20,330
It was sweet of you to rescue me.

961
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,790
I'll pay you back in the morning.

962
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:23,611
And where will you get the money in the morning?

963
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,279
Oh, I have a little in the bank.

964
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,505
No!

965
00:43:29,167 --> 00:43:30,902
So, the lady has money in the bank.

966
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:33,056
The lady has money in the bank!

967
00:43:33,123 --> 00:43:33,851
Barry!

968
00:43:33,907 --> 00:43:35,111
What did he say?

969
00:43:35,273 --> 00:43:37,052
He said the lady has money in the bank.

970
00:43:38,038 --> 00:43:39,683
Silly!

971
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:41,203
Well, you have money in the bank.

972
00:43:44,226 --> 00:43:45,286
Shall we dance?

973
00:43:50,901 --> 00:43:53,089
Barry. What will people say?

974
00:43:53,302 --> 00:43:54,047
People?

975
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:56,520
Are there any other people in the world besides us?

976
00:44:06,848 --> 00:44:08,922
Just a minute, I have some unfinished business.

977
00:44:11,322 --> 00:44:12,329
Barry.

978
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:14,413
Barry!

979
00:44:17,742 --> 00:44:19,607
Say, what's the big idea?

980
00:44:19,684 --> 00:44:20,693
Gee, there's a cop! Come on!

981
00:44:20,693 --> 00:44:22,694
<i>Get back here, you.</i>

982
00:44:30,721 --> 00:44:31,795
Come on, in here.

983
00:44:34,543 --> 00:44:35,316
Is he after us?

984
00:44:35,316 --> 00:44:35,856
Who?

985
00:44:36,147 --> 00:44:36,678
The cop.

986
00:44:36,678 --> 00:44:37,671
Oh, he wasn't coming.

987
00:44:37,836 --> 00:44:38,646
Well, then, why?

988
00:44:38,646 --> 00:44:39,910
I thought you liked to run!

989
00:44:40,034 --> 00:44:41,143
Oh, you idiot.

990
00:44:41,143 --> 00:44:42,696
Oh, Kay, darling.

991
00:44:44,124 --> 00:44:44,821
I love you.

992
00:44:45,498 --> 00:44:46,683
We don't need any money.

993
00:44:47,001 --> 00:44:50,403
We don't fame. We don't need anything except the world for our shooting gallery.

994
00:44:51,437 --> 00:44:52,288
Will you marry me?

995
00:44:52,593 --> 00:44:53,993
If you really want me to.

996
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:57,285
We may not be able to eat a 20$ chicken dinner at the Plaza.

997
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:59,849
But a hot dog in Central Park is a lot more fun.

998
00:45:31,608 --> 00:45:33,246
Come on and talk to me, Charlie.

999
00:45:33,822 --> 00:45:34,858
I can't sleep.

1000
00:45:35,043 --> 00:45:36,076
I never sleep.

1001
00:45:36,502 --> 00:45:38,331
I can't even close my eyes.

1002
00:45:38,331 --> 00:45:39,045
I know.

1003
00:45:39,075 --> 00:45:40,937
I haven't been able to work that out, yet.

1004
00:45:41,014 --> 00:45:41,612
Oh.

1005
00:45:41,793 --> 00:45:44,595
There's a lot you haven't been able to work out, yet.

1006
00:45:45,181 --> 00:45:46,530
Such as, for instance.

1007
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:47,251
Well...

1008
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:48,866
Kay and Barry.

1009
00:45:49,567 --> 00:45:50,276
yes...

1010
00:45:51,473 --> 00:45:52,827
She's in love with him, Charlie

1011
00:45:53,018 --> 00:45:54,855
Why, tonight when she couldn't pay her check

1012
00:45:55,304 --> 00:45:56,527
he was the one she thought of.

1013
00:45:56,773 --> 00:45:59,533
Well, it could've been you if you weren't so tongue tied.

1014
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:02,163
Oh, I know. 
I could never think of the right word.

1015
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,743
I could. You should let me tell her.

1016
00:46:04,817 --> 00:46:07,601
Oh, I am sick and tired of you saying everything I want to.

1017
00:46:09,191 --> 00:46:10,187
What's that?

1018
00:46:29,073 --> 00:46:31,258
Where's number 217?

1019
00:46:31,258 --> 00:46:32,288
Over there.

1020
00:46:33,413 --> 00:46:36,259
See what I told you...

1021
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:36,905
No, no...

1022
00:46:36,905 --> 00:46:37,461
Go ahead.

1023
00:46:40,751 --> 00:46:42,829
[Bergen throws a deep voice to the horse.] 
 My, my...

1024
00:46:44,164 --> 00:46:45,206
Who said that?

1025
00:46:54,115 --> 00:46:55,851
[Horse voice]
 Uh-uh. Be careful.

1026
00:46:57,123 --> 00:46:58,368
Smart fellow, huh?

1027
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:08,110
Are you making noises at me, by any chance?

1028
00:47:08,195 --> 00:47:09,904
[Horse voice] 
Yeah, what are you going to do about it?

1029
00:47:10,819 --> 00:47:13,312
Egads! a talking horse!

1030
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,299
You're making too much noise down there.

1031
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:17,200
You're waking up the whole neighborhood.
 Will you keep quiet!

1032
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,755
Yeah, would you get along, Mister?

1033
00:47:19,784 --> 00:47:21,337
Oh, ho! A ventriloquist!

1034
00:47:22,167 --> 00:47:24,937
I think you're fine. I'm looking for Miss Kay Martin.

1035
00:47:25,228 --> 00:47:25,884
Kay Martin?

1036
00:47:26,661 --> 00:47:28,522
I believe she lives in this house.

1037
00:47:29,206 --> 00:47:30,660
Wait a minute. I'll be right down.

1038
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,418
Yeah, we'll be right down.

1039
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:54,862
Uh, don't look now, Bergen, but I think I picked up a splinter.

1040
00:47:55,562 --> 00:47:56,671
Wonder what he wants?

1041
00:47:57,705 --> 00:48:00,243
Ha ha, well, well...

1042
00:48:00,243 --> 00:48:01,599
Ah, he's wonderful!

1043
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,747
This is a strange time to be making a call.

1044
00:48:04,012 --> 00:48:05,094
But I'm not making a call.

1045
00:48:05,094 --> 00:48:07,506
I wouldn't come at this hour if wasn't important.

1046
00:48:07,506 --> 00:48:08,757
You better wait until later.

1047
00:48:08,757 --> 00:48:10,260
No, I want to see her now.

1048
00:48:10,284 --> 00:48:11,250
Well, alright.

1049
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:13,706
If you come up to my room, I'll see if I can get Miss Martin for you.

1050
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:15,201
What a funny little fellow.

1051
00:48:15,297 --> 00:48:17,458
You're quite amusing young man, you know that?

1052
00:48:17,755 --> 00:48:19,663
Shall I take a poke at him?

1053
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:22,473
Certainly not. The gentleman is paying you a compliment.

1054
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:23,635
Tell me.

1055
00:48:24,007 --> 00:48:25,019
How does it work??

1056
00:48:25,259 --> 00:48:26,957
Well, he doesn't. I do it all.

1057
00:48:26,957 --> 00:48:28,614
That's why neither of us work.

1058
00:48:29,812 --> 00:48:31,184
<i>Hahaha!</i>
 What's he laughing at?

1059
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:37,000
How did you get so cocked?

1060
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,468
I beg your pardon.

1061
00:48:38,468 --> 00:48:39,756
That's no way to talk to a stranger.

1062
00:48:39,756 --> 00:48:41,320
Oh, well let me put it another way.

1063
00:48:41,426 --> 00:48:43,250
If it isn't too embarrassing a question,

1064
00:48:43,317 --> 00:48:45,602
where, pray, did you get the snoot full?

1065
00:48:46,438 --> 00:48:47,896
Cute little fellow, eh?

1066
00:48:47,896 --> 00:48:49,849
If he said 'cute' I'll mow 'em down!

1067
00:48:49,849 --> 00:48:52,056
Easy, Charlie.
- I'll clip him, so help me!

1068
00:48:53,604 --> 00:48:55,130
Who do you suppose that is?

1069
00:48:55,938 --> 00:48:57,026
Sounds like Bergen.

1070
00:48:57,108 --> 00:48:59,758
I hope it's not the termites nibbling at Charlie.

1071
00:49:00,535 --> 00:49:03,017
For the love of Pete, what's all the racket?

1072
00:49:03,017 --> 00:49:04,343
What's going on here?

1073
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,383
Oh, this gentleman wants to see Kay.

1074
00:49:07,383 --> 00:49:09,062
Gentleman? Where's any gentleman?

1075
00:49:09,669 --> 00:49:11,922
Allow me to introduce myself, ladies.

1076
00:49:11,922 --> 00:49:13,295
My name is Mallory.

1077
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:14,822
John Mallory.

1078
00:49:15,538 --> 00:49:18,098
It's him, all right, and is he boiled!

1079
00:49:18,225 --> 00:49:19,786
Sorry, if I've disturbed you ladies.

1080
00:49:22,973 --> 00:49:23,539
Kay.

1081
00:49:23,879 --> 00:49:24,297
Kay!

1082
00:49:24,633 --> 00:49:24,982
Yes?

1083
00:49:25,145 --> 00:49:27,873
It's Edgar. John Mallory is downstairs and he wants to see you.

1084
00:49:28,101 --> 00:49:28,797
Wait a minute.

1085
00:49:32,388 --> 00:49:33,084
What did you say?

1086
00:49:33,084 --> 00:49:35,037
John Mallory's downstairs. He wants to see you.

1087
00:49:35,188 --> 00:49:36,097
John Mallory. Are you sure?

1088
00:49:36,533 --> 00:49:37,240
Are you sure?

1089
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,133
Positive.

1090
00:49:40,109 --> 00:49:43,898
Oh, Mr. Mallory, I haven't my album, but would you autograph my wall?

1091
00:49:48,096 --> 00:49:50,385
Oh, Katherine, dear, I...

1092
00:49:51,285 --> 00:49:51,925
Edgar

1093
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,852
may I use your room for a moment?

1094
00:49:53,852 --> 00:49:54,388
Certainly.

1095
00:49:54,443 --> 00:49:58,330
Well, there he is. You know Katherine, this is a great talent.

1096
00:49:58,586 --> 00:50:00,847
I thought that I'd seen everything in my life

1097
00:50:00,847 --> 00:50:03,421
and this is too extraordinary.
- Mr. Mallory!

1098
00:50:04,191 --> 00:50:05,485
May I speak to you alone?

1099
00:50:06,277 --> 00:50:07,710
Would you excuse us, please.

1100
00:50:18,952 --> 00:50:20,622
I owe you an apology.

1101
00:50:21,691 --> 00:50:23,570
You're disappointed in me, aren't you?

1102
00:50:24,052 --> 00:50:25,357
I don't know what to think.

1103
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:29,459
Would you like a cup of coffee?
- No, no. I'll be all right.

1104
00:50:30,741 --> 00:50:32,597
I shouldn't have come here like this tonight, but..

1105
00:50:33,245 --> 00:50:34,575
I wanted to explain.

1106
00:50:35,088 --> 00:50:36,120
Lydia saw us.

1107
00:50:36,238 --> 00:50:37,041
At the Plaza.

1108
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,458
We had a scene.

1109
00:50:39,491 --> 00:50:40,674
It's all over, Katherine.

1110
00:50:41,122 --> 00:50:41,864
Over?

1111
00:50:42,067 --> 00:50:43,046
Because of me?

1112
00:50:43,051 --> 00:50:43,529
Yes.

1113
00:50:44,864 --> 00:50:46,566
And you didn't tell her even then.

1114
00:50:46,755 --> 00:50:47,463
I couldn't.

1115
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,641
But why?

1116
00:50:48,859 --> 00:50:49,813
She wouldn't let me.

1117
00:50:50,479 --> 00:50:52,058
She wouldn't even listen to me.

1118
00:50:52,824 --> 00:50:54,133
Now that it's over

1119
00:50:54,627 --> 00:50:55,555
I don't care.

1120
00:50:56,067 --> 00:50:58,256
Well, some day you're going to hate me for this.

1121
00:50:58,786 --> 00:50:59,960
You'll wish I'd never come.

1122
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,203
Don't say that.

1123
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:07,932
Well, that's a sign of prosperity: more handkerchiefs than mirror space.

1124
00:51:08,844 --> 00:51:09,744
Come in.

1125
00:51:09,945 --> 00:51:10,939
Good morning, ladies.

1126
00:51:10,939 --> 00:51:11,953
Hiya, Barry!

1127
00:51:12,282 --> 00:51:13,660
We can have that booking in Pitsburg.

1128
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:14,705
Oh, swell!

1129
00:51:14,799 --> 00:51:16,174
Is Kay here?

1130
00:51:17,139 --> 00:51:17,915
No, she isn't.

1131
00:51:17,915 --> 00:51:19,079
I'll say she isn't.

1132
00:51:19,378 --> 00:51:20,100
Where is she?

1133
00:51:20,539 --> 00:51:21,323
She had to go out.

1134
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:22,882
I'll say she had to go out.

1135
00:51:23,014 --> 00:51:24,307
Out? Out where?

1136
00:51:24,384 --> 00:51:25,892
I don't know. She didn't tell me.

1137
00:51:27,864 --> 00:51:29,231
Say, what's going on here?

1138
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,612
Oh, don't mind us old boy. We didn't get much sleep last night.

1139
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:34,541
The traffic was terrific.

1140
00:51:35,031 --> 00:51:37,171
Come on, come on, Cora. What's on your mind?

1141
00:51:37,171 --> 00:51:40,116
My mind? No such thing, old boy. No such thing!

1142
00:51:41,577 --> 00:51:41,980
Honey.

1143
00:51:43,343 --> 00:51:44,436
What's she talking about?

1144
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,272
Mallory dropped in to see Kay.

1145
00:51:47,493 --> 00:51:48,116
Mallory?

1146
00:51:48,764 --> 00:51:49,347
When?

1147
00:51:49,399 --> 00:51:51,807
At 4 am, Mr. Crow-fly

1148
00:51:52,255 --> 00:51:53,422
He was a little tight.

1149
00:51:53,491 --> 00:51:54,710
Plastered.

1150
00:51:54,977 --> 00:51:58,703
Probably just wanted to apologize to Kay for leaving her at the Park Plaza.

1151
00:51:58,859 --> 00:52:00,166
At least, that's what we think.

1152
00:52:00,331 --> 00:52:02,697
Of course we couldn't hear much after they closed the door.

1153
00:52:02,941 --> 00:52:03,963
Kay took him home.

1154
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:05,369
Oh, she did!

1155
00:52:05,465 --> 00:52:07,511
It was the only thing she could do, Barry.

1156
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:16,755
Oh, my, my, my..

1157
00:52:16,755 --> 00:52:19,582
So, this is the way the idle rich live, huh?

1158
00:52:19,582 --> 00:52:20,222
Charlie!

1159
00:52:20,485 --> 00:52:23,148
You see, Bergen. If you were only a dramatic actor

1160
00:52:23,148 --> 00:52:24,680
we could have all this junk--

1161
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:25,690
---I mean,

1162
00:52:25,802 --> 00:52:27,764
Oh, Charlie. I worked very hard for all this.

1163
00:52:27,764 --> 00:52:32,412
Oh, come, come. All you do is mug a little and have a popular leading lady.

1164
00:52:32,509 --> 00:52:35,239
Andrews, some more coffee, please for Mr. Bergen and Mr. McCarthy.

1165
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:37,257
Yes, yes. Just put a hit on the saucer.

1166
00:52:40,409 --> 00:52:42,417
Putting on a little weight, aren't you, Andrews?

1167
00:52:42,506 --> 00:52:44,398
Yeah, oh! Well, excuse me...

1168
00:52:46,604 --> 00:52:50,110
That's quite all right, old fellow. I do it myself, sometimes.

1169
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:55,425
<i>No sense of humor at all. Ha ha</i>

1170
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,968
You know, Bergen, it's an outrage that the public doesn't know Charlie.

1171
00:53:00,067 --> 00:53:01,362
He ought to be working constantly.

1172
00:53:01,362 --> 00:53:02,465
That's what I say.

1173
00:53:02,465 --> 00:53:03,047
Well...

1174
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,525
We haven't worked for months.

1175
00:53:04,629 --> 00:53:06,888
But, I'm afraid ventriloquism is a thing of the past.

1176
00:53:07,073 --> 00:53:08,280
Well, I don't b--

1177
00:53:08,721 --> 00:53:09,367
Andrews!

1178
00:53:09,795 --> 00:53:11,410
Get Mr. Cummings at the Landstra on the telephone.

1179
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:12,157
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

1180
00:53:12,617 --> 00:53:14,331
Eh, Make it snappy, Andrews. Will you?

1181
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:15,846
What are you going to do?

1182
00:53:15,941 --> 00:53:18,113
I'm going to try to get Charlie the chance he deserves.

1183
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:19,593
Oh, that would be wonderful.

1184
00:53:19,593 --> 00:53:22,959
Did-did you hear that Bergen? Now, I don't want you to try to horn in on this thing, either.

1185
00:53:22,959 --> 00:53:24,226
<i> Mr. Cummings, please.</i>

1186
00:53:24,233 --> 00:53:25,679
Mr Cummings.

1187
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:26,965
Andrews, let me talk to him, please.

1188
00:53:29,624 --> 00:53:30,366
Hello, Tony

1189
00:53:30,604 --> 00:53:31,810
This is John Mallory talking.

1190
00:53:32,163 --> 00:53:34,130
Hey, Tony, uh... What is our next gamble?

1191
00:53:34,394 --> 00:53:35,028
Sunday week?

1192
00:53:35,035 --> 00:53:36,514
Oh, well that's splendid.

1193
00:53:36,961 --> 00:53:38,970
I've got a specialty act that I want you to put in.

1194
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:41,195
The name is Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy.

1195
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:43,251
That's all I'm going to tell you.

1196
00:53:43,515 --> 00:53:44,967
I'll let them talk for themselves.

1197
00:53:45,315 --> 00:53:46,384
When can you see them?

1198
00:53:47,592 --> 00:53:48,438
Well, uh

1199
00:53:48,693 --> 00:53:49,730
How long will you be there?

1200
00:53:50,459 --> 00:53:52,062
All right. I'll send them over.

1201
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:53,675
Thanks very much, Tony. Good bye.

1202
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:54,455
Right away?

1203
00:53:54,459 --> 00:53:55,114
No, there's no hurry.

1204
00:53:55,219 --> 00:53:57,711
Oh, that's what you think. Mr. Mallory. I can't begin to express-

1205
00:53:57,711 --> 00:53:59,232
--Well, I mean, after all, you're a stranger---

1206
00:53:59,232 --> 00:54:00,936
Eh, I mean-- Well, I hope that--

1207
00:54:00,936 --> 00:54:02,349
Why don't you let Charlie say it?

1208
00:54:02,353 --> 00:54:04,230
Yeah, what he's trying to say is, "Thanks".

1209
00:54:04,706 --> 00:54:06,245
And they call me a dummy.

1210
00:54:06,545 --> 00:54:08,643
I wonder if I could have some paper to wrap Charlie in?

1211
00:54:08,643 --> 00:54:09,682
Andrews, some paper, please.

1212
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:12,272
What's the idea of wrapping me up? What's- are you ashamed of me?

1213
00:54:14,218 --> 00:54:15,858
<i>Can't go out in broad daylight in a full-dress suit.</i>

1214
00:54:15,858 --> 00:54:17,450
<i>Pushed around.</i>

1215
00:54:17,492 --> 00:54:19,498
<i> I think we'd better wrap him up on the floor.</i>

1216
00:54:19,775 --> 00:54:22,158
On, the floor. In the alley. D'oh!

1217
00:54:22,193 --> 00:54:23,643
That's nice, thank you.
- I'm sorry.

1218
00:54:23,672 --> 00:54:26,162
Easy, easy Andrews. You're going to bust something.

1219
00:54:26,414 --> 00:54:27,526
Now if you'll bend your head...

1220
00:54:27,526 --> 00:54:30,541
Nuuu, no you don't! No, you don't, Bergen.

1221
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:31,696
Will you take his hat?
- Yes, sir.

1222
00:54:31,696 --> 00:54:33,337
Yeah. Well, give me a check on it.

1223
00:54:33,541 --> 00:54:34,855
It's a clip joint!

1224
00:54:34,945 --> 00:54:36,270
Will you move down here? 
- Uhyeah.

1225
00:54:36,681 --> 00:54:39,644
Yeow! Will you give me a pillow, Bergen?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1226
00:54:39,644 --> 00:54:42,016
I thought you better wrap up his feet first.

1227
00:54:42,162 --> 00:54:44,037
Pleasant idea, I'll take him with me.

1228
00:54:44,395 --> 00:54:45,366
Alright...

1229
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,433
What's this Bergen?

1230
00:54:46,447 --> 00:54:49,261
Judge refuses alimony. Oh now that's not it.

1231
00:54:49,275 --> 00:54:50,287
Easy with my legs there.

1232
00:54:50,354 --> 00:54:52,881
Oh you and... cut it out will you Andrews.

1233
00:54:53,887 --> 00:54:55,225
Just use the clippers in back here.

1234
00:54:55,238 --> 00:54:56,933
I don't know how to wrap him up.

1235
00:54:57,318 --> 00:54:59,402
Suppose you get down here and I'll wrap you up.

1236
00:54:59,417 --> 00:55:01,432
Oh! You're tickling. <i>Haha</i>

1237
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,658
<i>I feel so silly!</i>

1238
00:55:08,143 --> 00:55:09,531
Andrews:<i> I'll have him tied up in a minute, sir.</i>

1239
00:55:09,831 --> 00:55:11,345
You're terribly sweet to do this.

1240
00:55:11,626 --> 00:55:12,613
I appreciate it.

1241
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:13,967
Am I forgiven?

1242
00:55:14,385 --> 00:55:15,020
For what?

1243
00:55:15,369 --> 00:55:16,245
For last night.

1244
00:55:16,554 --> 00:55:17,604
Well, of course.

1245
00:55:24,328 --> 00:55:28,059
<i>Hey, you're pinching me! Let go. I can't breathe. Ouch!</i>

1246
00:55:28,385 --> 00:55:30,498
<i>Dirty, double crossing, good for nothing--</i>

1247
00:55:30,498 --> 00:55:32,610
Well I'd better run along before the real language starts!

1248
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:34,023
<i>Say, you haven't heard anything yet!</i>

1249
00:55:34,179 --> 00:55:35,326
Good bye old-timer!

1250
00:55:35,447 --> 00:55:36,671
Good luck! 
<i>-Thanks!</i>

1251
00:55:36,702 --> 00:55:38,956
Charlie:<i> Good bye, Kay. Au revoir, Mr. Mallory.</i>

1252
00:55:38,956 --> 00:55:41,372
<i>I'll give you a ring tonight if I can get away from Bergen.</i>

1253
00:55:44,161 --> 00:55:44,797
Thank you.

1254
00:55:44,797 --> 00:55:45,435
Good bye.

1255
00:55:45,435 --> 00:55:46,371
<i>Eh, Good bye. Good bye.</i>

1256
00:55:46,404 --> 00:55:47,803
<i>Who am I saying good bye to?
-</i> Andrews.

1257
00:55:47,949 --> 00:55:48,784
<i>Oh, Andrews.</i>

1258
00:55:50,841 --> 00:55:52,257
Quiet.

1259
00:55:52,387 --> 00:55:54,230
<i>What are we waiting for?</i>
- We're waiting for the elevator.

1260
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:54,905
Will you please shut-up?

1261
00:55:54,905 --> 00:55:57,214
<i>Well, how am I supposed to know? I can't see.</i>

1262
00:55:59,444 --> 00:56:00,522
Hello, Bergen!

1263
00:56:00,522 --> 00:56:01,773
Will you get down, there!

1264
00:56:02,694 --> 00:56:03,963
Just peeking.
- All right.

1265
00:56:05,079 --> 00:56:06,343
Down?
- Down, yes. Yes.

1266
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:09,191
<i>Yea, down and out. Take it easy, buddy. I got a weak heart.</i>

1267
00:56:12,361 --> 00:56:13,497
Which is Mallory's apartment?

1268
00:56:13,595 --> 00:56:14,815
Right across the hall, sir.

1269
00:56:26,757 --> 00:56:27,264
Yes, sir?

1270
00:56:27,264 --> 00:56:28,309
I want to see Mr. Mallory.

1271
00:56:28,309 --> 00:56:29,496
Are you expected?
- No.

1272
00:56:29,524 --> 00:56:31,523
Mr. Mallory sees no one except by appointment.

1273
00:56:31,632 --> 00:56:32,331
I'm sorry, sir.

1274
00:56:32,331 --> 00:56:34,931
Well, you tell him it's very important. I've got to see him right away.

1275
00:56:35,265 --> 00:56:37,456
I beg your pardon, sir!

1276
00:56:38,907 --> 00:56:41,751
If you'll be good enough to sit down, sir. I'll see what I can do.

1277
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,357
I beg your pardon, sir. There's a gentleman who insists on seeing you.

1278
00:56:52,363 --> 00:56:53,446
Mallory: <i>Will you pardon me, dear?</i>

1279
00:56:53,446 --> 00:56:54,384
<i>Of course.</i>

1280
00:56:55,514 --> 00:56:57,573
What's his name?
- I didn't quite get it, sir.

1281
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,655
Andrews, if you've let in another process server, I'll have your hide!

1282
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:08,432
Good morning.

1283
00:57:08,704 --> 00:57:09,654
Mr. Mallory.

1284
00:57:09,934 --> 00:57:10,907
Yes, what can I do for you?

1285
00:57:11,018 --> 00:57:11,860
Where is she?

1286
00:57:12,398 --> 00:57:13,546
She? Who?

1287
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:15,369
Mr. John Mallory!

1288
00:57:16,675 --> 00:57:17,897
The great movie actor.

1289
00:57:20,109 --> 00:57:24,071
The guy that's so marvelous that all the women fall in love with so easily.

1290
00:57:25,061 --> 00:57:27,480
Well, I'm glad that I finally got a good look at you!

1291
00:57:27,496 --> 00:57:28,281
What is this?

1292
00:57:28,555 --> 00:57:32,537
All my life I've had an insane desire to twist your nose! 
- OW!

1293
00:57:32,537 --> 00:57:34,960
OW, LET GO! OHW!
- Charming!

1294
00:57:35,191 --> 00:57:37,731
OW! Shout for the police!
- Don't you look great? 
-

1295
00:57:37,731 --> 00:57:39,328
Help! You'll ruin my face!

1296
00:57:39,347 --> 00:57:41,682
Andrews! Help!!
- Barry!

1297
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:44,510
Barry!

1298
00:57:45,456 --> 00:57:47,379
Oh, you poor darling!
- Aoohw.

1299
00:57:47,518 --> 00:57:49,094
Oh, Barry. How could you?

1300
00:57:50,168 --> 00:57:51,779
So, you know this ruffian!

1301
00:57:52,227 --> 00:57:54,108
I'll have you in jail for this.

1302
00:57:54,406 --> 00:57:55,885
Get out of my apartment!

1303
00:57:58,425 --> 00:58:00,278
Oh, Barry! What have you done?

1304
00:58:00,306 --> 00:58:02,535
Spoiled the old peacock's face for him, I hope.

1305
00:58:02,678 --> 00:58:04,550
Oh you stupid fool!

1306
00:58:04,578 --> 00:58:05,685
So, that's how it is!

1307
00:58:06,432 --> 00:58:08,972
He's a poor darling and I'm a stupid fool.

1308
00:58:11,756 --> 00:58:12,465
Barry!

1309
00:58:12,748 --> 00:58:13,751
Barry, wait!

1310
00:58:27,358 --> 00:58:28,796
It's turning blue!

1311
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:34,416
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1312
00:58:34,593 --> 00:58:36,609
Let me look at it.
No, no, no, no. Don't touch it!

1313
00:58:36,841 --> 00:58:38,262
Does it hurt?

1314
00:58:38,384 --> 00:58:41,052
I..I shall consider myself very fortunate if I'm not disfigured for life.

1315
00:58:41,194 --> 00:58:42,812
Oh, he must have been out of his mind!

1316
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,767
Tell me. Who was that gangster?

1317
00:58:44,767 --> 00:58:46,106
Oh, he's not a gangster.

1318
00:58:46,455 --> 00:58:48,902
He's Barry Page, the boy I told you about last night.

1319
00:58:49,142 --> 00:58:50,191
We're going to be married.

1320
00:58:51,154 --> 00:58:51,875
Married!

1321
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:52,375
Yes...

1322
00:58:52,894 --> 00:58:55,277
Well, things are happening!

1323
00:58:56,149 --> 00:58:57,847
Yesterday, I discovered I was a father.

1324
00:58:58,517 --> 00:59:00,031
Today I'm to be a Father-in-law.

1325
00:59:01,225 --> 00:59:03,215
And in a year, all things being equal,

1326
00:59:03,659 --> 00:59:04,799
I'll be a grandfather!

1327
00:59:06,051 --> 00:59:08,689
If you'll excuse me, I'll try to catch Barry and explain.

1328
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:09,968
Explain what?

1329
00:59:09,969 --> 00:59:11,279
That you're my father.

1330
00:59:11,392 --> 00:59:14,481
Why, I couldn't let him go on thinking what he does about me, could I?

1331
00:59:14,993 --> 00:59:15,906
Oh, yes.

1332
00:59:16,354 --> 00:59:17,788
I'll be back in a little while.

1333
00:59:31,093 --> 00:59:32,360
I'm finished, Andrews.

1334
00:59:32,879 --> 00:59:33,694
It's all over.

1335
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,802
I couldn't stop her. She's going to tell.

1336
00:59:37,068 --> 00:59:37,784
Tell what, sir?

1337
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:38,986
You'll know soon enough.

1338
00:59:39,636 --> 00:59:40,655
Read the morning papers.

1339
00:59:40,948 --> 00:59:43,166
Read Beachel. Read Skolski and see how they laugh at me.

1340
00:59:43,191 --> 00:59:45,266
But what have you done, sir. I don't understand.

1341
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:47,558
Don't you know that it's a crime to stay young?

1342
00:59:48,143 --> 00:59:49,152
How old am I, Andrews?

1343
00:59:49,384 --> 00:59:50,181
How old do I look?

1344
00:59:50,189 --> 00:59:51,726
Not a day over 35, sir.

1345
00:59:51,885 --> 00:59:52,792
Liar!

1346
00:59:54,608 --> 00:59:55,578
I'm 52.

1347
00:59:56,035 --> 00:59:59,470
And tomorrow every housewife in America is going to read it over her morning coffee.

1348
01:00:00,973 --> 01:00:02,553
Get me a cup and make it strong.

1349
01:00:02,676 --> 01:00:03,317
Yes, sir.

1350
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:08,152
Oh, Honey.

1351
01:00:08,875 --> 01:00:09,892
Oh, hello, Barry.

1352
01:00:10,164 --> 01:00:10,767
Where are you going?

1353
01:00:10,785 --> 01:00:12,268
Up to the corner for a cup of coffee.

1354
01:00:12,287 --> 01:00:13,210
Come on, I'll go with you.

1355
01:00:16,885 --> 01:00:17,827
Anything wrong, Barry?

1356
01:00:17,827 --> 01:00:18,869
No. Nothing.

1357
01:00:19,594 --> 01:00:21,056
You think we can still get that booking?

1358
01:00:21,194 --> 01:00:23,392
Maybe. If we can make Pittsburgh by tomorrow.

1359
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:24,072
We can make it.

1360
01:00:24,316 --> 01:00:26,877
You pack and I'll run down, pick up the tickets and sign the contract.

1361
01:00:26,877 --> 01:00:29,454
But Barry, why in the world are you trying--
- Now, don't ask a lot of questions!

1362
01:00:30,181 --> 01:00:32,477
I just want to get out of this town as quickly as possible.

1363
01:00:32,509 --> 01:00:33,966
You haven't killed anyone, have you?

1364
01:00:34,615 --> 01:00:36,034
What's the matter? Don't you wanna go?

1365
01:00:36,069 --> 01:00:37,544
Sure! If you want to.

1366
01:00:37,748 --> 01:00:39,790
Anything you want is okay with me.

1367
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:42,648
It's always been like that, hasn't it?

1368
01:00:42,784 --> 01:00:43,751
Kay was right.

1369
01:00:43,751 --> 01:00:45,174
She said you were--
--Said I was what?

1370
01:00:45,873 --> 01:00:47,106
She said you were in love with me.

1371
01:00:47,582 --> 01:00:48,445
What if I were?

1372
01:00:48,994 --> 01:00:50,154
S'pose I told you that

1373
01:00:50,708 --> 01:00:52,207
I thought the same way about you?

1374
01:00:52,622 --> 01:00:53,780
I'd say you're a liar.

1375
01:00:53,899 --> 01:00:55,357
All right, so I'm a liar.

1376
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,440
Would you marry me?

1377
01:00:57,667 --> 01:01:00,805
Barry, have you forgotten that last night you told me that you're in love with Kay?

1378
01:01:00,825 --> 01:01:01,885
That was last night.

1379
01:01:02,375 --> 01:01:05,156
I realize now what a class-A sap I've been.

1380
01:01:05,505 --> 01:01:07,772
Looking for something real when I had it all the time.

1381
01:01:08,602 --> 01:01:10,699
Maybe I needed a good, swift kick to find it out.

1382
01:01:11,395 --> 01:01:12,656
Barry, do you really mean it?

1383
01:01:13,024 --> 01:01:14,894
Now, what do you want me to do? Stand on my head?

1384
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:16,318
Honey,

1385
01:01:17,537 --> 01:01:19,181
from now on it's you and me. Remember that.

1386
01:01:19,802 --> 01:01:21,399
Nobody else.

1387
01:01:22,774 --> 01:01:23,482
Get your coffee.

1388
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:24,459
Where are you going?

1389
01:01:24,757 --> 01:01:27,094
I'm going to get us booked before you change your mind.

1390
01:01:38,144 --> 01:01:38,904
Come in.

1391
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:41,320
Honey, have you seen Barry?

1392
01:01:41,585 --> 01:01:43,100
Yes, I just left him.

1393
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,535
I've got to see him.

1394
01:01:44,847 --> 01:01:45,465
Where is he?

1395
01:01:45,593 --> 01:01:46,576
Gone to see an agent

1396
01:01:46,614 --> 01:01:47,538
about a job.

1397
01:01:47,994 --> 01:01:49,008
We're going on the road.

1398
01:01:49,527 --> 01:01:50,903
I'm packing now for both of us.

1399
01:01:51,437 --> 01:01:53,340
Just like old times, only better!

1400
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:56,592
Kay, do me a favor, will you and drag that suitcase out from under the bed?

1401
01:01:58,506 --> 01:01:59,219
Kay,

1402
01:02:00,178 --> 01:02:01,159
Kay, what do you think?

1403
01:02:01,966 --> 01:02:03,065
He asked me to marry him!

1404
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:06,584
After being together 5 years, suddenly he asks me.

1405
01:02:07,074 --> 01:02:07,898
Just like that!

1406
01:02:08,214 --> 01:02:09,517
You could've knocked me over.

1407
01:02:10,358 --> 01:02:11,326
When did this happen?

1408
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:12,109
Just now.

1409
01:02:12,956 --> 01:02:15,263
I wonder what Cora did with that clean laundry?

1410
01:02:17,003 --> 01:02:20,021
I don't mind telling you, I was pretty scared when you came along.

1411
01:02:21,257 --> 01:02:22,637
I thought he was nuts about you!

1412
01:02:22,773 --> 01:02:24,250
It's funny how things turned out.

1413
01:02:24,287 --> 01:02:27,567
One minute you want to take poison and the next you're singing like a Canary.

1414
01:02:28,948 --> 01:02:31,787
You must think I'm crazy carrying on like this

1415
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,592
but I think it's swell when two people are married and work together.

1416
01:02:36,096 --> 01:02:38,538
I'd give my life to put Barry up where he belongs.

1417
01:02:38,968 --> 01:02:41,936
I think, I dream, I pray for his success.

1418
01:02:42,401 --> 01:02:43,548
It's all I care about.

1419
01:02:44,935 --> 01:02:46,487
Well, of course with you it's something else again.

1420
01:02:46,487 --> 01:02:48,779
You've got your own career. Not to mention Mallory!

1421
01:02:49,386 --> 01:02:50,847
You don't have to explain, Honey.

1422
01:02:51,712 --> 01:02:53,586
I wish you all the happiness in the world.

1423
01:02:53,769 --> 01:02:54,460
Both of you.

1424
01:03:20,274 --> 01:03:21,741
Shall we go inside?
- I'd love to.

1425
01:03:22,041 --> 01:03:22,890
Rick, how are you?

1426
01:03:22,979 --> 01:03:25,705
John! How are you?
- You needn't bother about us. We know everybody.

1427
01:03:25,724 --> 01:03:27,472
All right, I'll see you later.

1428
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:29,803
Katherine, I want you to meet Mr. Tucker.

1429
01:03:29,959 --> 01:03:31,511
This is my protege, Miss Katherine Martin.

1430
01:03:31,567 --> 01:03:33,545
Simply everybody in New York is here.

1431
01:03:33,545 --> 01:03:35,289
Everybody wants to see what she looks like.

1432
01:03:35,647 --> 01:03:36,812
He can still pick 'em.

1433
01:03:36,906 --> 01:03:38,444
I wish you all the luck in the world.

1434
01:03:38,487 --> 01:03:40,156
Oh, thank you.
- And he means it, too.

1435
01:03:40,156 --> 01:03:41,126
Indeed, I do!

1436
01:03:41,181 --> 01:03:42,680
Excuse me a moment, please.
- Certainly.

1437
01:03:42,713 --> 01:03:45,161
Cora, I'm so glad you came. I thought you'd deserted us.

1438
01:03:45,201 --> 01:03:46,148
Not me.

1439
01:03:46,185 --> 01:03:46,977
Cora!

1440
01:03:47,109 --> 01:03:48,423
You're looking lovelier than ever.

1441
01:03:48,423 --> 01:03:49,193
Thank you!

1442
01:03:50,083 --> 01:03:51,337
What's going on in there?

1443
01:03:51,377 --> 01:03:53,654
Charlie McCarthy is causing a riot among the guests.

1444
01:03:54,254 --> 01:03:57,449
Say, fine thing not allowing women at the Lamb's Gamble

1445
01:03:57,641 --> 01:04:00,399
I'd have given anything to have seen Charlie mow 'em down!

1446
01:04:00,399 --> 01:04:01,034
Now, listen.

1447
01:04:01,377 --> 01:04:02,579
I'm going to tell you a secret.

1448
01:04:03,091 --> 01:04:05,527
Rudy Vallee was there and he was so impressed with Bergen

1449
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:08,206
That he's invited him to appear as a guest star on his radio program.

1450
01:04:08,268 --> 01:04:10,683
Good heavens! What's a dummy going to do on the air?

1451
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,982
Never you mind. I have complete faith in Charlie.

1452
01:04:22,411 --> 01:04:23,824
<i>I don't think that's funny.</i>

1453
01:04:23,824 --> 01:04:24,813
You don't!

1454
01:04:26,346 --> 01:04:30,048
Oh, people, people, people. I've never seen so many faces!

1455
01:04:30,121 --> 01:04:32,248
Such a distinguished looking mob, too!

1456
01:04:32,395 --> 01:04:35,373
Charlie, we're mingling with the cream of society today.

1457
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:36,972
The cream?
- Yes, indeed.

1458
01:04:37,098 --> 01:04:37,777
What do you mean?

1459
01:04:37,777 --> 01:04:40,358
Why, you know. The cream, eh, floats on top.

1460
01:04:40,659 --> 01:04:42,257
Oh, yeah. Yeah...

1461
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:44,781
So does scum!
- Eh? Well...

1462
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:50,282
Will you excuse me, please?

1463
01:04:50,282 --> 01:04:51,050
Of course.

1464
01:04:53,147 --> 01:04:54,514
Isn't this something?

1465
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:57,441
Not much like the old boarding house on 45th street is it?

1466
01:04:57,481 --> 01:04:59,725
Oh, I'd miss 45th street if I weren't so busy.

1467
01:04:59,774 --> 01:05:01,143
You're lucky to be away from it.

1468
01:05:01,385 --> 01:05:04,131
It's like a morgue since you and Honey and Barry left.

1469
01:05:04,635 --> 01:05:06,683
I expect Bergen will be checking out next.

1470
01:05:07,085 --> 01:05:08,000
Heard from Honey lately?

1471
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,499
Had a letter yesterday. They've been held over in Buffalo.

1472
01:05:10,551 --> 01:05:11,834
Oh, I'm glad!

1473
01:05:13,459 --> 01:05:14,844
Have they, uh, been married, yet?

1474
01:05:15,092 --> 01:05:17,811
No. Honey wants to wait until they play her home town.

1475
01:05:18,929 --> 01:05:20,687
<i>Hahah
- I'm just crazy about you!</i>

1476
01:05:22,804 --> 01:05:24,410
Well, she's sober. She's...

1477
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:26,599
Eh, tell me some more.

1478
01:05:26,599 --> 01:05:27,900
I want to be your friend.

1479
01:05:27,948 --> 01:05:28,610
Mhmm.

1480
01:05:28,846 --> 01:05:31,856
Well, you could be my friend if you'd do me a little favor.

1481
01:05:32,027 --> 01:05:33,654
Oh, I'd love to. What is it?

1482
01:05:33,654 --> 01:05:36,854
Would you, eh, loan me 50 cents until Wednesday?

1483
01:05:36,909 --> 01:05:38,581
No. No, I couldn't do that.

1484
01:05:38,637 --> 01:05:40,006
Eh, Tuesday?

1485
01:05:40,056 --> 01:05:40,918
Til Monday?

1486
01:05:40,972 --> 01:05:41,438
No.

1487
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:45,074
What's going on here? You don't mean to tell me that you're trying to borrow money from this lady!

1488
01:05:45,176 --> 01:05:47,585
Well, I- I didn't mean to tell you, no.

1489
01:05:47,617 --> 01:05:50,259
No.
- No and worse than that, I didn't get it.
- Oh, I see.<i>
 Hahaha</i>

1490
01:05:50,687 --> 01:05:53,006
Well, I'm glad you didn't give it to him!
- Yes.

1491
01:05:53,152 --> 01:05:55,255
And that reminds me, young man!
- What?

1492
01:05:55,323 --> 01:05:57,534
I left a quarter on my dresser this morning,

1493
01:05:57,592 --> 01:05:58,516
Yeah?
- Yes.

1494
01:05:58,670 --> 01:06:00,719
And when I came back, the quarter was gone.

1495
01:06:00,856 --> 01:06:02,012
It was?
- Yes.

1496
01:06:02,075 --> 01:06:04,141
And we are the only two people up there.

1497
01:06:04,181 --> 01:06:06,760
Well, there's always, eh... there's eh...

1498
01:06:07,256 --> 01:06:08,862
Mr. Bergen!<i>
 Hahaha</i>

1499
01:06:08,928 --> 01:06:10,959
Do you realiiiize what you've said?

1500
01:06:10,959 --> 01:06:12,061
Yes, I do!

1501
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,014
Do you realiiiize what you've done?

1502
01:06:14,014 --> 01:06:14,647
I do!

1503
01:06:14,647 --> 01:06:16,034
Well, that's the last straw!

1504
01:06:16,034 --> 01:06:18,842
The man has called me a common thief!
- Now listen, Charlie.

1505
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,848
If I've made a mistake--
- Oh, there's nothing you can do!

1506
01:06:20,848 --> 01:06:23,744
I want to apologi--
 --there's nothing you can DO Mr. Bergen!

1507
01:06:23,834 --> 01:06:25,215
And the- the wrong is done!

1508
01:06:25,215 --> 01:06:26,644
Now, listen---
- DO DO DO!

1509
01:06:26,644 --> 01:06:28,842
Listen, Charlie! I'll be glad to apologize---
- DOOO DO DO!

1510
01:06:30,985 --> 01:06:32,025
There's nothing you can do!

1511
01:06:32,025 --> 01:06:34,014
All right. I'm sorry! I want to apologize!

1512
01:06:34,035 --> 01:06:34,951
You do?
- Yes,

1513
01:06:34,951 --> 01:06:36,348
I really don't think you took it.

1514
01:06:36,437 --> 01:06:38,450
Don't you think I took it?
- I don't think so.

1515
01:06:38,519 --> 01:06:40,228
Uh-uh.
- And I want to apologize.

1516
01:06:40,385 --> 01:06:41,134
You do?
- Yes.

1517
01:06:41,409 --> 01:06:42,350
Will you forgive me?

1518
01:06:42,509 --> 01:06:45,258
Uh. Uhhhh, well you won't mention it again?

1519
01:06:45,258 --> 01:06:46,853
I'll never mention it again.

1520
01:06:46,992 --> 01:06:49,959
A-all right. I'll forgive you.
- Thank you. 
- Yes.

1521
01:06:50,279 --> 01:06:53,614
Now, that it's all settled, is it all right for me to keep the quarter?

1522
01:06:53,614 --> 01:06:55,231
Well...
<i> Hahahaha</i>

1523
01:06:55,687 --> 01:06:57,335
I don't think that's very funny.

1524
01:06:57,335 --> 01:06:58,173
You don't?
-No.

1525
01:06:58,394 --> 01:06:59,958
Well, then why did you make me say it?

1526
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:00,755
Oh, I see.

1527
01:07:02,576 --> 01:07:03,930
That kills him.
- Yes, em...

1528
01:07:07,149 --> 01:07:09,271
You're not so clever either, Mr. Bergen.

1529
01:07:09,271 --> 01:07:09,960
Oh, I'm not?

1530
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:10,510
No.

1531
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:11,868
I can see your lips moving.

1532
01:07:11,868 --> 01:07:13,359
<i>Hahaha
- Oh, you do?!</i>

1533
01:07:13,642 --> 01:07:14,956
That burns him up, you know. 
<i>Hahahaha</i>

1534
01:07:16,944 --> 01:07:17,558
Yes.

1535
01:07:17,593 --> 01:07:19,691
I'll hear about this when I get home.
<i>Hahaha</i>

1536
01:07:21,138 --> 01:07:22,612
Yes, you will.

1537
01:07:23,364 --> 01:07:24,796
Well, I'm sorry about that.

1538
01:07:24,796 --> 01:07:26,079
Will you watch it, please?!

1539
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,327
I will watch it. Yes.

1540
01:07:27,327 --> 01:07:28,729
Yes. It spoils the illusion.

1541
01:07:28,729 --> 01:07:29,790
Yes, I know.

1542
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:32,414
After all, there's no use of us BOTH being dummies!

1543
01:07:32,461 --> 01:07:33,525
<i>Hahahaha
</i>- No, I...

1544
01:07:36,289 --> 01:07:38,626
Well, he's still got them laughing, hasn't he?

1545
01:07:38,791 --> 01:07:42,636
The Great Mr. Bergen. The ventriloquist here.

1546
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:44,140
Why you went out with the Bustle.

1547
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:45,869
Aall right!
<i>hahaha</i>

1548
01:07:50,056 --> 01:07:51,778
I can do that stuff myself.

1549
01:07:51,778 --> 01:07:53,246
What are you doing down there, George?

1550
01:07:53,246 --> 01:07:54,404
[Charlie throwing his voice.]
<i>"Oh, something old!"
<i>Hahahahah</i></i>

1551
01:07:59,046 --> 01:08:00,102
Now, go ahead. Top it!

1552
01:08:00,102 --> 01:08:01,416
Yeah, all right. All right.

1553
01:08:01,423 --> 01:08:03,292
Well,
- Where would you be without me?

1554
01:08:03,292 --> 01:08:05,034
Yeah, well, where would you be without me?

1555
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:06,597
Yeah? Well, you got me there.

1556
01:08:06,597 --> 01:08:08,240
Yes, well I'll show you where I would be.

1557
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,576
You'd be selling papers.

1558
01:08:09,576 --> 01:08:10,826
Oh, no, I wouldn't! Now,

1559
01:08:10,982 --> 01:08:11,865
sit right over there!
- Oh!

1560
01:08:11,865 --> 01:08:13,815
That's right. Kick me in the face!

1561
01:08:14,326 --> 01:08:15,901
Mortimer! Mortimer!

1562
01:08:15,959 --> 01:08:17,174
Morton.
 - Yeuh, yup.

1563
01:08:17,174 --> 01:08:18,966
Come right up here.

1564
01:08:18,972 --> 01:08:21,071
<i>Hahaha</i>

1565
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:23,123
Would you like to meet these people?

1566
01:08:23,123 --> 01:08:25,344
Naw, no, no.

1567
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:27,367
There's some very charming girls here.

1568
01:08:27,404 --> 01:08:29,126
Awww,!

1569
01:08:31,777 --> 01:08:32,420
This is Charlie.

1570
01:08:32,531 --> 01:08:34,636
Yaaww...

1571
01:08:34,658 --> 01:08:35,738
Isn't he funny?

1572
01:08:35,823 --> 01:08:36,595
Disgusting.

1573
01:08:36,595 --> 01:08:38,619
All right.

1574
01:08:41,073 --> 01:08:42,646
Mortimer. What is your last name?

1575
01:08:42,646 --> 01:08:44,096
What?
- I said, what is your last name?

1576
01:08:44,812 --> 01:08:45,994
Who me?
- Yes, you.

1577
01:08:46,183 --> 01:08:47,140
Mortimer...

1578
01:08:47,212 --> 01:08:48,750
Mortimer.
- Yes. That's your first name.

1579
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,026
Yeup, yup, yup, yup

1580
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:52,701
Eh, Mortimer, uh...

1581
01:08:52,701 --> 01:08:53,969
All right, the last name.

1582
01:08:54,221 --> 01:08:55,905
Mortimer, phh...

1583
01:08:56,112 --> 01:08:56,959
Uh...

1584
01:08:57,027 --> 01:08:57,557
Mortimer!

1585
01:08:57,557 --> 01:09:00,490
Yeah. Well, that's the first name.
- Yeah, that's the first name. Stupid.

1586
01:09:00,535 --> 01:09:02,525
Mortimerrr... phh...

1587
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,512
Oh, come on! Don't you know your last name?

1588
01:09:04,512 --> 01:09:06,230
Well, I'm working on it!<i>
Hahaha</i>

1589
01:09:09,490 --> 01:09:10,596
Come on!

1590

Mortimer...

1591
01:09:16,499 --> 01:09:17,210
Ssnerd!

1592

Mortimer Snerd!

1593
01:09:18,104 --> 01:09:20,105
Yea ha ha ha

1594
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:21,760
That's mean all right!

1595
01:09:21,833 --> 01:09:23,630
Yes. Well, uh, are you a city boy?

1596
01:09:23,765 --> 01:09:25,319
No. I'm a country boy.

1597
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:25,962
A country boy.

1598
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:26,976
You work on a farm?

1599
01:09:26,976 --> 01:09:28,051
Yeup, yup, yup

1600
01:09:28,051 --> 01:09:28,887
What do you raise?

1601
01:09:28,984 --> 01:09:31,587
Oh, corn, potatoes and stuff like that.

1602
01:09:31,864 --> 01:09:33,254
Well, then you must have great soil.

1603
01:09:33,426 --> 01:09:33,794
Hmm?

1604
01:09:33,794 --> 01:09:35,241
I say, you must have rich soil.

1605
01:09:35,427 --> 01:09:35,973
Where?

1606
01:09:35,973 --> 01:09:36,977
On the farm?

1607
01:09:37,772 --> 01:09:38,961
Rich soil?

1608
01:09:39,837 --> 01:09:40,299
Why?

1609
01:09:40,393 --> 01:09:42,436
Well, if you raise all those products,

1610
01:09:42,722 --> 01:09:43,797
Yea.
- yes.

1611
01:09:43,867 --> 01:09:44,745
Yes, what?

1612
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:45,678
I don't know.

1613
01:09:45,678 --> 01:09:47,039
<i>hahaha
</i> You don't know...

1614
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:48,572
You must have rich soil, haven't you?

1615
01:09:48,773 --> 01:09:50,175
Yea... rich soil?

1616
01:09:50,175 --> 01:09:50,686
Yes.

1617
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:52,373
On the farm?
-On the farm.

1618
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:54,470
No!

1619
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:55,983
Yes!

1620
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,975
You mean, you mean it's FER'EL? [fertile]

1621
01:09:57,975 --> 01:09:59,682
<i>Hahaha
</i>Yes!
- Yea, yea

1622
01:09:59,781 --> 01:10:02,411
Oh, yea, mighty, mighty fer'el.

1623
01:10:03,816 --> 01:10:05,122
I don't think it's funny.<i>
Hahaha</i>

1624
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:08,982
Are you a farmer?

1625
01:10:08,982 --> 01:10:11,068
No, Char-- Eh, No, Mortimer.

1626
01:10:11,068 --> 01:10:12,479
Just call me Dugan, that's alright.

1627
01:10:14,468 --> 01:10:17,313
<i>Hahaha
You know. You see, um...</i>

1628
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:20,495
I, uh. I'm not a farmer, but I'm a student of Palmer Street.

1629
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,462
Are you really?

1630
01:10:21,462 --> 01:10:22,317
Yes. Yes.

1631
01:10:22,953 --> 01:10:26,200
You know I can look into your hand here and I can read your past and your future.

1632
01:10:26,517 --> 01:10:28,081
Is that so?

1633
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:29,931
What will they think of next?

1634
01:10:30,279 --> 01:10:31,733
You have a very interesting hand.

1635
01:10:31,733 --> 01:10:33,212
Yea, yea, yea.

1636
01:10:33,282 --> 01:10:35,815
You notice that your fingers are all the same shape.

1637
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:37,189
Yea, five of a kind.

1638
01:10:37,189 --> 01:10:38,531
Yea that's right.

1639
01:10:38,593 --> 01:10:41,956
And now your index finger you'll notice the nail on your index finger...

1640
01:10:41,956 --> 01:10:42,852
is very broad.

1641
01:10:42,885 --> 01:10:44,333
-Yea 
 -There's a lesson there.

1642
01:10:44,333 --> 01:10:46,089
Yep what is it?

1643
01:10:46,150 --> 01:10:46,642
Yes...

1644
01:10:46,824 --> 01:10:48,449
I'll never stick it in the wringer again.

1645
01:10:50,009 --> 01:10:51,762
Now this is your heart line.

1646
01:10:51,951 --> 01:10:54,998
ehhh... that's the love line.

1647
01:10:55,075 --> 01:10:57,061
You were in love last summer weren't you?

1648
01:10:59,603 --> 01:11:01,968
Oh my my my.

1649
01:11:02,089 --> 01:11:03,793
-You mean Tilly? 
 -Yes.

1650
01:11:04,219 --> 01:11:05,579
Where you in love with Tilly?

1651
01:11:05,666 --> 01:11:08,514
Uh well we fooled around.

1652
01:11:09,584 --> 01:11:10,633
Just the once.

1653
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:17,329
-Well now I'm very happy to tell you Mortimer. 
 -Yea?

1654
01:11:17,329 --> 01:11:19,369
That you're going to inherit two thousand dollars.

1655
01:11:19,465 --> 01:11:20,972
Oh boy, oh boy.

1656
01:11:21,226 --> 01:11:23,185
But through legal procedings you're going to lose it.

1657
01:11:23,185 --> 01:11:24,775
Oh bo... Oh yea?

1658
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,703
I went through that in a hurry didn't I?

1659
01:11:28,136 --> 01:11:29,057
Are you making much money?

1660
01:11:29,057 --> 01:11:31,813
Well I make two dollars a hole selling fertile dirt.

1661
01:11:31,827 --> 01:11:32,572
You do?

1662
01:11:32,654 --> 01:11:34,078
I used to only get a dollar a load.

1663
01:11:34,078 --> 01:11:35,421
-A dollar a load. 
 -Yea.

1664
01:11:35,489 --> 01:11:37,231
Why you're making good money now...

1665
01:11:37,231 --> 01:11:38,937
-two dollars a load for fertile dirt. 
 -Yep.

1666
01:11:39,236 --> 01:11:40,428
Great man Roosevelt.

1667
01:11:40,428 --> 01:11:41,433
Yes.

1668
01:11:43,849 --> 01:11:45,803
You have increased your product a hundred percent.

1669
01:11:45,864 --> 01:11:48,226
Yep, and it's the same old stuff.

1670
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,002
Well wasn't that funny Charlie?

1671
01:12:00,205 --> 01:12:02,033
Oh come on now wasn't that funny?

1672
01:12:02,033 --> 01:12:03,713
Don't talk to me. Don't touch me.

1673
01:12:03,906 --> 01:12:05,417
<i>Don't touch me!
- All right!</i>

1674
01:12:05,665 --> 01:12:06,902
Did you enjoy Mortimer?

1675
01:12:07,241 --> 01:12:07,819
Mortimer?

1676
01:12:07,915 --> 01:12:10,612
That's the most humiliating thing you've ever done to me, Bergen!

1677
01:12:10,612 --> 01:12:11,545
Well, what do you mean?

1678
01:12:11,545 --> 01:12:12,358
Yeah...

1679
01:12:12,539 --> 01:12:13,954
Either he goes or I go!

1680
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:14,739
Oh, I see.

1681
01:12:14,909 --> 01:12:17,114
There ain't room for three of us, Bergen. That's all!

1682
01:12:17,189 --> 01:12:17,765
That's all!

1683
01:12:18,029 --> 01:12:19,045
That's all!
- No lis--

1684
01:12:19,045 --> 01:12:20,714
D-DON'T touch me.
- All right.

1685
01:12:20,937 --> 01:12:22,425
Now--
- L-let go of the lapel!!

1686
01:12:22,425 --> 01:12:23,436
All right.

1687
01:12:23,615 --> 01:12:26,736
I'll clip you, so help me! I'll <i>mow</i> you down!

1688
01:12:26,736 --> 01:12:28,562
Oh, you will?
- Yeeah!

1689
01:12:28,799 --> 01:12:29,955
Aw, you're not mad at me.

1690
01:12:29,955 --> 01:12:30,719
Yes, I am.

1691
01:12:30,755 --> 01:12:31,623
No, you're not.

1692
01:12:31,623 --> 01:12:32,717
<i>Yes</i>, I am.

1693
01:12:32,796 --> 01:12:33,789
No, you're not.

1694
01:12:33,894 --> 01:12:35,225
Oh, yes, I am.

1695
01:12:35,806 --> 01:12:37,760
That's a lovely suit you have on.

1696
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,664
Oh, you like it? I have a new tailor.

1697
01:12:39,664 --> 01:12:42,129
And I'm mad at you! No.
- Listen. Eh, Charlie.
 - No!

1698
01:12:42,273 --> 01:12:43,918
I want you to look at me.
- No, I don't want to look at you.

1699
01:12:44,039 --> 01:12:45,353
Charlie.
- No! I can't stand it.

1700
01:12:45,353 --> 01:12:46,543
Listen.
- Do do doo...

1701
01:12:46,543 --> 01:12:47,638
Look at me.

1702
01:12:47,845 --> 01:12:49,017
Huh?
- Look at me.

1703
01:12:49,090 --> 01:12:49,969
Are you sure you're mad at me?

1704
01:12:50,574 --> 01:12:51,728
Huh?
- Are you mad at me?

1705
01:12:51,917 --> 01:12:53,177
Well, I just said,

1706
01:12:53,261 --> 01:12:54,273
it was a dirty trick.

1707
01:12:54,273 --> 01:12:56,013
I think I know. But are you mad at me?

1708
01:12:56,198 --> 01:12:57,455
Well, I just said...

1709
01:12:59,286 --> 01:13:02,309
Well, I guess blood is thicker than water!
<i> Hahaha</i>

1710
01:13:06,586 --> 01:13:09,467
Come. Smile, my dear. That's better!

1711
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:13,287
You know. I'm doing all this just to make you happy.

1712
01:13:14,068 --> 01:13:16,394
I'd be terribly disappointed if I thought I'd failed.

1713
01:13:17,031 --> 01:13:18,172
You haven't.

1714
01:13:51,077 --> 01:13:52,357
Darling, I love you.

1715
01:13:53,076 --> 01:13:55,287
I came all this way hoping you'd ask me to marry you.

1716
01:13:56,055 --> 01:13:56,819
- I couldn't.

1717
01:13:57,337 --> 01:13:58,126
But why not?

1718
01:13:58,486 --> 01:13:59,895
There's nothing to prevent it now.

1719
01:13:59,895 --> 01:14:00,887
- How can you say that?

1720
01:14:01,341 --> 01:14:03,736
A blind man who has to be led around by the hand.

1721
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:06,368
I want to hold you by the hand forever.

1722
01:14:06,683 --> 01:14:07,788
-It's impossible.

1723
01:14:08,083 --> 01:14:10,764
Where ever we'd go there'd be glances. Whispers.

1724
01:14:11,303 --> 01:14:13,345
I wouldn't mind for myself. But for you...

1725
01:14:13,813 --> 01:14:15,680
<i>- I couldn't have you pitied because of me.</i>

1726
01:14:16,270 --> 01:14:17,251
<i>- I love you too much.</i>

1727
01:14:17,498 --> 01:14:20,100
Then there's nothing else in the whole world I care about.

1728
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:21,583
-It's no use, Mary.

1729
01:14:22,118 --> 01:14:23,113
-You're in the world.

1730
01:14:23,968 --> 01:14:24,643
-I'm out of it.

1731
01:14:24,859 --> 01:14:25,738
Don't say that!

1732
01:14:27,169 --> 01:14:28,489
Good. Good. She's fine.

1733
01:14:28,795 --> 01:14:29,674
Nice quality.

1734
01:14:29,777 --> 01:14:30,343
Thank you.

1735
01:14:30,343 --> 01:14:31,520
- I knew you'd think so.

1736
01:14:32,314 --> 01:14:35,590
John, I can't tell you what a kick I got when I heard your voice.

1737
01:14:35,681 --> 01:14:37,473
I'd give anything to see you do it!

1738
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:40,045
Why, Lou, I haven't done a play in 12 years.

1739
01:14:40,045 --> 01:14:40,819
You know that.

1740
01:14:40,819 --> 01:14:42,298
I couldn't even remember the lines.

1741
01:14:42,298 --> 01:14:43,136
I'd risk it.

1742
01:14:43,497 --> 01:14:46,041
However, I suppose it's useless to argue.

1743
01:14:46,158 --> 01:14:47,885
Hollywood's got you.

1744
01:14:48,747 --> 01:14:52,384
Miss Martin, I regret to say that I'm not doing anything more this year

1745
01:14:52,384 --> 01:14:54,066
perhaps next season?

1746
01:14:54,408 --> 01:14:55,396
If you're still available.

1747
01:14:55,396 --> 01:14:57,188
Well, do I hear you saying you're not going to do this play??

1748
01:14:57,188 --> 01:14:59,335
Well, I've got to have a star in the man's part, John.

1749
01:14:59,335 --> 01:15:01,092
If you won't do it, I can't think of anyone else.

1750
01:15:01,421 --> 01:15:02,537
Couldn't you persuade him?

1751
01:15:02,996 --> 01:15:04,398
Oh, no. I couldn't.

1752
01:15:04,982 --> 01:15:05,882
Well... uheh...

1753
01:15:06,572 --> 01:15:08,443
Too bad for me and for you, too.

1754
01:15:08,898 --> 01:15:10,805
Well, good bye, Miss Martin. It was very nice.

1755
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:12,985
I'm sure you'll have no trouble on Broadway.

1756
01:15:13,088 --> 01:15:14,129
Thank you, very much.

1757
01:15:14,323 --> 01:15:16,013
John, why don't you stick around awhile?

1758
01:15:16,013 --> 01:15:19,406
You might recall some of your family's ancient glories.

1759
01:15:20,505 --> 01:15:23,753
Remember when your mother and father did Romeo and Juliet together

1760
01:15:23,753 --> 01:15:25,265
for 39 weeks?

1761
01:15:25,793 --> 01:15:27,966
Your brother did Othello for 40.

1762
01:15:28,834 --> 01:15:31,194
Seems a pity to think you're not going to carry on!

1763
01:15:31,194 --> 01:15:33,048
You dog!
<i> heheh</i>

1764
01:15:34,437 --> 01:15:36,209
Well, if you change your mind,

1765
01:15:36,545 --> 01:15:38,695
Oh, it's too bad. You know, eh...

1766
01:15:38,903 --> 01:15:41,451
You two would be very good together!

1767
01:15:42,188 --> 01:15:43,479
Bye.
 Good bye, Miss Martin.

1768
01:15:43,479 --> 01:15:44,374
Good bye.
- Good bye, Mr. Mallory.

1769
01:15:44,374 --> 01:15:45,123
<i>Bye, Joe!</i>

1770
01:15:49,497 --> 01:15:51,046
Would you like to do this play with me, Katherine?

1771
01:15:51,166 --> 01:15:52,288
Oh, I'd love to!

1772
01:15:53,386 --> 01:15:55,204
But you mustn't. Not if you think it's wrong.

1773
01:15:55,398 --> 01:15:56,021
Wrong?

1774
01:15:56,483 --> 01:15:57,551
How can it be wrong?

1775
01:15:57,812 --> 01:15:59,366
It's the least I can do for you.

1776
01:15:59,776 --> 01:16:01,279
If you're going on the stage at all..

1777
01:16:01,496 --> 01:16:02,593
It ought to be here.

1778
01:16:02,688 --> 01:16:03,450
and with me.

1779
01:16:05,302 --> 01:16:06,245
You see up there?

1780
01:16:07,843 --> 01:16:09,016
Second row in the balcony.

1781
01:16:09,411 --> 01:16:10,354
the end seat

1782
01:16:10,749 --> 01:16:13,017
That's where I sat when I was 10 years old.

1783
01:16:13,883 --> 01:16:15,490
I saw my mother for the last time.

1784
01:16:15,887 --> 01:16:17,340
That was a long time ago.

1785
01:16:17,717 --> 01:16:18,342
Too long.

1786
01:16:19,163 --> 01:16:22,202
Oh, but how would I remember that audience in their jewels and their urbans

1787
01:16:22,207 --> 01:16:23,474
standing there, cheering!

1788
01:16:24,034 --> 01:16:26,223
And they will again, soon, for you, my dear.

1789
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:29,418
And when you've taken curtain call after curtain call

1790
01:16:29,796 --> 01:16:31,172
and they still want more of you

1791
01:16:31,677 --> 01:16:32,542
I'll come out.

1792
01:16:32,667 --> 01:16:34,675
And put my arm around you before the footlights

1793
01:16:35,713 --> 01:16:36,874
and I'll tell them Katherine.

1794
01:16:37,572 --> 01:16:38,821
I'll tell them who you are.

1795
01:16:44,327 --> 01:16:49,077
John Mallory in "Return To Paradise"

1796
01:16:51,321 --> 01:16:53,123
I hear it's sold out for 4 weeks, Lou.

1797
01:16:53,741 --> 01:16:55,201
Pretty smart, bringing Mallory back.

1798
01:16:55,331 --> 01:16:57,034
I hope you'll say so in your reviews.

1799
01:16:57,228 --> 01:16:57,998
How's the girl?

1800
01:16:58,034 --> 01:16:58,973
Sensational!

1801
01:16:59,252 --> 01:17:01,198
I mean, as an actress. 
- Yes, that's what I mean.

1802
01:17:01,779 --> 01:17:03,827
I thought she was Mallory's discovery.

1803
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:39,381
Oh, Good evening, Miss Martin.

1804
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:40,851
My, but you look lovely!

1805
01:17:40,851 --> 01:17:43,291
Thank you, I'm so excited I can hardly talk.

1806
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:44,369
And who isn't?

1807
01:17:47,194 --> 01:17:47,817
Oh, Johnny,

1808
01:17:47,941 --> 01:17:49,121
You better call half hour.

1809
01:17:49,424 --> 01:17:50,777
<i> Half hour, please!</i>

1810
01:17:51,385 --> 01:17:53,696
High ball glasses. Cocktail glasses. Cards...

1811
01:17:53,696 --> 01:17:54,091
Yes, sir.

1812
01:17:54,298 --> 01:17:56,776
And uh... have the table 'bout four foot downstage.

1813
01:17:57,297 --> 01:17:58,811
Oh, hello, Katherine.
- Hello, Joe.

1814
01:17:58,836 --> 01:18:00,540
Take a look at that house. It's sold out.

1815
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:01,536
<i>Half hour, please.</i>

1816
01:18:01,784 --> 01:18:02,801
Where shall I put these?

1817
01:18:02,801 --> 01:18:03,582
Out in the hall.

1818
01:18:03,582 --> 01:18:04,668
Is that the cord he rehearsed with?

1819
01:18:04,668 --> 01:18:05,216
Yes.

1820
01:18:05,216 --> 01:18:06,196
<i>Andrews.
-</i> Yes, sir.

1821
01:18:06,196 --> 01:18:07,415
How's Mr. Mallory?

1822
01:18:07,431 --> 01:18:08,311
Is he here, yet?

1823
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,312
No, miss.
- What?

1824
01:18:09,671 --> 01:18:11,288
I've been here since 5:30.

1825
01:18:11,313 --> 01:18:14,079
You know how he dreads a New York opening. He's always the last one in.

1826
01:18:14,204 --> 01:18:16,897
Well, even so. Half hour's been called. You better go check on him.

1827
01:18:16,897 --> 01:18:17,555
Very good, sir.

1828
01:18:44,354 --> 01:18:45,224
Hey, you!

1829
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:47,227
Yes, you!

1830
01:18:47,958 --> 01:18:48,628
Come here.

1831
01:18:54,274 --> 01:18:56,318
I think we've had the pleasure of meeting before.

1832
01:18:56,641 --> 01:18:58,057
I wouldn't call it a pleasure.

1833
01:18:58,503 --> 01:18:59,595
You seeing the show?

1834
01:18:59,991 --> 01:19:01,241
Do you think I'm a sucker?

1835
01:19:01,638 --> 01:19:03,987
Still a blundering, hot-headed fool, aren't you?

1836
01:19:04,621 --> 01:19:07,367
For my part, I'd be very happy if I never had to see you again.

1837
01:19:07,663 --> 01:19:09,695
I think I'll be able to arrange that all right!

1838
01:19:10,021 --> 01:19:12,224
Oh, it isn't as easy as all that.

1839
01:19:13,124 --> 01:19:14,177
You're still in love with her.

1840
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:16,131
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

1841
01:19:16,553 --> 01:19:18,312
Go on in. Maybe you'll learn something.

1842
01:19:19,133 --> 01:19:19,797
From you?

1843
01:19:19,797 --> 01:19:21,918
Oh, don't argue. Do as I say.

1844
01:19:22,507 --> 01:19:24,115
When you hear my curtain speech,

1845
01:19:24,582 --> 01:19:26,274
come back and offer your apologies.

1846
01:19:30,847 --> 01:19:32,841
<i>On stage. Places please.</i>

1847
01:19:35,988 --> 01:19:37,895
<i>On stage. Places please.</i>

1848
01:19:38,269 --> 01:19:39,245
You're late, Mr. Mallory.

1849
01:19:39,245 --> 01:19:41,779
Nonsense. You've got loads of time

1850
01:19:41,779 --> 01:19:42,743
Loads of time.

1851
01:19:49,757 --> 01:19:50,768
My cane, Andrews.

1852
01:19:51,616 --> 01:19:52,352
My gloves.

1853
01:19:53,965 --> 01:19:55,004
My chapeau.

1854
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:58,653
Are you all right, sir?

1855
01:19:59,950 --> 01:20:01,254
Why, of course, I'm all right.

1856
01:20:01,772 --> 01:20:02,804
Can I get you some coffee, sir?

1857
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:04,415
No, I don't need any coffee.

1858
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:07,936
I only had a couple of highballs just to steady my nerves.

1859
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:10,502
Important night, Andrews!

1860
01:20:10,907 --> 01:20:12,445
The house is sold out.
- Yes, sir.

1861
01:20:13,525 --> 01:20:15,048
Miss Martin in her dressing room?

1862
01:20:15,048 --> 01:20:15,539
Yes, sir.

1863
01:20:18,644 --> 01:20:19,171
Andrews!

1864
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:20,785
What's my first line?

1865
01:20:21,104 --> 01:20:22,371
"I waited for you in the garden"!

1866
01:20:22,371 --> 01:20:25,518
Oh, yes. Of course. "I waited for you in the garden."

1867
01:20:25,885 --> 01:20:27,865
You know, Andrews. It's the strangest thing

1868
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:31,482
that I can never remember my first lines on opening night.

1869
01:20:32,539 --> 01:20:35,308
Until I get on the stage, and then it all comes back to me.

1870
01:20:37,776 --> 01:20:38,755
Mr. Mallory!

1871
01:20:38,755 --> 01:20:40,173
Awwww, Andrews.

1872
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:44,849
You haven't too much time, sir.

1873
01:20:45,248 --> 01:20:47,109
Andrews. Now, you treat me like a child.

1874
01:20:47,566 --> 01:20:50,140
The act runs 6 minutes before I make my entrance.

1875
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:53,937
And in 6 minutes I can make up for Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde.

1876
01:21:03,383 --> 01:21:04,940
I wonder if Barry is here.

1877
01:21:05,255 --> 01:21:06,370
He said he wasn't coming.

1878
01:21:06,525 --> 01:21:08,217
Oh, that was for Honey's benefit.

1879
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:09,785
He isn't fooling her, either.

1880
01:21:10,292 --> 01:21:12,024
May I have Charlie's autograph?

1881
01:21:14,353 --> 01:21:15,566
This is forgery, you know.

1882
01:21:16,145 --> 01:21:17,377
Charlie may sue me.

1883
01:21:17,419 --> 01:21:19,163
Thank you. Thank you, Mrs. Bergen.

1884
01:21:19,202 --> 01:21:20,502
Oh, I'm not Mrs. Bergen.

1885
01:21:20,753 --> 01:21:22,240
I'm Mrs. McCarthy!

1886
01:21:26,049 --> 01:21:29,161
The scene is the drawing room of Richard Storm's Long Island estate.

1887
01:21:29,585 --> 01:21:31,420
And evening in late Spring.

1888
01:21:48,971 --> 01:21:49,795
See who that is.

1889
01:21:51,556 --> 01:21:52,230
Yes?

1890
01:21:52,253 --> 01:21:53,150
Kay: <i>May I come in?</i>

1891
01:21:53,446 --> 01:21:56,136
<i>Not just now, Miss Martin. Mr. Mallory's dressing.</i>

1892
01:21:56,175 --> 01:21:58,097
I just wanted to thank him for the flowers.

1893
01:21:58,264 --> 01:22:00,088
And tell him I'm going to do my best.

1894
01:22:00,379 --> 01:22:02,224
Thanks, my dear! Good luck!

1895
01:22:02,687 --> 01:22:03,584
Same to you.

1896
01:22:12,705 --> 01:22:13,818
Bottle snatcher!

1897
01:22:14,897 --> 01:22:18,409
I feel it's too ghastly. I never even suspected anything until he bought her here.

1898
01:22:18,724 --> 01:22:21,067
Brought who here, Charlotte? The house is full of people.

1899
01:22:21,067 --> 01:22:22,249
<i>Mary Draper!</i>

1900
01:22:22,450 --> 01:22:23,344
Good luck. 
-

1901
01:22:23,383 --> 01:22:24,391
Thanks, Joe!

1902
01:22:24,991 --> 01:22:26,043
I need it.

1903
01:22:26,043 --> 01:22:27,629
You don't know what tonight means to me.

1904
01:22:28,062 --> 01:22:29,095
<i>...and I won't have it!...</i>

1905
01:22:29,151 --> 01:22:30,676
"And when they're cheering,

1906
01:22:30,914 --> 01:22:32,893
"I'll come out and put my arm around you.

1907
01:22:33,331 --> 01:22:34,974
"And I'll tell them who you are.

1908
01:22:35,853 --> 01:22:36,619
What did you say?

1909
01:22:36,659 --> 01:22:37,733
Nothing, Joe.

1910
01:22:37,926 --> 01:22:38,823
Wait and see.

1911
01:22:38,863 --> 01:22:41,162
<i>...I don't see why you need any help to wreck this one...</i>

1912
01:22:41,498 --> 01:22:43,268
Jenny.
- I'm going home.

1913
01:22:43,570 --> 01:22:46,480
The idea of you dragging me here away from my own guests,

1914
01:22:46,539 --> 01:22:48,258
simply because you two--
- Shh!

1915
01:23:00,895 --> 01:23:03,151
Miss Draper. Mrs. Stopherson, my aunt.

1916
01:23:03,207 --> 01:23:04,082
How do you do?

1917
01:23:04,318 --> 01:23:06,437
Richard has told me a great deal about you.

1918
01:23:06,837 --> 01:23:08,905
Charlotte has told me a great deal about <i>you</i>.

1919
01:23:09,411 --> 01:23:11,554
Forgive me for leaving you now. I have guests waiting.

1920
01:23:11,792 --> 01:23:14,403
I'd like to have a cup of tea with you, if you're still here tomorrow.

1921
01:23:14,403 --> 01:23:15,524
I should love that.

1922
01:23:16,202 --> 01:23:17,172
Good bye, Jenny.

1923
01:23:17,412 --> 01:23:18,164
Good bye, Charlotte.

1924
01:23:18,303 --> 01:23:19,310
Sorry, I can't help.

1925
01:23:19,529 --> 01:23:21,323
Au revoir, Miss Draper. 
- Good bye.

1926
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,353
Where is everybody?
-At supper.

1927
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,073
Richard, too? 
- Miss Draper, I'd like to have a talk with you.

1928
01:23:27,541 --> 01:23:28,505
<i>I'm going to be very frank.</i>

1929
01:23:28,706 --> 01:23:30,083
<i>- I wish you would.</i>

1930
01:23:30,312 --> 01:23:31,379
<i> Your staying here...</i>

1931
01:23:32,104 --> 01:23:33,448
<i>Mr. Mallory. On stage.</i>

1932
01:23:33,448 --> 01:23:34,483
Just a moment!

1933
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:41,522
I can't do it, Andrews.

1934
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:42,723
I can't do it.

1935
01:23:43,716 --> 01:23:46,496
10 years of those wretched pictures have done something to me.

1936
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:49,189
It isn't like carrying a play in New York.

1937
01:23:49,645 --> 01:23:52,804
But they're ready to tear anybody apart who has the temerity to come back from Hollywood.

1938
01:23:52,804 --> 01:23:54,898
But you were excellent in Cleveland, sir.

1939
01:23:57,170 --> 01:23:58,966
Mr. Mallory, please hurry.

1940
01:23:59,716 --> 01:24:01,102
Give me that first line again, Andrews.

1941
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:03,141
"I waited for you in the garden"! 
- Yes. I've got it.

1942
01:24:03,678 --> 01:24:05,273
"I waited for you in the garden."

What's next, Andrews?

"Where it's quiet and we can be alone"

1947

...<i>it's important that his family look after his interests...</i>

...<i>when he chooses to ignore them...</i>

1950

<i>I'm sorry you don't like me, Miss Dor.</i>

1951
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:23,442
<i>...because I'm leaving here tonight and never coming back.</i>

1952
01:24:23,783 --> 01:24:25,140
<i>...and Richard is coming with me.</i>

1953
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:26,239
Good luck, Mr. Mallory.

1954
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:27,053
Thanks, Joe.

<i>...You're not suited to each other...</i>

<i>That may be. But he loves me</i>

1959

1961
01:24:39,384 --> 01:24:40,801
<i>Don't be too sure of that!</i>

1962
01:24:59,210 --> 01:25:00,977
These fools. They're confusing me.

1963
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,143
I waited for you in the garden.

1964
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:09,762
I hated to leave because I wanted to see your face in the moonlight.

1965
01:25:10,019 --> 01:25:13,337
Richard, can't we go away from here where it's quiet and we can be alone?

1966
01:25:13,823 --> 01:25:15,000
We can be alone here.

1967
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:15,989
Please, Richard.

1968
01:25:16,297 --> 01:25:17,706
I'm not comfortable here.

1969

[Kay whispers] 
<i>"But, Mary, this is my home".</i>

1971
01:25:28,124 --> 01:25:29,037
Mary.

1972
01:25:29,671 --> 01:25:30,845
This is my home!

1973
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:33,017
I want you to love it as I do.

1974
01:25:33,629 --> 01:25:34,892
Soon it will be all yours.

1975
01:25:35,299 --> 01:25:37,290
We've a lot to talk over before that.

1976
01:25:37,526 --> 01:25:38,822
Please, Richard. Let's go.

1977
01:25:39,611 --> 01:25:41,055
Whatever you say, my dear.

1978
01:25:41,213 --> 01:25:43,077
I'll get my things and meet you in the car.

1979
01:25:47,195 --> 01:25:48,354
What's the matter with him, Andrews?

1980
01:25:48,855 --> 01:25:50,431
It's just nerves, Miss. That's all.

1981
01:25:50,843 --> 01:25:52,224
You were very nice, Miss.

1982
01:25:52,682 --> 01:25:53,781
Thank you, Andrews.

1983

<i>Have they?</i>

1986
01:26:00,191 --> 01:26:00,848
What's happening?

1987

...<i>Did you ring, sir?</i>

...<i>Oh, uh, yes...</i>

1989
01:26:03,701 --> 01:26:06,124
Bring me my hat and coat, please, and have my car waiting.

1990
01:26:06,126 --> 01:26:06,839
Yes, sir.

1991
01:26:09,091 --> 01:26:10,932
You're not going out anywhere this evening are you?

1992
01:26:11,269 --> 01:26:12,154
Ah, yes.

1993
01:26:12,893 --> 01:26:14,515
Yes, I'm going into town.

1994
01:26:14,798 --> 01:26:16,216
Have you forgotten your guests?

1995
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,160
Guests?

1996
01:26:24,237 --> 01:26:26,095
Crowd: What's the matter with Mallory?
- He's drunk.

[Off-stage whisper]

Can't you go in the morning?

1999
01:26:34,006 --> 01:26:35,093
Mallory: <i> What's my next line?</i>

2000

<i>"Charlotte, can't I even go into town?"</i>

2001
01:26:39,580 --> 01:26:40,271
Charlotte!

2002
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,980
Can't I even go into town without consulting you?

2003

<i>"Will you stop interfering in my life."</i>

2004

Go out there. He's coded.

2005
01:26:52,302 --> 01:26:53,168
Your coat, sir.

2006
01:26:53,459 --> 01:26:54,688
Will you put it on?
- Oh, thank you...

2007

You can't go on like this.

2011
01:27:06,490 --> 01:27:08,025
I've stood it as long as I intend to.

2012
01:27:08,096 --> 01:27:09,755
This girl's presence in this place

2013

is, is...
<i>[audience titters]</i>

2014

<i>...Richard, can I help you?</i>

2018
01:27:36,452 --> 01:27:38,928
You never seem to enjoy yourself as much, Charlotte,

2019
01:27:39,488 --> 01:27:41,292
as when you're making me--
<i>- You're going the wrong way.</i>

Bring down the curtain. Bring it down.

2023
01:28:26,584 --> 01:28:27,542
What's happened?

2024
01:28:27,716 --> 01:28:28,757
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

<i>Your money will be refunded at the box-office.</i>

2029
01:29:09,045 --> 01:29:09,645
Well.

2030
01:29:11,970 --> 01:29:13,350
Why don't you say it, Katherine?

2031
01:29:15,307 --> 01:29:16,858
Why don't you say that I failed you?

2032
01:29:19,228 --> 01:29:21,110
Why don't you say that I'm a drunken has-been?

2033
01:29:49,423 --> 01:29:52,714
I'd stay here for a little while, sir, if I were you. I wouldn't try to go out.

2034
01:30:05,613 --> 01:30:06,602
Was that Mallory?

2035
01:30:06,655 --> 01:30:07,857
I didn't see his face.

2036
01:30:08,227 --> 01:30:09,399
It looked like him.

2037
01:30:30,090 --> 01:30:31,126
Well.

2038
01:30:31,701 --> 01:30:33,671
You're the first to congratulate me.

2039
01:30:34,303 --> 01:30:36,258
What did you think of my night of triumph?

2040
01:30:39,839 --> 01:30:41,345
Stop it. Stop it!

2041
01:30:57,069 --> 01:30:58,069
Just a minute!

2042

<i>I can't imagine what happened.</i>

2043
01:31:06,850 --> 01:31:08,293
<i>Guess he drank himself out of it...</i>

2044
01:31:08,293 --> 01:31:09,544
<i>I liked what I saw of the girl.</i>

2045
01:31:11,193 --> 01:31:12,157
<i>He's smashed, is all.</i>

2046
01:31:12,157 --> 01:31:14,013
<i>It would have been funny, if it weren't so tragic.</i>

2047
01:31:22,794 --> 01:31:24,478
HURRY!

2048
01:31:24,746 --> 01:31:27,556
Yes. Certainly, it was Mallory. I saw him myself.

2049
01:31:27,904 --> 01:31:30,191
He was hit by a taxi. I tell you and badly injured.

2050
01:31:30,191 --> 01:31:31,146
Was Kay Martin with him?

2051
01:31:31,434 --> 01:31:33,443
Well stick there. Call me if anything happens.

2052

Hey, Suzy.

2053
01:31:39,789 --> 01:31:41,738
Find out where Kay Martin lives. Get her on the phone.

2054
01:31:42,143 --> 01:31:43,214
How should I know?

2055
01:31:53,579 --> 01:31:55,412
Where shall I put this stuff from the dressing room?

2056
01:31:55,412 --> 01:31:57,512
Oh, anywhere Edgar. Just leave it there.

2057
01:31:59,456 --> 01:32:00,329
Shall I answer?

2058
01:32:00,510 --> 01:32:01,545
Please.

2059
01:32:02,004 --> 01:32:02,824
Hello.

2060
01:32:04,335 --> 01:32:05,216
Reporters.

2061
01:32:06,492 --> 01:32:09,700
Miss Martin has nothing to say. She won't talk to any reporters.

2062
01:32:13,461 --> 01:32:14,606
It's nearly 11, Edgar.

2063
01:32:14,606 --> 01:32:16,088
I know. I've got to beat it.

2064
01:32:16,088 --> 01:32:17,440
I'm on the air in a half hour.

2065
01:32:17,862 --> 01:32:18,996
Good luck, Edgar.

2066
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:20,778
Thanks a lot for everything.

2067
01:32:21,096 --> 01:32:22,789
Kay, if I could only tell you how sorry--

2068
01:32:22,793 --> 01:32:25,137
All right, Lancelot. You've said your piece. Get going.

2069
01:32:25,426 --> 01:32:27,364
You know what Charlie will do if you're late.
- What?

2070
01:32:27,419 --> 01:32:30,113
He'll clip you Bergen. He'll <i>mow</i> you down!

2071
01:32:34,537 --> 01:32:37,268
We'll do what we can. It's... useless to operate.

2072
01:32:37,993 --> 01:32:40,523
Opiates to relieve his pain is about all we can do at the present.

2073
01:32:40,847 --> 01:32:42,319
Have you notified his family?

2074
01:32:42,817 --> 01:32:44,328
Mr. Mallory has no family, sir.

2075
01:32:45,208 --> 01:32:46,825
He's calling for someone named Katherine.

2076
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:49,035
Oh, yes. Do you think he might see her, sir?

2077
01:32:49,652 --> 01:32:53,134
Well, there's no reason why Mr. Mallory shouldn't do anything he wants to now.

2078
01:32:53,134 --> 01:32:54,134
Thank you, sir.

2079
01:32:54,531 --> 01:32:58,619
<i>Oh, Doctor! You know the...</i>

2080
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:04,151
Listen, operator. I told you. Miss Martin isn't talking to anybody.

2081
01:33:04,379 --> 01:33:07,036
No, not anybody. She has no statement to make!

2082
01:33:09,951 --> 01:33:12,249
Oh, let them say anything they like.

2083
01:33:12,536 --> 01:33:16,509
Everything that's nasty and mean has already been printed in all those gossip columns.

2084
01:33:17,296 --> 01:33:18,595
What harm can they do now?

2085
01:33:18,595 --> 01:33:20,249
Oh, you mustn't feel like that, Kay.

2086
01:33:21,337 --> 01:33:22,952
Oh, it's time for Edgar. Do you mind?

2087
01:33:22,952 --> 01:33:23,768
Of course, not.

2088
01:33:24,093 --> 01:33:27,041
He'd never forgive us if we didn't listen and tell him how bad he is.

01:33:42,689 --> 01:33:44,037
Mr. Bergen,

2092
01:33:44,037 --> 01:33:46,601
before we continue with another broadcast,

2093
01:33:46,773 --> 01:33:48,919
I want you to answer me one question.

2094
01:33:49,276 --> 01:33:51,270
Do I get an increase in my allowance?

2095
01:33:51,914 --> 01:33:55,578
After all, 75 cents a week isn't enough.

2096
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:57,040
What's that?

2097
01:33:57,478 --> 01:33:58,083
Uh...

2098
01:33:59,106 --> 01:34:01,397
I'm afraid we're not going to be very funny tonight.

2099
01:34:01,563 --> 01:34:02,377
Mr. Bergen?

2100
01:34:02,912 --> 01:34:04,197
I'm afraid not, Charlie.

2101
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:06,059
Ladies and gentlemen,

2102
01:34:06,366 --> 01:34:08,762
will you forgive us for not being at our best this evening?

2103
01:34:08,844 --> 01:34:11,174
Because a dear friend of ours, a great actor,

2104
01:34:11,486 --> 01:34:12,810
met with a disaster.

2105
01:34:13,359 --> 01:34:14,813
He opened in a new play tonight.

2106
01:34:14,813 --> 01:34:17,378
His first appearance on Broadway in 12 years.

2107
01:34:17,812 --> 01:34:20,004
Because he was nervous, he went up in his lines.

2108
01:34:20,365 --> 01:34:22,724
For the first time in a long and brilliant career,

2109
01:34:22,998 --> 01:34:25,466
the curtain had to be run down on John Mallory.

2110
01:34:26,288 --> 01:34:28,373
Must've been a terrible blow to his pride.

2111
01:34:28,884 --> 01:34:30,862
If only we could tell him that it didn't matter.

2112
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:33,160
But every man is entitled to one muff.

2113
01:34:33,609 --> 01:34:34,394
But we can't.

2114
01:34:35,027 --> 01:34:37,260
Because 20 minutes after the curtain came down,

2115
01:34:37,659 --> 01:34:39,634
John Mallory was struck by a taxi

2116
01:34:39,897 --> 01:34:41,480
and is now lying close to death.

2117
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:42,751
Cora!

2118
01:34:42,927 --> 01:34:45,133
If any of his friends are listening in, they ought to go to him.

2119
01:34:45,412 --> 01:34:46,885
He's at the mid-town hospital.

2120
01:34:47,287 --> 01:34:49,674
Mid-town hospital? Where is that?
- Get your coat on. I'll take you.

2121
01:34:59,111 --> 01:35:01,739
Andrews! He's going to be all right, isn't he?

2122
01:35:02,043 --> 01:35:03,552
The reports are exaggerated.

2123
01:35:04,306 --> 01:35:05,532
I'm afraid not, Miss.

2124
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:07,359
He wants to see you.

2125
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:09,827
It will make him very happy to know you're here.

2126
01:35:13,678 --> 01:35:15,171
I'll wait for you here.

2127
01:35:33,607 --> 01:35:34,407
Mr. Mallory,

2128
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:36,934
Andrews...

2129
01:35:38,776 --> 01:35:40,058
call the reporters...

2130
01:35:41,596 --> 01:35:42,645
something I...

2131
01:35:43,572 --> 01:35:44,562
want to tell them...

2132
01:35:45,993 --> 01:35:47,451
I should have done it long ago.

2133
01:35:47,822 --> 01:35:50,213
Mr. Mallory, you were asking for Miss Martin.

2134
01:35:50,718 --> 01:35:51,748
Yes, Andrews.

2135
01:35:53,004 --> 01:35:53,911
Be sure...

2136
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:56,338
be sure to tell her...

2137
01:35:57,214 --> 01:35:58,463
if you see her...

2138
01:35:59,847 --> 01:36:01,235
how much I love her...

2139
01:36:02,954 --> 01:36:04,817
Darling, I'm here.

2140
01:36:04,990 --> 01:36:05,445
Huh?

2141
01:36:11,303 --> 01:36:12,821
It's Katherine.

2142
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:15,351
Oh, my darling.

2143
01:36:17,986 --> 01:36:20,308
To think I could be so selfish and cruel!

2144
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:21,571
Cruel?

2145
01:36:23,115 --> 01:36:23,782
You?

2146
01:36:25,186 --> 01:36:26,103
Darling,

2147
01:36:27,089 --> 01:36:28,803
you've made me happier..

2148
01:36:29,785 --> 01:36:32,046
than all the people I've ever known...

2149
01:36:32,995 --> 01:36:34,811
put together...

2150
01:36:37,397 --> 01:36:38,941
You mustn't cry, dear.

2151
01:36:40,414 --> 01:36:41,543
Mustn't cry.

2152
01:36:45,150 --> 01:36:47,081
<i>I didn't keep my promise, Katherine.</i>

2153
01:36:48,281 --> 01:36:49,977
<i>I didn't tell them about you.</i>

2154
01:36:50,469 --> 01:36:51,644
It doesn't matter.

2155
01:36:53,058 --> 01:36:54,188
But I'm going to.

2156
01:36:55,439 --> 01:36:56,480
Andrews.
- Yes?

2157
01:36:57,302 --> 01:36:58,278
Reporters...

2158
01:36:59,193 --> 01:37:01,169
They're downstairs. Do you want them to come up now?

2159
01:37:01,169 --> 01:37:02,128
Yes! Yes.

2160
01:37:03,222 --> 01:37:04,239
Bring them in. 
- Very good.

2161
01:37:05,106 --> 01:37:06,034
Hurry.

2162
01:37:08,385 --> 01:37:10,364
You must be quiet now. Rest.

2163
01:37:11,095 --> 01:37:11,819
Darling,

2164
01:37:13,232 --> 01:37:14,424
try to forgive me...

2165
01:37:15,229 --> 01:37:17,258
for being such a bad father.

2166
01:37:17,432 --> 01:37:19,139
Oh, darling, you haven't!

2167
01:37:20,206 --> 01:37:21,817
<i>I've never done anything for you...</i>

2168
01:37:22,695 --> 01:37:24,029
<i>as a father should...</i>

2169
01:37:25,684 --> 01:37:27,748
<i>I'm going to tell the world about you.</i>

2170
01:37:30,389 --> 01:37:31,604
Well, at least...

2171
01:37:32,674 --> 01:37:33,791
I can do that.

2172
01:37:36,394 --> 01:37:37,171
Doctor!

2173
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:55,439
Miss Ryan.

2174
01:37:56,029 --> 01:37:57,835
<i>Hoooh, no!</i>

2175
01:38:02,087 --> 01:38:03,795
Just one moment, please.

2176
01:38:11,195 --> 01:38:14,235
Gentleman, Mr. Mallory has just passed away.

2177
01:38:39,629 --> 01:38:41,228
This goes to Pennsylvania station.

2178
01:38:48,355 --> 01:38:50,510
Katherine, I'm really sorry you're going away.

2179
01:38:50,697 --> 01:38:53,633
Why don't you stay here and do another play for me? Right away.

2180
01:38:54,827 --> 01:38:55,713
I can't.

2181
01:38:56,910 --> 01:38:57,980
Not while I'm...

2182
01:38:57,980 --> 01:39:00,849
I'm... on Roman Holiday for all the gossip columnists.

2183
01:39:01,623 --> 01:39:03,984
I'd feel I were capitalizing on his death.

2184
01:39:04,231 --> 01:39:06,169
But he would have wanted you to go on.

2185
01:39:06,874 --> 01:39:09,565
Well, maybe next year when they've forgotten all about me.

2186
01:39:09,565 --> 01:39:11,061
I'll come back and try again.

2187
01:39:11,449 --> 01:39:12,146
Well,

2188
01:39:12,925 --> 01:39:15,219
whenever you do decide, let me know.

2189
01:39:15,234 --> 01:39:15,900
Thanks.

2190
01:39:16,102 --> 01:39:17,328
You've been very kind.

2191
01:39:17,328 --> 01:39:18,864
If you wanna make that plane, you'd better hurry.

2192
01:39:19,068 --> 01:39:20,235
All set, Kay?

2193
01:39:21,087 --> 01:39:23,204
I think I have everything.
- Shall I take this?

2194
01:39:23,299 --> 01:39:24,364
Please, will you?

2195
01:39:28,219 --> 01:39:29,312
Mr. Bergen.
- Hello, Andrews.

2196
01:39:29,312 --> 01:39:30,491
[indistinguishable]

2197
01:39:30,605 --> 01:39:31,704
Excuse me, please.

2198
01:39:33,358 --> 01:39:34,876
Hello, Andrews.
- Miss Cora.

2199
01:39:35,801 --> 01:39:37,846
Miss Martin, I was so afraid I'd missed you.

2200
01:39:37,846 --> 01:39:39,763
You know I wouldn't go without seeing you.

2201
01:39:40,163 --> 01:39:41,972
I've been going through Mr. Mallory's effects.

2202
01:39:42,533 --> 01:39:45,688
I came across this letter of yours. I thought perhaps you'd like to keep it.

2203
01:39:48,404 --> 01:39:50,176
My letter of introduction.

2204
01:39:52,697 --> 01:39:53,782
Thank you, Andrews.

2205
01:39:54,181 --> 01:39:55,305
You- you won't...

2206
01:39:55,502 --> 01:39:57,265
Not if you don't want me to, Miss.

2207
01:39:57,665 --> 01:40:00,166
But don't you think it might be better for you, if--
 - No, Andrews.

2208
01:40:00,864 --> 01:40:03,633
No one would understand my waiting until now to announce it.

2209
01:40:04,042 --> 01:40:04,503
If..

2210
01:40:04,503 --> 01:40:06,564
If he had told, it would have been different, but...

2211
01:40:07,018 --> 01:40:10,796
If I were to tell now, it would only cause more unpleasant publicity about him and

2212
01:40:11,089 --> 01:40:12,147
I don't want that.

2213
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:14,089
I understand.

2214
01:40:18,001 --> 01:40:18,912
Allow me.

2215
01:40:18,912 --> 01:40:20,122
Thank you.

2216
01:40:27,375 --> 01:40:28,846
Oh, there's Barry.

2217
01:40:29,790 --> 01:40:30,725
Oh, Miss Martin!

2218
01:40:30,754 --> 01:40:31,986
Miss Martin, could we have a statement, please?

2219
01:40:31,986 --> 01:40:34,095
Please, gentlemen, I have nothing to say.
- Where're you going?

2220
01:40:35,189 --> 01:40:36,459
Hey.
- Barry!

2221
01:40:36,459 --> 01:40:38,709
Where, Miss Martin?

2222
01:40:38,736 --> 01:40:40,524
Beat to the shore, will you, Sparky?

2223
01:40:41,295 --> 01:40:42,756
Just a second. 
- Now, Come on!

2224
01:40:43,351 --> 01:40:45,450
Newspaper bloodhounds!

2225
01:40:46,221 --> 01:40:47,437
Are you going home?

2226
01:40:49,896 --> 01:40:50,741
Kay, darling...

2227
01:40:51,022 --> 01:40:51,779
Yes, Barry.

2228
01:40:52,001 --> 01:40:52,785
I love you.

2229
01:40:53,133 --> 01:40:54,989
I always have and I always will.

2230
01:40:55,458 --> 01:40:58,412
I was a fool. Jealous and suspicious.

2231
01:40:58,855 --> 01:40:59,974
I tried to forget you.

2232
01:41:00,165 --> 01:41:01,686
I never wrecked Honey's life.

2233
01:41:03,848 --> 01:41:07,424
It doesn't seem possible so many things could happen in so short a time.

2234
01:41:09,219 --> 01:41:10,747
And all because of this letter.

2235
01:41:12,222 --> 01:41:16,413
The letter that was to open the doors of fame, success and happiness.

2236
01:41:17,351 --> 01:41:18,199
And now...

2237
01:41:19,003 --> 01:41:20,126
Now, he's dead.

2238
01:41:20,593 --> 01:41:22,250
Did he mean so much to you?

2239
01:41:23,106 --> 01:41:24,919
More than anyone will ever know.

2240
01:41:28,601 --> 01:41:30,848
Then, I guess there's nothing else to say.

2241
01:41:33,427 --> 01:41:34,432
Barry, dear,

2242
01:41:35,453 --> 01:41:36,855
Will you please read this?

2243
01:41:41,372 --> 01:41:42,272
Please.

2244
01:41:51,128 --> 01:41:54,111
Edgar, tell them to hurry or we'll never get to the station in time.

2245
01:41:54,111 --> 01:41:57,526
Yeah, step on it.
- Oh, let's not bother. They'll never go there.

2246
01:41:57,538 --> 01:41:59,004
You're pretty sure, aren't you?

2247
01:41:59,004 --> 01:42:02,890
Listen, Cora. That boy and that girl clicked the first moment they looked at each other.

2248
01:42:02,890 --> 01:42:05,332
It's that kind of a look that will last until eternity.

2249
01:42:05,637 --> 01:42:06,992
My, my! How poetic.

2250
01:42:06,992 --> 01:42:08,567
Oh, shut-up.

2251
01:42:08,866 --> 01:42:11,144
Edgar, is Charlie always going to come between us?

2252
01:42:11,258 --> 01:42:12,547
Ye- How do you like that?

2253
01:42:12,566 --> 01:42:13,822
This is my car!

2254
01:42:13,822 --> 01:42:17,269
Bergen bought it for me, so I wouldn't have to be wrapped up in newspapers

2255
01:42:17,269 --> 01:42:18,309
every time I went out.

2256
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:20,859
Oh, I'm sorry, Charlie. But you are in the way.

2257
01:42:21,217 --> 01:42:23,671
Yes.
- Mr. Bergen and I have things to discuss.

2258
01:42:23,730 --> 01:42:24,878
Oh, sure, yeah...

2259
01:42:24,878 --> 01:42:27,198
I suppose you want to sit on his lap, huh?

2260
01:42:27,587 --> 01:42:29,635
Charlie.
- Huh?
- Would you be good enough, to...

2261
01:42:29,635 --> 01:42:30,780
No, I wouldn't!

2262
01:42:30,792 --> 01:42:31,788
Don't be a sap.

2263
01:42:32,002 --> 01:42:33,700
As long as I'm between you, you're safe!

2264
01:42:34,003 --> 01:42:37,654
Why if I leave, she'll take you like Grant took Richmond!

2265
01:42:38,112 --> 01:42:41,880
<i> Join hands. In chorus we will sing...</i>

2266
01:42:42,007 --> 01:42:45,096
<i>...through the hot time, do the whole town</i>

2267
01:42:45,096 --> 01:42:47,561
<i> tonight, my baby!</i>
