4
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,000
Hello Tom, hello Harry.

5
00:01:30,183 --> 00:01:31,100
Hello

6
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,162
Hello Jay.

7
00:01:32,162 --> 00:01:34,265
-Hello Dave, how are you? 
 -Good.

8
00:01:34,296 --> 00:01:34,869
Hello, Meyer.

9
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:36,078
-Hello, Tom. 
-How are things?

10
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:37,236
-Fine, fine. 
 -Good.

11
00:01:37,236 --> 00:01:38,441
The book is ready.

12
00:01:38,477 --> 00:01:40,394
- It's not. 
-I put it on your desk.

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh, come on now, let's have a look.

14
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:50,884
Ah, now that looks all right.

15
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:52,624
I say.

16
00:01:53,944 --> 00:01:54,863
Well,

17
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:56,711
lovely.

18
00:01:57,461 --> 00:01:58,992
Congratulations, Meyer.

19
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:00,000
Glad you

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,950
like it, Tom.

21
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,416
And you had

22
00:02:08,163 --> 00:02:09,907
I think this calls for a celebration.

23
00:02:09,942 --> 00:02:12,057
I-I brought some champagne in the car.

24
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,700
I got it for tonight, but if we drink it up, well my guests can drink beer.

25
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,483
Harry, get some glass.

26
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:20,000
And you take that, Meyer.

27
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,509
Tom's never been on time for an appointment in his life, he has

28
00:02:45,522 --> 00:02:48,478
absolutely no consideration for other people.

29
00:02:49,342 --> 00:02:51,439
You're not awfully fond of your son, are you, Mr. Collier?

30
00:02:51,564 --> 00:02:54,520
Cecelia, if you'd spent the time and money and effort I had,

31
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,688
to make that young man realize who he is and

32
00:02:56,688 --> 00:02:58,610
what he ought to be doing in the world,

33
00:02:59,576 --> 00:03:00,973
you haven't known Tom long.

34
00:03:01,296 --> 00:03:01,775
No.

35
00:03:02,008 --> 00:03:05,101
Owen, perhaps some longer experience might enlighten her.

36
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:07,698
Well, I presume what Mr. Collier means is that,

37
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:11,213
in ordinary terms, Tom doesn't seem to have gotten very far.

38
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:13,402
He's wasted his life in the cradle.

39
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:17,371
It must have been pathetic to see him wasting in a tree.

40
00:03:17,395 --> 00:03:20,278
I assure you his genius weren't shown even then.

41
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:23,412
I sent him to Harvard and he last two years there.

42
00:03:23,448 --> 00:03:26,115
I sent him to Oxford and he commutes from Paris.

43
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:28,156
I put him into the bank and he...tsk

44
00:03:28,156 --> 00:03:31,563
the whole world at the feet of that boy, the whole world

45
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:33,769
and all he's ever done is to run from it.

46
00:03:34,393 --> 00:03:37,489
Well, you know, Tom has his own ideas of what he wants to do with his life.

47
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:38,840
Yes, Wiggin?

48
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,804
A radio message came by phone from--

49
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,519
Oh, thanks. You can leave it here. I'll take care of it.

50
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,421
Right.

51
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:46,975
All right.

52
00:03:48,647 --> 00:03:49,826
Everything satisfactory?

53
00:03:49,873 --> 00:03:51,535
Uh, yes, quite thanks.

54
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:54,143
-Comfortable, miss? 
 -Quite, thank you.

55
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:55,767
Blanketry?

56
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:58,540
-Anyone? 
 -No, no, no, we were talking!

57
00:03:58,567 --> 00:04:01,787
-That's all right, go right ahead. Make yourselves at home. I'll be right along.

58
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,270
The butler?

59
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:07,370
He's charming.

60
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,260
He looks like a prize fighter.

61
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,044
He was.

62
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:13,688
There, there now. Tom will be here any second now.

63
00:04:14,135 --> 00:04:17,016
Mm, if what I think is true, I hope he never comes along.

64
00:04:17,752 --> 00:04:18,291
What?

65
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,234
Well, I'll tell you what's in my mind.

66
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:22,193
Heaven knows I don't want it there.

67
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:25,244
That girl he's been living with for the last three--

68
00:04:25,244 --> 00:04:26,630
Uh, just a minute, Sir.

69
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:28,079
It's all right.

70
00:04:28,088 --> 00:04:29,879
Good gracious, there's no secret in it.

71
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:32,008
Who is she anyway? What is she?

72
00:04:32,821 --> 00:04:34,434
She's an extremely nice girl.

73
00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:36,920
Hard working, talented.

74
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:39,238
She draws for one of the fashion magazines.

75
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:41,083
Very successful.

76
00:04:41,903 --> 00:04:45,098
She left three months ago for her magazine's Paris office for an indefinite stay.

77
00:04:45,098 --> 00:04:46,964
Oh, maybe she's coming back...

78
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,919
What of it, Mr. Collier?

79
00:04:49,075 --> 00:04:51,695
What of it? Everything of it! He's likely to marry her!

80
00:04:51,732 --> 00:04:54,267
Ha, I'm surprised he's missed it as long as he has!

81
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,600
Well, I've stood for his rowdy

82
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,500
friendships, I've put up for his idleness, his ill-mannered incidents--

83
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,600
-Sorry, Mr. Collier.

84
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:02,646
I'll have to ask you to let it go at that.

85
00:05:02,646 --> 00:05:03,798
Hmm? Why so?

86
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:05,578
Because it so happens that

87
00:05:05,601 --> 00:05:06,897
I am fine we're here.

88
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:07,908
How is that?

89
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:10,035
It's me Tom's going to marry.

90
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:12,425
And I've heard enough against him for quite a while.

91
00:05:13,236 --> 00:05:15,507
Ce, what are you talking about?

92
00:05:15,507 --> 00:05:16,464
Marrying.

93
00:05:16,878 --> 00:05:19,196
-I say I thought--
-On June 1st to be exact.

94
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:21,123
He asked you out here to tell you.

95
00:05:21,549 --> 00:05:23,391
And I imagined to receive your good wishes.

96
00:05:23,848 --> 00:05:25,470
My dear!

97
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:28,962
My dear, I congratulate Tom, and myself,

98
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,690
and I hope it will work out for you.

99
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:33,442
I hope he won't be out of the impossible as a husband,

100
00:05:33,468 --> 00:05:35,742
he has been at everything else I wanted him to do.

101
00:05:35,972 --> 00:05:36,890
I don't agree with you.

102
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,202
Tom's the most interesting, most

103
00:05:39,218 --> 00:05:40,910
attractive man I've ever known.

104
00:05:41,152 --> 00:05:42,995
I consider myself shot with luck.

105
00:05:42,995 --> 00:05:44,260
Oh, very loyal.

106
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:45,461
Not at all.

107
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,153
I simply believe in him.

108
00:05:47,707 --> 00:05:50,073
Now in his so called path, perhaps.

109
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:51,759
I'm not quite a fool.

110
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:53,541
But certainly, in what's to be!

111
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,775
Well, faith is a beautiful thing.

112
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:57,385
I think so.

113
00:05:59,152 --> 00:06:02,772
Well, if you can make a respectable citizen out of Tom Collier at this rate,

114
00:06:02,772 --> 00:06:05,304
you have nothing but praise from me, my dear.

115
00:06:06,337 --> 00:06:07,947
Seems not to occur to you,

116
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,818
when Tom has someone who really understands him,

117
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,517
to work and care for--
-Understands him?

118
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:14,780
Yes, completely.

119
00:06:15,393 --> 00:06:16,893
Why, he'll make what you call

120
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:18,714
a respectable citizen of himself.

121
00:06:18,714 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh, you think so?

122
00:06:20,243 --> 00:06:21,029
I know.

123
00:06:21,558 --> 00:06:25,136
And if what you laughingly refer to as my "faith" isn't very used to it...

124
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,969
Mm, love will conquer all.

125
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,920
Oh, yes, yes, of course, but forgive me a few doubts.

126
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,435
Oh, how is that so?

127
00:06:31,776 --> 00:06:33,349
"Darling, I'm coming back.

128
00:06:33,391 --> 00:06:36,846
Arrive on Paris at 8 tonight. Much love, Daisy."

129
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:39,008
Well,

130
00:06:39,297 --> 00:06:40,518
I know all about her.

131
00:06:40,722 --> 00:06:42,307
Did you know she was returning tonight?

132
00:06:42,546 --> 00:06:44,480
No, not at all.

133
00:06:44,648 --> 00:06:48,122
Owen, I'd like a few words with you, if Cecelia will pardon us.

134
00:06:48,147 --> 00:06:48,980
Certainly.

135
00:06:51,154 --> 00:06:52,256
Owen!

136
00:06:57,827 --> 00:06:59,876
I meant to tell you on the over,

137
00:07:00,638 --> 00:07:02,173
then I couldn't.

138
00:07:03,054 --> 00:07:04,283
Ce, how did it happen?

139
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,400
Very suddenly. Very sweetly. Yesterday.

140
00:07:11,428 --> 00:07:14,096
I am sorry. You asked.

141
00:07:15,676 --> 00:07:19,267
If you'll excuse me, I--I think I'll see what Mr. Collier wants.

142
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:44,112
-Hello, Harry! 
-Hiya, Tom.

143
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:45,524
Oh, uh, are they here yet?

144
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:46,479
-They are. 
-Good.

145
00:07:48,338 --> 00:07:49,210
Darling.

146
00:07:49,818 --> 00:07:50,823
Tom!

147
00:07:51,301 --> 00:07:52,562
Take my hat, will you?

148
00:07:53,025 --> 00:07:54,067
Thanks. Now get out.

149
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,516
Uh, I just wanted to tell you that...

150
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,000
later...

151
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,804
but there's a--

152
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,524
-guest! 
-a radio message come for you!

153
00:07:59,524 --> 00:08:00,900
Oh, get out.

154
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:02,893
Hello, darling.

155
00:08:02,922 --> 00:08:05,583
No, you're late! I'm furious with you!

156
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:06,310
Late?

157
00:08:08,482 --> 00:08:09,962
Yes, is that all right?

158
00:08:09,971 --> 00:08:12,820
It's terrible. I've taken off with a thrifty spinster.

159
00:08:12,841 --> 00:08:14,360
That's all you deserve.

160
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:15,883
Well, where are they? Father and Owen?

161
00:08:15,883 --> 00:08:16,747
In the other room.

162
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,043
Tell me darling, did you really say you'd marry me?

163
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:20,208
I'm afraid I did.

164
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,694
Oh, heaven help us both.

165
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,407
Just this one marriage, please.

166
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:25,482
You know, I haven't been very good about marriage.

167
00:08:25,513 --> 00:08:28,088
I was exposed to a very bad case of it as a baby.

168
00:08:28,128 --> 00:08:29,770
We must make a grand go of it.

169
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,500
Oh, we shall. Never you fear.

170
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,300
Well you just do everything I say, and it'll be all right.

171
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,036
With pleasure, Sir.

172
00:08:36,489 --> 00:08:39,122
Ce, darling, what a marveling object you are.

173
00:08:42,552 --> 00:08:43,824
Oh, I feel good.

174
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,645
-So do I! 
-Do you?

175
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,139
My lovely Ce!

176
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:49,922
Oh, stop it Tom, you're embarrassing me!

177
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:51,094
Why?

178
00:08:51,494 --> 00:08:52,801
I feel quite naked.

179
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:53,669
You look marvelous.

180
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:55,339
-You look--
-We'll have dinner in a couple of minutes, Tom.

181
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:57,359
Get glasses with ice, and run all the way!

182
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:58,939
Right. Did you get your radio message?

183
00:08:58,939 --> 00:08:59,624
What message?

184
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:17,949
Goodbye.

185
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:26,873
Don't tell me if you don't want to.

186
00:09:27,141 --> 00:09:28,056
But I do.

187
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:30,869
I'd always intended to at the first opportunity, anyway.

188
00:09:31,345 --> 00:09:33,137
And suddenly it seems, here it is.

189
00:09:36,338 --> 00:09:37,218
Well, Ce,

190
00:09:39,838 --> 00:09:41,122
for a long time, I've known...

191
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:42,659
known intimately...

192
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,294
a girl who's been very important to me...

193
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:47,318
Yes?

194
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,090
Daisy's done more for me than anyone in this world.

195
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:54,053
She's the best friend I've got, and I believe she always will be.

196
00:09:54,088 --> 00:09:55,484
I'd hate terribly to lose her.

197
00:09:57,406 --> 00:09:59,292
It's been a queer sort of arrangement.

198
00:09:59,945 --> 00:10:03,307
Well no arrangement at all, really. There's never been any idea of marriage between us.

199
00:10:03,946 --> 00:10:04,638
Well,

200
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:05,904
-Is she attractive, Tom?

201
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:06,910
To me, she is.

202
00:10:08,464 --> 00:10:10,256
I don't believe you'd like me half so well if

203
00:10:10,604 --> 00:10:12,851
Daisy hadn't knocked some good sense into me.

204
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:14,658
Someone's done a good job of it.

205
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:15,870
I'll tell her that.

206
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:19,407
I sent her a long cable this morning, all about us.

207
00:10:20,144 --> 00:10:21,951
Of course, she never got it, because this,

208
00:10:22,257 --> 00:10:23,871
this came from the boat.

209
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:25,810
She lands tonight.

210
00:10:26,004 --> 00:10:26,969
I see.

211
00:10:27,874 --> 00:10:34,549
Ce, we've--well, we've been everything possible to each other, of course, but...

212
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:38,903
-Yes, Tom. 
-At the time, as free as air. I mean, there's never been any feeling of...

213
00:10:39,286 --> 00:10:42,214
conventional responsibility towards each other's involvement.

214
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,577
I can understand that.

215
00:10:45,073 --> 00:10:46,171
Can you see?

216
00:10:46,785 --> 00:10:48,354
'Cause I never could.

217
00:10:49,785 --> 00:10:51,555
Anyhow, that's how it's been.

218
00:10:52,642 --> 00:10:54,984
We haven't been, what you call... in love

219
00:10:54,998 --> 00:10:56,458
for a long time now.

220
00:10:56,975 --> 00:10:58,192
Does she know that?

221
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,486
She knew it first.

222
00:11:02,908 --> 00:11:05,841
Well, I don't know what else there is to be said about it, except that

223
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:07,343
-that there's no need for you to be worried.

224
00:11:07,618 --> 00:11:08,752
You won't, will you?

225
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,579
Not if you tell me I needn't.

226
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:11,527
Well I do.

227
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:13,423
And finally,

228
00:11:13,765 --> 00:11:16,542
I think she ought to know the news about us pretty promptly.

229
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:19,453
Yes, probably.

230
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:23,516
Well, is anything I do about that all right with you?

231
00:11:24,341 --> 00:11:25,572
Of course.

232
00:11:25,572 --> 00:11:26,707
Thank you, Ce.

233
00:11:28,183 --> 00:11:29,629
Oh, hello father. How are you?

234
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,198
-Good evening, Tom.
 -Good evening.

235
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:33,870
You said five o'clock, and it's seven. I think--

236
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,200
-Oh did I? Is it?

237
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:38,083
Listen you and Owen, I want to tell you what this is all about.

238
00:11:38,102 --> 00:11:39,580
We know. We've heard.

239
00:11:39,978 --> 00:11:42,051
He was abusing you, so I had to tell him.

240
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:43,499
It didn't discourage you?

241
00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:44,456
On the contrary...

242
00:11:44,456 --> 00:11:45,731
Aww, sit down Tom.

243
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,353
Why, thanks very much Sir, but I think I am the one to be congratulated.

244
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:51,266
Yes, indeed we are.

245
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,931
I'm sure we shall be.

246
00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:56,109
Hello, Red, there you are. That's my boy.

247
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:57,652
Uh, that's my father over there.

248
00:11:57,696 --> 00:12:00,659
Oh, glad to meet you, Sir. 
-And my fiancée, Miss Henry.

249
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:02,387
Your...

250
00:12:07,024 --> 00:12:08,013
Good boy!

251
00:12:08,053 --> 00:12:09,255
Okay, thanks very much.

252
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,521
Well, here's how and why and wherefor.

253
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:13,664
And you know where marriages are made.

254
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,081
Is-is it all right?

255
00:12:21,098 --> 00:12:22,093
Swell.

256
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:24,330
Well, splendid, then. We're all satisfied, aren't we?

257
00:12:24,797 --> 00:12:26,223
Uh, yeah, just a moment Red,

258
00:12:26,254 --> 00:12:27,413
did you put the car away?

259
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,182
Say, how many hands have I got?

260
00:12:29,217 --> 00:12:31,098
Well don't. I shall need it.

261
00:12:32,849 --> 00:12:33,633
Father,

262
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,032
I fear I'll have to ask you to do the honours at dinner.

263
00:12:37,032 --> 00:12:38,520
But, why?

264
00:12:39,268 --> 00:12:41,257
I found I have to go straight back to town.

265
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,539
-Now you listen to me!

266
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:46,081
Seems to be extremely important that I should do it at once. In fact, I can't do otherwise.

267
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,735
You have the upfrontery, the colossal bad taste

268
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,603
on the night of celebrating your engagement to a fine, trusting, loyal girl,

269
00:12:52,603 --> 00:12:56,000
to go from her, your fiancé, to your--your--

270
00:12:56,267 --> 00:12:58,606
same old difficulty about words, ay father?

271
00:12:59,053 --> 00:13:00,763
Never mind, none of them apply to Daisy.

272
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,458
Well, I suppose you know better.

273
00:13:02,476 --> 00:13:04,247
-You leave here tonight…
-Yes, much!

274
00:13:05,271 --> 00:13:06,173
Much better!

275
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:09,624
Until tomorrow.

276
00:13:14,146 --> 00:13:15,757
My poor child.

277
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:17,516
I'm sorry, Cecelia.

278
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,526
Oh, I think it is exactly right.

279
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:23,328
Beautiful thing, faith.

280
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:25,816
A beautiful, beautiful thing.

281
00:13:40,936 --> 00:13:42,819
-Tommy! 
-Daisy.

282
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:45,939
I was looking for you at the dock.

283
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:47,997
I am so sorry. I didn't get your message in time.

284
00:13:48,013 --> 00:13:49,628
Well, come in.

285
00:13:52,486 --> 00:13:55,161
Oh, hello you dear Tom.

286
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:57,154
Hello Daisy.

287
00:13:58,595 --> 00:14:00,399
Now it seems as though I hadn't been away at all.

288
00:14:00,425 --> 00:14:01,673
Mmhmm.

289
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:04,988
Oh, come sit down. I have so much to tell you. It'll take hours.

290
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,534
Tom,

291
00:14:07,548 --> 00:14:11,002
two of the most exciting things have happened to me! Not one, two!

292
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:11,833
Really? What, really?

293
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,816
Oh I'm bursting with them!

294
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,752
-Darling...
 -Daisy, I--

295
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,323
No, no. You tell me. Come on.

296
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:22,631
Well, my heavy sledding ought to be over in a few weeks.

297
00:14:22,682 --> 00:14:24,155
The first of June, anyway.

298
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:26,490
What have you got on the fire, much?

299
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:28,202
Yes, a good year.

300
00:14:28,574 --> 00:14:31,753
-It is I--I--I… 
-We'll work day and night until the first of June, and then,

301
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,580
come to Mexico for a month with Daisy.

302
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:36,601
Oh, I'm dying to go because,

303
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:38,097
first of all,

304
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:40,928
-What? 
-I feel like such a fool.

305
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:43,351
Promise you won't speak word of it to anybody?

306
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,895
Tom, I think I can paint.

307
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,541
Haha, well that's no surprise. I've always thought you could paint...

308
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,779
Well then, you've always been wrong because it's just been within the past two months.

309
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:55,634
I believe that if I work my eyes out and my fingers to the bone,

310
00:14:55,634 --> 00:14:58,161
one day I may really paint.

311
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,948
But don't be hard on me now. No parties, no playing around; just work.

312
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:05,161
You mustn't let me show until you know I'm ready to, is that agreed?

313
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,004
All right.

314
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:09,378
You got a funny instinct about those things, and I'm counting on you.

315
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,120
That's the first thing.

316
00:15:12,056 --> 00:15:13,734
So, the second thing

317
00:15:14,212 --> 00:15:15,092
-What?

318
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:23,856
You know what? Suddenly, I feel shy with you.

319
00:15:26,574 --> 00:15:28,218
Oh I don't like it.

320
00:15:32,493 --> 00:15:34,030
I don't like it a bit.

321
00:15:36,382 --> 00:15:37,471
It's been a long time, Daisy.

322
00:15:38,724 --> 00:15:39,822
Too long.

323
00:15:44,107 --> 00:15:45,626
Gosh, I better wait to tell you the second thing.

324
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:46,926
No.

325
00:15:47,826 --> 00:15:48,646
Tell me now.

326
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,803
Oh my dear, what's wrong with us?

327
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,834
Come here to me.

328
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:03,109
That's better; I don't feel it as much now.

329
00:16:03,882 --> 00:16:07,037
You're a free man, you know, Tommy. With me, no questions asked.

330
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,200
So please, Mexico in June together, because listen!

331
00:16:11,842 --> 00:16:13,714
No, don't look at me. Look the other way.

332
00:16:15,328 --> 00:16:16,803
On the boat coming over,

333
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:19,695
the sweetest small boy, about two,

334
00:16:19,721 --> 00:16:22,184
and I got crazy about him, and I want one.

335
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,785
I want one badly.

336
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,352
So will you please be good enough to marry me?

337
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:30,375
Or you've always said you've wanted to, but I wouldn't let you,

338
00:16:31,219 --> 00:16:32,708
but you can be terribly serious.

339
00:16:33,314 --> 00:16:36,026
Not a life sentence you know. Just a little while if you like.

340
00:16:36,332 --> 00:16:38,685
Would be such a dirty trick on him if you didn't.

341
00:16:39,103 --> 00:16:41,217
Then after I get my stuff through for the July issue.

342
00:16:41,582 --> 00:16:43,487
Mexico for a month together.

343
00:16:44,552 --> 00:16:47,072
Oh I love you so much! I was a fool to ever think I didn't.

344
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:50,608
Now, come on, Tommy, be a good sport

345
00:16:51,012 --> 00:16:52,915
and give me a cigarette.

346
00:16:54,475 --> 00:16:55,992
Alright, never mind. Let's forget all about it.

347
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,891
That is a foul necktie you've got on--

348
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,472
What is it? Oh, you're going to tell me something terrible.

349
00:17:08,815 --> 00:17:09,385
What is it?

350
00:17:12,276 --> 00:17:14,243
I-I'm going to be marrying Daisy.

351
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:17,554
To be...

352
00:17:17,588 --> 00:17:20,937
Listen, listen, my darling!

353
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,300
It happened very quickly--

354
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,412
Yes it did. A month ago we hadn't even met.

355
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:27,246
-It was if... 
 -You can spare me the details. Please.

356
00:17:28,822 --> 00:17:30,220
I don't even want to know who she is.

357
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,111
Who is she?

358
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,452
Cecilia Henry her name is.

359
00:17:50,014 --> 00:17:52,013
Behold the bridegroom comer,

360
00:17:53,141 --> 00:17:55,112
and no oil for my lamp as usual.

361
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,218
A foolish virgin me.

362
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:02,800
Foolish anyway.

363
00:18:09,247 --> 00:18:11,112
When is it to be? Soon?

364
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,608
About the first of June, we planned.

365
00:18:15,036 --> 00:18:16,160
June? Oh well...

366
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,331
If well in that case, then Mexico would be out.

367
00:18:18,372 --> 00:18:20,077
But I never dreamed...

368
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:22,141
Ugh, I feel so awful.

369
00:18:22,864 --> 00:18:24,438
Remember me, Tom.

370
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,369
Daisy, there is to be no nonsense about not seeing each other again

371
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:29,961
as friends, or any of that, you know?

372
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,792
Oh, but there will be that nonsense.

373
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,209
Oh yes, it will be that all right.

374
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:36,491
I-I don't understand. I don't see why we shouldn't.

375
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:40,376
I thought for a long time, we'd been out of danger, so far as...

376
00:18:41,157 --> 00:18:42,535
well so far as...

377
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:44,228
Why didn't you let it go

378
00:18:44,275 --> 00:18:45,447
Well have we?

379
00:18:46,886 --> 00:18:48,023
See for yourself, Tom.

380
00:18:48,036 --> 00:18:50,078
You too dazy, you

381
00:18:51,155 --> 00:18:55,507
Well it's true. That side of it was never so much to as to not in comparison not,

382
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,134
well, not after those first crazy months.

383
00:19:00,296 --> 00:19:02,749
But, I-I thought that was natural.

384
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,148
I was even glad.

385
00:19:05,816 --> 00:19:08,643
Glad that it was all the needs that held us together.

386
00:19:09,354 --> 00:19:10,869
So closely.

387
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,258
Not a claim. Never a claim, but so closely.

388
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:22,565
Tom? Tom, do you have to marry her?

389
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:25,142
I want to marry her.

390
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,300
I thought that maybe you just wanted it--wanted it most awfully...

391
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,200
No, no, no. It's more than that. Much more than that.

392
00:19:30,221 --> 00:19:32,055
W-well, I don't see how you can quite

393
00:19:32,074 --> 00:19:35,758
tell that. For all that big talk, you know, we do still belong to the Animal Kingdom.

394
00:19:36,135 --> 00:19:37,948
-If you knew her, Daisy--
 -Yes, well I don't.

395
00:19:39,363 --> 00:19:40,328
Listen Daisy,

396
00:19:40,357 --> 00:19:42,753
there's no one like you. There never will be. I know that.

397
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,398
But this, it-it

398
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,431
I don't know. I can't tell you.

399
00:19:46,449 --> 00:19:48,528
Don't try. Don't try. Don't try.

400
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:53,933
Goodbye, you Tom Collier.

401
00:19:57,389 --> 00:19:58,464
Goodbye?

402
00:19:59,617 --> 00:20:00,716
Until when?

403
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:03,835
Doomsday, my darling.

404
00:20:06,852 --> 00:20:08,245
What are you talking about?

405
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:10,059
-Just that. 
 -Now, you listen to me.

406
00:20:10,205 --> 00:20:13,331
If you think I'm going to allow two people that mean as much to each other as you and I do,

407
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:15,777
To be separated by this forced ridiculous

408
00:20:15,777 --> 00:20:17,944
notion, that's your mistake, and just you try it.

409
00:20:18,105 --> 00:20:18,656
Tell me goodbye.

410
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:19,652
I'll do nothing of the kind.

411
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,000
Oh yes you will. You must.

412
00:20:21,162 --> 00:20:21,865
You have to!

413
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:24,824
Sharp, decent, and clean. No loose ends between us two.

414
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:27,186
But it's not decent! It's soft, it's sentimental, it's the kind

415
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:29,809
of thing you'd never have any use for--it taught me never to!

416
00:20:29,972 --> 00:20:30,994
-Goodbye.
 -I will not say it!
-Goodbye!

417
00:20:31,024 --> 00:20:32,635
-Goodbye
-No!
-You must!

418
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,600
Listen to me, Daisy, please!--

419
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,500
I have some things of yours that are here. I want you to take them along with you, please?

420
00:20:37,294 --> 00:20:39,964
I got me a new maid just before I landed. I let Harriet go when I left.

421
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,387
Well, the new maid had a swell hunch about us, she did.

422
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,100
Some shirts and things of yours that were here,

423
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,000
she wrapped up in a nice little bundle.

424
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,348
Well, she gets the gate for it--the big suite.

425
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:52,780
I don't believe in this! I don't believe in any of it!

426
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,002
Come on, get them, will you?

427
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,787
Fetch, Thomas!

428
00:20:56,126 --> 00:20:57,862
It's quite a neat, tidy little bundle.

429
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,108
If it stays around here, well...

430
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:04,075
I don't quite see myself crying into an old shirt, do you?

431
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,235
I work to do my son a great deal of it.

432
00:21:08,794 --> 00:21:10,876
No? Come on, fetch!

433
00:21:11,945 --> 00:21:13,867
Then, kindly permit me to.

434
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,095
And you will say "goodbye" to me.

435
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,849
You've said it so many times, so brightly.

436
00:21:29,596 --> 00:21:31,330
Say it this time, sadly.

437
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:32,867
You will, won't you?

438
00:21:34,397 --> 00:21:36,148
We'll make it an unmarried ceremony.

439
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:38,903
Keep everything quite regular.

440
00:21:40,286 --> 00:21:43,291
You must take my hand in yours, one splendid gesture.

441
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,024
Murmur, "Goodbye, my Daisy".

442
00:21:46,923 --> 00:21:48,441
Thanks very much

443
00:21:48,982 --> 00:21:50,935
for charming association

444
00:21:52,756 --> 00:21:54,794
and may we never, never meet again

445
00:21:54,829 --> 00:21:56,689
so long as we two shall live!

446
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:00,870
Here's the wash bag.

447
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,900
Now do as Daisy says, and

448
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,700
There you are.

449
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:50,796
Thank you.

450
00:22:54,135 --> 00:22:55,401
My dear, I congealed.

451
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:58,535
I can't say I envy you and your husband the trip into town.

452
00:22:59,303 --> 00:23:00,339
It is not my idea

453
00:23:00,361 --> 00:23:02,655
Well, why do you do it, Cee? It's so grim...

454
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:04,190
Tom wants to.

455
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:05,701
Such loyalty.

456
00:23:06,328 --> 00:23:07,803
It's her first showing,

457
00:23:07,821 --> 00:23:10,193
and he thinks for some reason that we should be there.

458
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:11,669
Who is she anyway?

459
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,300
An artist. Sage her name is.

460
00:23:16,097 --> 00:23:17,627
Tom says she's good.

461
00:23:18,386 --> 00:23:20,956
Oh well. I suppose puppies just have to hobnob

462
00:23:20,956 --> 00:23:22,799
with all sorts of queer people.

463
00:23:23,491 --> 00:23:26,305
We see few people of any description anymore.

464
00:23:26,341 --> 00:23:27,124
Yes.

465
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:29,537
Don't tell me about the hermit life you live.

466
00:23:29,962 --> 00:23:33,259
I think the least you could do would be to come to my Sunday breakfast every now and then.

467
00:23:33,781 --> 00:23:35,969
Tomorrow's will be such fun! Do see!

468
00:23:36,474 --> 00:23:38,333
-Perhaps we shall.
-Well, not if you're going tonight.

469
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:40,488
Perhaps, we shan't go in tonight.

470
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,482
Oh ho, so that's the way it is.

471
00:23:45,463 --> 00:23:46,555
Well, well, well,

472
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:48,207
Ahh, with us again!

473
00:23:48,502 --> 00:23:49,653
With you again, yes.

474
00:23:50,052 --> 00:23:52,500
Cee, don't you think we'd better be getting on the way, dear?

475
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:53,838
Oh, we've got hours.

476
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,600
I read the new book you published last week, Tom.

477
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:58,219
Oh yes? What do you think about it?

478
00:23:58,356 --> 00:24:00,779
Superblative, my dear i was simply ravished.

479
00:24:01,103 --> 00:24:02,866
Well, that's something, isn't it?

480
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,034
Isn't he beyond words?

481
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,984
You're the world's funniest man.

482
00:24:06,992 --> 00:24:08,332
You couldn't possibly be funnier.

483
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,600
Ahh, you don't know me.

484
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,700
Oh, yes I do.

485
00:24:11,127 --> 00:24:12,502
Don't you adore it, Cee?

486
00:24:12,547 --> 00:24:13,723
The book, I mean?

487
00:24:13,739 --> 00:24:15,127
I like it very much.

488
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:17,494
In fact, I'm afraid it was I who made Tom take it.

489
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,351
And I'm afraid that I still think it the worst

490
00:24:19,351 --> 00:24:20,700
Try to banned the prohibition.

491
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,800
But my dear!

492
00:24:21,862 --> 00:24:23,430
Everyone's simply devouring it!

493
00:24:23,455 --> 00:24:25,662
Well, there will be lot of sickness this winter.

494
00:24:25,945 --> 00:24:27,828
You're so foolish about it Tom.

495
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,400
You'll make enough on that one book to bring out ten he really cares for.

496
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,907
Yes, I suppose that's the way it works.

497
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,457
Oh, well, Father called today.

498
00:24:36,252 --> 00:24:37,250
What'd he want?

499
00:24:37,754 --> 00:24:40,493
He wants us to dine with him on Wednesday and spend the night.

500
00:24:40,528 --> 00:24:42,593
Oh, come on darling. Get us out of it, won't you?

501
00:24:42,912 --> 00:24:44,552
-Again?
-Mmm.
-How can I?

502
00:24:44,607 --> 00:24:46,517
I don't know. Tell him I'm up to eyes in work or anything

503
00:24:46,555 --> 00:24:47,586
else he won't believe.

504
00:24:47,817 --> 00:24:49,659
Tell him the old car is frozen stiff.

505
00:24:49,702 --> 00:24:52,044
Well I could easily send you in a closed car.

506
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:54,207
Gabby and I might even join you.

507
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:56,821
Oh, thank you. We-we cannot accept your sacrifice.

508
00:24:57,849 --> 00:25:00,040
Really, he's extraordinary. He defeats me.

509
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:04,603
Well, I guess I'll be barging along as they say.

510
00:25:04,987 --> 00:25:06,931
I, uh, I'm sure it's getting colder by the minute.

511
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:08,858
Yeah, it's almost cold enough to--

512
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,343
You know, I-I think we best bring the brass monkeys in tonight, don't you?

513
00:25:12,538 --> 00:25:13,784
The, uh, he he...

514
00:25:14,672 --> 00:25:15,705
Goodnight, Cee.

515
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,315
Goodnight, Grace.

516
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,346
Must you really?

517
00:25:19,383 --> 00:25:22,575
Well, uh, yes. I'm afraid I must.

518
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,300
Oh, now don't forget. You're coming to my Sunday breakfast tomorrow.

519
00:25:26,337 --> 00:25:28,243
We're having the most amusing people.

520
00:25:28,268 --> 00:25:30,810
Of course that's just what Sunday breakfast needs, isn't it Cee?

521
00:25:31,001 --> 00:25:33,143
I knew that the coffee must be very hot as well.

522
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,914
Goodnight.

523
00:25:41,761 --> 00:25:42,302
Goodnight.

524
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:45,900
I think that--

525
00:25:49,555 --> 00:25:51,085
Good evening.

526
00:25:56,218 --> 00:25:58,732
I think that desperate butler must embarrass you to death!

527
00:25:59,188 --> 00:26:00,047
Not much longer.

528
00:26:00,567 --> 00:26:03,535
Tom's promised to fire him tonight if he isn't completely insensible.

529
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,652
Good evening, Red.

530
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,720
G'evening

531
00:26:20,677 --> 00:26:22,574
Hey, yeah. You'd better get to bed, haven't you?

532
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:24,109
That's where I'm headed.

533
00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:25,163
Okay, just a moment, Red.

534
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:26,538
Now,

535
00:26:28,501 --> 00:26:31,004
Alright, bring a couple bottles of beer, will you?A

536
00:26:31,581 --> 00:26:32,017
Aye.

537
00:26:43,638 --> 00:26:44,899
What did you say to Regan?

538
00:26:45,352 --> 00:26:46,080
Regan?

539
00:26:46,985 --> 00:26:48,367
He never drinks on duty.

540
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:51,996
Why shouldn't he have the right to get slightly "mellow" on his one day out?

541
00:26:52,364 --> 00:26:53,489
Slightly mellow?

542
00:26:53,883 --> 00:26:55,060
He can hardly stand!

543
00:26:55,469 --> 00:26:57,750
When I said "good evening" to him, he didn't even answer!

544
00:26:58,389 --> 00:26:59,707
Well, maybe he couldn't speak.

545
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,400
All he did was to bow, like

546
00:27:01,432 --> 00:27:03,175
this, with a foolish grim. So

547
00:27:03,225 --> 00:27:04,658
low, he nearly fell over.

548
00:27:04,685 --> 00:27:08,375
Well, you know, it's--it's pretty hard to gage a bow under those conditions.

549
00:27:10,936 --> 00:27:11,715
Tom!

550
00:27:12,969 --> 00:27:14,795
I think it's selfish of us to keep him.

551
00:27:15,331 --> 00:27:16,271
Selfish?

552
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,002
Well, we're certainly depriving him of any chance he ever had

553
00:27:19,031 --> 00:27:20,500
to make anything of himself.

554
00:27:20,546 --> 00:27:22,915
Hang on, Cee. He broke his hand, so he'll never fight again.

555
00:27:23,306 --> 00:27:24,579
I don't mean fighting.

556
00:27:24,696 --> 00:27:27,707
Well, these are hard times. I don't know what else there is for him.

557
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:30,577
I'll leave it to you. Do as you like about him.

558
00:27:30,621 --> 00:27:32,120
And, you know, I feel somehow--

559
00:27:32,624 --> 00:27:35,203
I feel somehow that Red's good luck for me.

560
00:27:35,944 --> 00:27:38,766
I don't know. We understand each other. I'm awfully fond of him.

561
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:39,822
You must be.

562
00:27:39,871 --> 00:27:41,862
To ruin what other chance he might have in life.

563
00:27:42,473 --> 00:27:44,350
I wouldn't do that to Red. You know I wouldn't.

564
00:27:44,386 --> 00:27:45,470
You're doing it, though.

565
00:27:45,716 --> 00:27:48,370
What possibly could be more degrading to a man than housework?

566
00:27:49,353 --> 00:27:51,432
Well, I don't know. I wouldn't like to tell you, darling.

567
00:27:51,578 --> 00:27:53,947
Of course, you know you're making a regular Simon degree out of me.

568
00:27:53,988 --> 00:27:55,053
Cee, where's my whip?

569
00:27:55,053 --> 00:27:55,596
No.

570
00:27:55,778 --> 00:27:58,242
It's just that in your delightful, casual way,

571
00:27:58,419 --> 00:28:00,165
you've never thought of his side of it.

572
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:03,937
I wouldn't do that to Red. I really wouldn't.

573
00:28:04,965 --> 00:28:06,160
Ring for him, Cee.

574
00:28:06,616 --> 00:28:08,395
Me? I've nothing to do with it.

575
00:28:13,797 --> 00:28:15,519
Do you have to change? Or are you ready?

576
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:17,596
Seems to me that you were unnecessarily rude to Grace.

577
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:18,908
I have to change.

578
00:28:19,355 --> 00:28:21,172
Now we've got to go to her breakfast in the morning!

579
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:24,627
Honestly, Cee. All my life, I've been trying to get away from her kind of people.

580
00:28:24,902 --> 00:28:26,289
Takes all kinds to make a world.

581
00:28:26,729 --> 00:28:28,368
Yeah, then what have we got?

582
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:30,879
Come on, darling. You go get dressed.

583
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:36,228
I suppose you feel that we must go into town tonight.

584
00:28:36,829 --> 00:28:38,010
Of course. Why?

585
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,737
An exhibit lasts several days, doesn't it?

586
00:28:41,173 --> 00:28:43,759
Yes, but I want to be there tonight. Tonight's the opening.

587
00:28:44,203 --> 00:28:46,977
Besides, they'll all be there tonight.

588
00:28:48,952 --> 00:28:51,783
Have you, uh, seen any of your old friends lately?

589
00:28:52,957 --> 00:28:53,625
No.

590
00:28:54,194 --> 00:28:55,343
Why not, dear?

591
00:28:56,677 --> 00:28:58,246
Oh and the girl?

592
00:28:58,789 --> 00:29:02,249
Daisy, the one who's exhibiting tonight!

593
00:29:02,676 --> 00:29:03,892
Have you seen her?

594
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,500
No.

595
00:29:07,407 --> 00:29:08,367
Why not?

596
00:29:08,769 --> 00:29:11,068
I thought you felt her friendship was important to you?

597
00:29:12,172 --> 00:29:13,290
She won't see me.

598
00:29:14,356 --> 00:29:16,006
-Won't see you?
-No.

599
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,624
Come on, Cee. Be a good girl. You go on up and get dressed.

600
00:29:21,073 --> 00:29:22,368
Oh dear.

601
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,500
What's the matter?

602
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:24,326
Nothing.

603
00:29:25,275 --> 00:29:27,037
Dear, what is it?

604
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,863
It's just this blasted headache.

605
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:30,411
I had it all day.

606
00:29:30,443 --> 00:29:33,093
Oh, it's a shame. The cold air will fix that up.

607
00:29:33,132 --> 00:29:34,669
It was that that gave it to me.

608
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:38,615
Honestly Tom, I don't think I can face it.

609
00:29:39,183 --> 00:29:40,602
Why not send her a wire?

610
00:29:40,855 --> 00:29:42,613
"Best wishes"? That's enough, isn't it?

611
00:29:42,613 --> 00:29:43,814
-Isn't it?
-No, no, no. That wouldn't do.

612
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,300
I'm sure she'd be every bit as glad to have a telegraph.

613
00:29:46,308 --> 00:29:48,553
Cee, darling, listen, Daisy's been working for years for this.

614
00:29:48,847 --> 00:29:51,000
A telegram wouldn't do at all. I've simply got to be there.

615
00:29:51,385 --> 00:29:53,903
There's no particular reason why you should go. I could go alone

616
00:29:54,247 --> 00:29:56,977
I'll come-hmm

617
00:29:58,366 --> 00:30:00,013
Uhhh. Put them done there will you?

618
00:30:00,746 --> 00:30:01,568
Right.

619
00:30:04,108 --> 00:30:05,212
Tell him now.

620
00:30:05,256 --> 00:30:06,209
Alright.

621
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:08,542
And wait a minute. What's the rush?

622
00:30:09,715 --> 00:30:10,661
Stick around.

623
00:30:10,957 --> 00:30:11,831
Certainly.

624
00:30:13,322 --> 00:30:16,330
Listen Cee, if you feel tired, you go to bed.

625
00:30:16,787 --> 00:30:17,750
No, I'll come.

626
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:34,211
Well, drag a chair, Red.

627
00:30:41,657 --> 00:30:43,841
One more's about all I need.

628
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:48,281
Y'know the smaller of all the bedheads in the world

629
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:49,952
were put together in a row

630
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:52,917
my head would'a got up and sneered at the rest of em'

631
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:56,372
Well, here's how

632
00:30:56,883 --> 00:30:57,608
How!

633
00:31:00,287 --> 00:31:03,344
Ah that's the stuff. Haha that fills you up eh?

634
00:31:03,536 --> 00:31:04,774
Yo!
-Ah

635
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,230
Hey.

636
00:31:08,258 --> 00:31:10,012
Have you seen this one?

637
00:31:10,055 --> 00:31:11,764
I don't think so no.

638
00:31:12,197 --> 00:31:14,834
Tell me where to stop and remember the card.

639
00:31:19,033 --> 00:31:20,188
Right, got it?

640
00:31:20,188 --> 00:31:21,015
I got it.

641
00:31:30,238 --> 00:31:31,210
Where is it?

642
00:31:36,423 --> 00:31:37,358
Gone alright

643
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:38,869
Feel in your pocket

644
00:31:41,283 --> 00:31:42,119
Not this time

645
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:42,961
No?

646
00:31:42,961 --> 00:31:43,535
No.

647
00:31:44,834 --> 00:31:45,849
Is that it?

648
00:31:46,835 --> 00:31:47,514
Marvellous!

649
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,393
I paid 5 dolla's for that trick

650
00:31:53,617 --> 00:31:55,395
I'll let it go for $2.98

651
00:31:57,004 --> 00:31:58,532
Sorry, not interested

652
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,319
Red!

653
00:32:02,341 --> 00:32:03,859
Was it cold in town today?

654
00:32:04,511 --> 00:32:07,120
I don't envy those guys sellin' apples on the corners.

655
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:09,079
Oh, not much of a job then, eh?

656
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:10,567
Womens work!

657
00:32:13,478 --> 00:32:15,067
Pretty tough times, alright, eh?

658
00:32:15,562 --> 00:32:17,330
Say, look here Tom.
- What?

659
00:32:18,649 --> 00:32:22,197
If I...nothin'.

660
00:32:22,425 --> 00:32:24,217
If you're ever hard up, though, you know where to come

661
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,170
It goes both ways

662
00:32:28,578 --> 00:32:31,627
Red, I might just as well tell you right off.

663
00:32:31,665 --> 00:32:32,374
What?

664
00:32:34,473 --> 00:32:35,466
Nothing.

665
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:39,281
Say, how's your father these days?

666
00:32:40,531 --> 00:32:41,701
Never better, thank you.

667
00:32:45,425 --> 00:32:48,740
Red. Do you ever think about your future?

668
00:32:49,739 --> 00:32:51,778
I guess where I'm going will be plenty hot.

669
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:53,956
I mean...
- Oh you mean here?

670
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,547
Now that's a funny thing, because, listen Tom...

671
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,751
I...I'll let it go.

672
00:33:00,751 --> 00:33:01,574
No, but what?

673
00:33:02,257 --> 00:33:03,372
Fill er' up, will ya?

674
00:33:04,474 --> 00:33:06,997
Not much of a future in Buttling, eh Red?

675
00:33:07,525 --> 00:33:08,404
Oh, well...

676
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:11,012
No, I...I'm certainly grateful for all you've done

677
00:33:11,473 --> 00:33:13,014
Ah, be still will ya?

678
00:33:13,014 --> 00:33:13,519
I am.

679
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,625
That's fine, from you

680
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,130
I'll never forget when I was

681
00:33:20,156 --> 00:33:24,275
and you...well...I'll never forget it.

682
00:33:24,983 --> 00:33:26,182
Put it there, old boy.

683
00:33:26,817 --> 00:33:28,200
You're the top, boy.

684
00:33:29,521 --> 00:33:31,781
I don't know what you would think of me when I...

685
00:33:31,956 --> 00:33:32,718
When you what?

686
00:33:32,718 --> 00:33:33,445
When I...

687
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:37,589
Well, well what would you say for instance if I...

688
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:40,740
Nope, it's no good.

689
00:33:40,787 --> 00:33:42,788
Here, you're not in any trouble there are you?

690
00:33:43,135 --> 00:33:44,819
Trouble? Me? What trouble?

691
00:33:45,489 --> 00:33:46,488
Well then, look here Regan

692
00:33:46,885 --> 00:33:47,997
Well, Chief

693
00:33:50,991 --> 00:33:53,401
Don't call ya for president, the peoples choice!

694
00:33:53,443 --> 00:33:56,093
Now now Listen to me!
 - Wait, wait Tom. I just gotta tell ya...

695
00:33:56,286 --> 00:33:59,125
Don't hold it against me, but I'm...I'm quittin ya.

696
00:33:59,653 --> 00:34:00,954
I've took another job.

697
00:34:01,321 --> 00:34:03,303
What? 
 - Oh I know what you'll say...

698
00:34:03,494 --> 00:34:05,035
Holy Cadsmith...

699
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:07,646
I couldn't stand it any longer; she don't like my ways

700
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,670
I mean the missus. I get on her nerves.

701
00:34:10,074 --> 00:34:12,902
Last week, Mo Withers told me he wanted to open a country gym.

702
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,282
And would I run it with him

703
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:15,991
And you would

704
00:34:16,551 --> 00:34:18,254
But with a little bar attached.

705
00:34:19,254 --> 00:34:21,829
Heaven help me, I...I gave him my word.

706
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:23,631
I see.

707
00:34:24,476 --> 00:34:25,999
Well, what's in it for you, Red?

708
00:34:26,868 --> 00:34:28,759
Aw, Don't put it that way, Tom.

709
00:34:28,825 --> 00:34:30,003
I really want to know

710
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:33,302
$200 a month and a smell at the gate if anything

711
00:34:33,522 --> 00:34:34,955
Alright, sounds like good deal.

712
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,881
Let it go, I'll phone him

713
00:34:38,707 --> 00:34:39,576
When do you start?

714
00:34:40,444 --> 00:34:42,360
He wanted me last Wednesday.

715
00:34:43,338 --> 00:34:46,430
I've been trying all week to get up the nerve to tell you but

716
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:49,158
Well, but...
- How long will it take you to pack?

717
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:53,132
Well there's my hat trunk, and my shoe trunk...

718
00:34:53,566 --> 00:34:55,617
And a trunk for my fancy dress ball clothes...

719
00:34:55,664 --> 00:34:58,914
You leave by noon tomorrow, not a minute later! You understand?

720
00:35:00,606 --> 00:35:01,858
Ok, Chief.

721
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,769
I'm sorry you had to take it that way.

722
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,100
Don't be a fool, I'm overjoyed for you.

723
00:35:07,237 --> 00:35:09,685
Fact?
- Absolutely! Here's to the new job.

724
00:35:10,324 --> 00:35:11,752
Take it from me, boy, you're the goods!

725
00:35:12,191 --> 00:35:13,323
You're the goods.

726
00:35:13,922 --> 00:35:16,090
Well, you've got your points too, you know.

727
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:19,691
Anyhow,

728
00:35:21,624 --> 00:35:22,558
Anyhow!

729
00:35:26,539 --> 00:35:30,469
Well, you'll explain to the missus?

730
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:31,433
Yes, of course.

731
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,653
Tell her I'm sorry

732
00:35:34,368 --> 00:35:36,347
hope no inconvenience

733
00:35:36,347 --> 00:35:38,179
I...I'll explain really

734
00:35:39,682 --> 00:35:40,782
So long, Tom.

735
00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:42,170
Goodbye Red.

736
00:35:43,338 --> 00:35:44,714
So long, Tom.

737
00:35:45,984 --> 00:35:47,012
Goodbye Red.

738
00:35:47,443 --> 00:35:50,083
I'll...I'll give you a ring, how it goes.

739
00:35:50,132 --> 00:35:52,041
Yes, yes you do that.

740
00:35:52,429 --> 00:35:53,979
Keep your bib clean

741
00:35:54,702 --> 00:35:56,388
I will, old boy.

742
00:36:01,227 --> 00:36:02,333
Good luck, Tom.

743
00:36:28,084 --> 00:36:28,952
Tom,

744
00:36:29,736 --> 00:36:31,147
Oh hello

745
00:36:31,718 --> 00:36:32,539
Ready?

746
00:36:32,805 --> 00:36:33,713
Not quite.

747
00:36:34,077 --> 00:36:35,057
Did you tell him?

748
00:36:37,388 --> 00:36:39,278
You know I...I'll miss that guy

749
00:36:40,104 --> 00:36:41,293
I'll miss having him around.

750
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,182
Oh I know, darling.

751
00:36:44,198 --> 00:36:45,383
But it's for the best.

752
00:36:45,763 --> 00:36:46,809
I'm sure of it.

753
00:36:47,513 --> 00:36:50,461
I feel somehow...that my luck's going with him.

754
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,131
I'm your luck, darling.

755
00:36:59,181 --> 00:37:00,776
See if you're good

756
00:37:01,916 --> 00:37:03,035
Do I dear?

757
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:05,125
You haven't any clothes on.

758
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:08,250
Go along, now dress. Dress quickly, we've got to run.

759
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:10,083
Come and help me.

760
00:37:16,214 --> 00:37:18,361
No, you'd best not.

761
00:37:21,466 --> 00:37:22,262
Ce!

762
00:37:24,772 --> 00:37:26,634
Do you remember this nightgown?

763
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:29,228
I came across it in the bottom drawer.

764
00:37:29,765 --> 00:37:31,301
My spine simply loved it.

765
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,108
Quebec?

766
00:37:38,186 --> 00:37:38,721
Yes.

767
00:37:39,993 --> 00:37:41,356
Come here.

768
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:42,966
You'll make us late

769
00:37:43,054 --> 00:37:44,231
Well why don't we do that.

770
00:37:44,635 --> 00:37:46,085
We're late already, we'll miss it.

771
00:37:46,085 --> 00:37:46,840
Well,

772
00:37:47,604 --> 00:37:48,956
What if we do?

773
00:37:49,646 --> 00:37:51,389
Oh darling...

774
00:37:51,451 --> 00:37:52,757
You're the limit...

775
00:37:53,468 --> 00:37:55,524
10 minutes ago you said

776
00:37:57,624 --> 00:37:59,603
Tom.

777
00:38:00,135 --> 00:38:01,137
You go in alone.

778
00:38:01,186 --> 00:38:02,460
I decided to stay here

779
00:38:03,718 --> 00:38:04,476
You did what?

780
00:38:04,706 --> 00:38:05,889
Yes, it's too cold.

781
00:38:06,754 --> 00:38:08,898
I will tuck myself in my warm bed and read

782
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,885
Good night

783
00:38:13,384 --> 00:38:14,600
I'll miss you

784
00:38:22,407 --> 00:38:24,531
Look here, I'll stay!

785
00:38:25,411 --> 00:38:26,354
Good night.

786
00:38:27,531 --> 00:38:29,134
You'd better take your heavy coat

787
00:38:30,848 --> 00:38:31,986
Keep warm.

788
00:39:25,715 --> 00:39:26,912
Ah, Hello?

789
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,873
I want to send a telegram.

790
00:39:37,391 --> 00:39:40,211
I would have an exhibition, wouldn't I?

791
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,878
I'm to believe the critics ought to be painting sign boards.

792
00:39:43,135 --> 00:39:45,886
There are no judges of ones work but ones self these days

793
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:49,696
I wonder who that is?
- I'll answer.

794
00:39:56,224 --> 00:39:57,034
Hello Frank.

795
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,416
Hello Tom

796
00:39:59,715 --> 00:40:00,918
Is Daisy in?

797
00:40:00,918 --> 00:40:01,588
Yes

798
00:40:05,534 --> 00:40:06,318
Hello

799
00:40:06,641 --> 00:40:08,057
I think I'll run along Daisy

800
00:40:08,435 --> 00:40:09,536
No don't go Frank

801
00:40:09,928 --> 00:40:11,495
Yes I must go, goodbye Tom.

802
00:40:16,104 --> 00:40:20,084
Well, uh, speak to me somebody. Am I a leper?

803
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:23,358
What would you like me to say?

804
00:40:24,653 --> 00:40:29,650
Oh, uh. Take off your coat, Collie, and stay awhile.

805
00:40:30,396 --> 00:40:31,695
Thanks I think I will

806
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,865
Well it is, nice of you to ask me over.

807
00:40:40,245 --> 00:40:41,792
Yes but I didn't, you see.

808
00:40:42,368 --> 00:40:43,607
Well it was nice, anyway.

809
00:40:49,645 --> 00:40:51,662
Whatever made you think I wanted to see you?

810
00:40:52,903 --> 00:40:53,550
Nothing

811
00:40:53,964 --> 00:40:55,903
Except that I wanted to see you

812
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:01,061
How's eh..how's it coming?

813
00:41:02,154 --> 00:41:03,063
how's what coming?

814
00:41:03,063 --> 00:41:03,967
I mean the job

815
00:41:04,691 --> 00:41:05,474
Job?

816
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:07,829
Oh, the job. I gave that up last winter.

817
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:11,563
A trifle, can we say, Quixotic

818
00:41:11,884 --> 00:41:12,600
Shall we?

819
00:41:14,085 --> 00:41:15,313
How's Joe's book doing?

820
00:41:15,947 --> 00:41:16,950
Haven't you seen him?

821
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:17,959
No.

822
00:41:18,825 --> 00:41:21,087
Joe's book is doing fine, thank you.

823
00:41:22,217 --> 00:41:24,252
Course it can't compare with the magnificent value of

824
00:41:24,306 --> 00:41:26,012
being brought out by your vapid press.

825
00:41:26,471 --> 00:41:29,238
Indian summer

826
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:33,944
Oh what on earth made you take those things off?

827
00:41:34,231 --> 00:41:35,682
Oh, I don't know...money?

828
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,630
Ah but Daisy, I've reformed!

829
00:41:37,931 --> 00:41:39,819
You wait till you see the Bantom's new lists.

830
00:41:40,733 --> 00:41:41,776
I'm waiting.

831
00:41:49,329 --> 00:41:51,587
Well, I hear Frank's a hit?

832
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:52,542
She is.

833
00:41:54,281 --> 00:41:57,809
I uh, saw your exhibition today.

834
00:41:58,663 --> 00:42:00,408
Oh did you really? Funny, I missed you.

835
00:42:00,459 --> 00:42:01,577
What'd you think of it?

836
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:02,914
Well,

837
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,100
Oh tell me.

838
00:42:06,536 --> 00:42:08,753
Daisy, I don't think you're ready to show yet.

839
00:42:09,174 --> 00:42:10,192
How were the notices?

840
00:42:10,192 --> 00:42:11,082
Appauling.

841
00:42:11,514 --> 00:42:13,098
I suppose their reasons were all wrong?

842
00:42:13,098 --> 00:42:15,039
Yes, of course they were. What were yours?

843
00:42:16,588 --> 00:42:19,012
Well, you've been painting less than a year

844
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,700
yet you had about thirty canvasses to show.

845
00:42:21,982 --> 00:42:23,036
Thirty-two!

846
00:42:23,036 --> 00:42:24,185
An awful lot of paintings.

847
00:42:25,516 --> 00:42:26,704
Saying it like it is.

848
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,400
Oh yes. The one I loved,

849
00:42:28,826 --> 00:42:30,894
that one with the milk bottles on the doorstep, you know...

850
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:32,131
I'd like to buy that one.

851
00:42:32,503 --> 00:42:36,459
That's number 7. Sorry, not for sale.

852
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:39,514
But your drawings are marvelous.

853
00:42:39,514 --> 00:42:40,126
Only what, Sir?

854
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:43,042
Well it depends on what you want to be. I
thought it was a painter.

855
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:44,412
So did I.

856
00:42:45,557 --> 00:42:48,688
Doyer's drawings were always pretty good; he painted all the well too, I always thought.

857
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,100
The first year, I doubt it.

858
00:42:51,123 --> 00:42:52,649
I wasn't aware that it took a death to make the kind.

859
00:42:52,846 --> 00:42:54,401
And living in cities all your life...

860
00:42:54,401 --> 00:42:56,499
Oh I suppose I should

861
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,700
I don't think it would hurt a bit.

862
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,800
Well if you can show me a purer cobalt blue

863
00:42:59,804 --> 00:43:02,882
than of a winter sky over the east river in the afternoon at four o' clock,

864
00:43:02,882 --> 00:43:04,394
Now you're just being bull headed.

865
00:43:04,394 --> 00:43:05,831
Bull headed! Me?

866
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:08,711
Me? Bullheaded?

867
00:43:09,809 --> 00:43:10,779
Well, what more teacher?

868
00:43:10,779 --> 00:43:12,234
All I've said, and all I'm saying is that you

869
00:43:12,234 --> 00:43:14,157
can't expect the first crack out of the box

870
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,811
you've got to work this.

871
00:43:15,811 --> 00:43:16,600
Work?

872
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,456
Now he's telling me to work!

873
00:43:18,507 --> 00:43:20,081
Great Heavens what have I done else but?

874
00:43:20,118 --> 00:43:22,078
Much differently with such pains

875
00:43:23,031 --> 00:43:24,529
than turning out too much newnote

876
00:43:29,108 --> 00:43:29,854
Maybe.

877
00:43:40,086 --> 00:43:42,046
Maybe anything is too much.

878
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:46,108
Now, don't soften on Miss daytime.

879
00:43:46,154 --> 00:43:47,433
Well I do believe that's it.

880
00:43:47,433 --> 00:43:50,204
I think I've the old story: still hung over from the old job.

881
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,177
You should have pressure all the time.

882
00:43:52,558 --> 00:43:55,770
Still rushing countless sketches through against a magazine's deadline.

883
00:43:57,762 --> 00:43:59,454
Anyhow, I guess some deadline.

884
00:44:00,311 --> 00:44:01,237
Easy, darling.

885
00:44:02,185 --> 00:44:03,534
Oh, but you Tom.

886
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:06,876
Oh but you and strangers, honest of me ever.

887
00:44:08,634 --> 00:44:09,369
Daisy,

888
00:44:11,306 --> 00:44:12,531
do you miss me Daisy?

889
00:44:14,014 --> 00:44:18,697
You? Well, I'll tell you about that. See, it's this way...

890
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:24,314
Much?

891
00:44:27,796 --> 00:44:28,505
Constant.

892
00:44:30,094 --> 00:44:31,744
God...
- Oh, now you...

893
00:44:32,184 --> 00:44:34,057
No, nonsense this is ridiculous.

894
00:44:34,675 --> 00:44:35,934
We need each other, we do.

895
00:44:37,736 --> 00:44:39,611
Terribly, I'm convinced of it.

896
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,541
Never worse such friends, you and me.

897
00:44:42,477 --> 00:44:43,833
You see it's wicked to give that up.

898
00:44:44,274 --> 00:44:46,498
To lose anything so precious for no good reason.

899
00:44:47,292 --> 00:44:49,550
Why you of all people for shabby low down

900
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:50,805
question of convention?

901
00:44:51,306 --> 00:44:53,389
It'd only be considered by shabby, low down...

902
00:44:53,389 --> 00:44:54,715
Oh well now, wait a minute!

903
00:44:54,715 --> 00:44:56,197
A hundred times, I'd have give my eyes to see

904
00:44:56,492 --> 00:44:57,495
just to talk to you.

905
00:44:57,863 --> 00:44:58,911
Well here i am!

906
00:44:59,306 --> 00:45:00,391
Face it.

907
00:45:00,694 --> 00:45:02,208
May I come and see you just now then?

908
00:45:02,455 --> 00:45:05,117
If you like, just now and then.
- Oh, Sweet dear, thank you.

909
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:06,588
But no "sweet dear"

910
00:45:07,398 --> 00:45:09,229
That belongs to another life, years and years

911
00:45:09,551 --> 00:45:11,446
and years ago.

912
00:45:11,446 --> 00:45:12,033
I see.

913
00:45:12,246 --> 00:45:13,430
There are to be rules, are there?

914
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,785
One or two.

915
00:45:15,304 --> 00:45:16,705
Some very definite ones.

916
00:45:18,911 --> 00:45:20,598
Never secrets, never hidden.

917
00:45:20,783 --> 00:45:22,916
Why should a friendship be hidden? What's there to hide?

918
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:26,083
Well, it does get misunderstood.

919
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:28,517
It can't, it won't or the whole world grumbles.

920
00:45:29,157 --> 00:45:31,141
You did pretty right for a long time Tommy.

921
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:32,088
Tommy.

922
00:45:33,096 --> 00:45:35,067
Oh darling, how grand it is.

923
00:45:35,773 --> 00:45:36,866
Kiss the boy, Daisy.

924
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:38,738
No, you've got to go!

925
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:40,954
I won't really take long

926
00:45:45,774 --> 00:45:46,923
All as before.

927
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,500
Yes, except for one thing. 
 - What?

928
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,401
We're not in love anymore.

929
00:45:52,225 --> 00:45:53,063
Now run.

930
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,753
Hold it!

931
00:45:59,822 --> 00:46:01,224
How about lunch tomorrow?

932
00:46:01,478 --> 00:46:02,306
Lunch? 
- Yes.

933
00:46:02,569 --> 00:46:03,393
The old place.

934
00:46:03,441 --> 00:46:04,504
I'd love it.

935
00:46:04,716 --> 00:46:06,597
- Fine 
 -- And this guy John Donovan...

936
00:46:06,662 --> 00:46:08,324
Yes, he's opened a new place on 48th street.

937
00:46:08,577 --> 00:46:10,416
Alright. 
- Yes, now lets see, Wednesday is the next day...

938
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,400
I said I'd drive out and see Pat Atkins.

939
00:46:12,635 --> 00:46:13,676
Oh poor dear

940
00:46:13,676 --> 00:46:14,859
He's better now, come with me Daisy.

941
00:46:15,161 --> 00:46:17,868
Oh, Wednesday...
- Thursday, and if it's a fine day we'll take a picnic.

942
00:46:18,035 --> 00:46:21,609
Oh, you...
- Thursday, Thursday I'm at the press all day...

943
00:46:21,675 --> 00:46:22,917
but Friday...
- Oh now wait a minute,

944
00:46:22,963 --> 00:46:24,890
You said...
- How about 4 o' clock on Friday?

945
00:46:24,946 --> 00:46:26,395
Will you be here?

946
00:46:26,472 --> 00:46:27,931
Oh, I suppose so.

947
00:46:27,931 --> 00:46:29,077
Haha, good bye then darling.

948
00:46:29,457 --> 00:46:30,378
Till tomorrow?

949
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,310
Tomorrow. 
- What about this afternoon?
- What?

950
00:46:32,547 --> 00:46:32,917
Yes.

951
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,505
Yes, what about - how about a cocktail at Gene's place, 5 o' clock?

952
00:46:35,558 --> 00:46:38,210
Oh, the...Alright.

953
00:46:39,126 --> 00:46:40,233
Good bye, then.

954
00:46:43,416 --> 00:46:44,894
Sweet dear.

955
00:46:46,282 --> 00:46:47,205
5 o'clock.

956
00:46:50,553 --> 00:46:51,724
Ten minutes to 5.

957
00:47:05,317 --> 00:47:06,642
Frank!

958
00:47:10,347 --> 00:47:11,600
Frank!

959
00:47:13,004 --> 00:47:13,982
Frank!

960
00:47:14,987 --> 00:47:16,881
What is it, you frightened me?

961
00:47:17,059 --> 00:47:18,474
Frank I'm scared.

962
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:21,434
But Daisy, wait!

963
00:47:21,434 --> 00:47:24,021
Oh Frank, don't ask any questions: I need your help.

964
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,700
I know you've been holding your tongue Frank,

965
00:47:25,744 --> 00:47:27,716
But what is not my business...
- It's Tom.

966
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:29,856
I'm going away, a long way away.

967
00:47:30,919 --> 00:47:31,979
I love him, Frank.

968
00:47:32,041 --> 00:47:33,441
I love him more than I ever did.

969
00:47:33,598 --> 00:47:35,638
Think Daisy, wait, are you wise?

970
00:47:35,698 --> 00:47:36,501
I'm going alone.

971
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:37,870
Yes, that is wise.

972
00:47:37,937 --> 00:47:39,475
And nobody is to know where I've gone, either.

973
00:47:39,553 --> 00:47:41,138
No, of course not.

974
00:47:41,387 --> 00:47:42,400
No mess Frank, it's too

975
00:47:42,455 --> 00:47:43,697
avoid why I'm going.

976
00:47:43,784 --> 00:47:46,167
But it's your place to be calm
- Oh I can't!

977
00:47:46,304 --> 00:47:47,263
Does he love you?

978
00:47:47,654 --> 00:47:48,627
I don't know!

979
00:47:48,686 --> 00:47:50,608
I don't think he knows.

980
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,991
Oh Frank, he's so slim and

981
00:47:54,991 --> 00:47:56,552
Now snap out of it Daisy.

982
00:47:56,552 --> 00:47:59,400
He'll always be like that, I know he will, even when he's old.

983
00:48:00,458 --> 00:48:03,867
That funny way he stands, all stiff, with his feet turned out.

984
00:48:04,116 --> 00:48:05,846
What they call "Duck-footed", eh?

985
00:48:08,126 --> 00:48:09,239
No, certainly not.

986
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,118
Perfectly natural way to stand.

987
00:48:11,885 --> 00:48:14,070
It's a fine, strong way to stand!

988
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,300
Yes, but don't forget your water colours.

989
00:48:16,308 --> 00:48:18,111
Huh? oh.

990
00:48:18,171 --> 00:48:21,247
Frank. Maybe if I wait?

991
00:48:21,681 --> 00:48:23,464
Maybe I better see him once more and

992
00:48:23,528 --> 00:48:26,378
explain. 
- Daisy, if you want to go at all: you must go tonight.

993
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,811
Yes, I guess you're right.

994
00:48:30,061 --> 00:48:31,382
Come along, come along.

995
00:48:31,662 --> 00:48:33,076
Yes now...

996
00:48:39,063 --> 00:48:40,956
Look. 
- Yes?

997
00:48:41,474 --> 00:48:44,003
You know that painting of the doorstep, the one with the milk bottles, number 7?
- Yes?

998
00:48:44,124 --> 00:48:45,659
Well...

999
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:46,903
Will you wrap it up?

1000
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:49,322
And take it to him for me with my love?

1001
00:48:49,322 --> 00:48:50,500
Take it?

1002
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:53,002
Oh yes, yes you're having cocktails with him at Gene's in one hour.

1003
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,100
At 5 o' clock.

1004
00:48:58,616 --> 00:48:59,706
5 o' clock?

1005
00:49:00,301 --> 00:49:01,494
Ten minutes to 5.

1006
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:07,118
And Frank? 
- Yes darling?
 - When you see him...

1007
00:49:07,658 --> 00:49:08,914
kiss him for me!

1008
00:49:09,083 --> 00:49:09,558
What?

1009
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,700
Kiss him for me.

1010
00:49:14,888 --> 00:49:16,591
Kiss him for me...

1011
00:49:19,368 --> 00:49:21,037
Daisy...

1012
00:49:53,604 --> 00:49:56,547
Hello! How are ya?

1013
00:49:57,101 --> 00:49:58,644
Fine, thank you.

1014
00:49:59,805 --> 00:50:00,927
Glad to see you.

1015
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,730
Grab yourself a chair, I'll tell the missus you're here.

1016
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:05,900
You're too kind.

1017
00:50:06,224 --> 00:50:08,645
Ha, ain't seen ya since I've been back.

1018
00:50:08,645 --> 00:50:09,118
No.

1019
00:50:09,422 --> 00:50:10,882
You're back. Gee it's swell.

1020
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:12,053
I daresay.

1021
00:50:16,701 --> 00:50:17,957
Will you have some tea, father.

1022
00:50:17,957 --> 00:50:19,850
No, thank you my dear. No thank you.

1023
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:22,322
By the way, his

1024
00:50:22,388 --> 00:50:24,324
birthday is on the 23rd.

1025
00:50:24,967 --> 00:50:27,487
Think it would go well to have it a surprise party.

1026
00:50:27,955 --> 00:50:29,170
Have all his old friends

1027
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:31,479
give him a chance to realise he's outgrown them.

1028
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,900
And I hope you may be able to persuade him to move into town this winter.

1029
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,862
Must be uncomfortable to you out here?

1030
00:50:39,247 --> 00:50:41,423
Father, I'd so love being in town with you. But

1031
00:50:41,484 --> 00:50:43,159
you know how Tom feels.

1032
00:50:47,374 --> 00:50:48,883
I'm very contented here.

1033
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:51,736
Hmm. There's something besides contentment.

1034
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:00,400
How did that...that desperado Regan get back here?

1035
00:51:01,135 --> 00:51:02,967
Oh Tom ran into him somewhere.

1036
00:51:03,051 --> 00:51:04,893
Seems a new job didn't pan out. Regan

1037
00:51:04,949 --> 00:51:06,021
was ill,

1038
00:51:06,086 --> 00:51:08,082
so Tom asked we might bring him back.

1039
00:51:08,161 --> 00:51:09,132
I said he might.

1040
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,400
Oh, why not just give him something. Anything to get rid of him?

1041
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,200
Don't worry, father.

1042
00:51:13,939 --> 00:51:15,510
I'll work it out somehow.

1043
00:51:15,596 --> 00:51:17,726
I have the greatest confidence in you, my dear.

1044
00:51:18,244 --> 00:51:19,041
Thank you.

1045
00:51:19,583 --> 00:51:22,073
Well, I, I guess I must be getting back into town.

1046
00:51:24,254 --> 00:51:25,498
Good bye. 
- Good bye.

1047
00:51:27,566 --> 00:51:29,520
Operator? Long Distance.

1048
00:51:30,349 --> 00:51:33,232
I want to get the number of Miss Daisy Sage, in New York.

1049
00:51:35,201 --> 00:51:35,920
Yeah?

1050
00:51:36,848 --> 00:51:37,652
Just a minute.

1051
00:51:37,903 --> 00:51:39,283
Connecticut, calling you.

1052
00:51:45,651 --> 00:51:46,915
Oh this is miss Sage.

1053
00:51:47,092 --> 00:51:48,434
Oh yes, miss Sage.

1054
00:51:49,071 --> 00:51:50,826
Allow me to introduce myself.

1055
00:51:51,381 --> 00:51:53,108
I am Mrs. Thomas Colliard.

1056
00:51:53,189 --> 00:51:54,990
Mrs. Thomas Colliard?

1057
00:51:56,686 --> 00:51:58,594
I am so sorry we haven't met.

1058
00:51:58,938 --> 00:51:59,956
Oh, isn't it a shame.

1059
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:03,443
All of Tom's friends here abouts have so regretted not knowing you.

1060
00:52:05,403 --> 00:52:06,562
I called to tell you

1061
00:52:06,637 --> 00:52:10,111
his father and I are giving a surprise party for him here on the 23rd.

1062
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:13,584
You'll possibly remember it's his birthday?

1063
00:52:14,137 --> 00:52:15,373
Why no, I uh...

1064
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,000
We'd so love having you and Miss Schmidt

1065
00:52:18,123 --> 00:52:19,708
And Mr. Fisk, to the party.

1066
00:52:20,416 --> 00:52:21,759
And if possible, spend the night.

1067
00:52:21,822 --> 00:52:23,435
The 23rd...

1068
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:25,803
Oh no, now isn't that too bad.

1069
00:52:26,371 --> 00:52:27,794
Oh I'm terribly sorry, but

1070
00:52:27,794 --> 00:52:30,269
I just couldn't possibly make it on the 23rd.

1071
00:52:31,275 --> 00:52:33,334
Oh...I'm frightfully disapointed.

1072
00:52:33,949 --> 00:52:36,105
We must try again, sometime,

1073
00:52:36,457 --> 00:52:37,221
soon.

1074
00:52:37,982 --> 00:52:38,881
Yes.

1075
00:52:39,287 --> 00:52:40,005
Good bye.

1076
00:52:46,745 --> 00:52:47,816
Now what was that?

1077
00:52:48,182 --> 00:52:48,892
What?

1078
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:52,138
Mrs. Thomas, Thomas mind you, Colliard.

1079
00:52:53,531 --> 00:52:56,102
Wants to know if I won't surprise her - surprise Tom - on

1080
00:52:56,102 --> 00:52:58,390
his birthday and spend the night with him in the country.

1081
00:52:59,035 --> 00:53:00,717
Going to ask you and Frank too.

1082
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:01,703
And what did you say?

1083
00:53:01,703 --> 00:53:02,805
You heard me didn't you?

1084
00:53:03,742 --> 00:53:04,892
Look Daisy,

1085
00:53:05,377 --> 00:53:08,705
every since your trip to Nova Scotia, you've made Tom feel as though you don't want to see him.

1086
00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:10,650
And so he's cut himself off from

1087
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:12,082
well, from all of us.

1088
00:53:13,025 --> 00:53:15,119
He's only trying to do what he thinks you'll wish.

1089
00:53:15,183 --> 00:53:16,510
Well I don't propose

1090
00:53:17,718 --> 00:53:19,236
Mrs. Thomas Colliard,

1091
00:53:19,236 --> 00:53:21,506
invited me down there for some very good reason of her own.

1092
00:53:21,506 --> 00:53:23,090
Well don't take it out on Tom.

1093
00:53:23,395 --> 00:53:24,959
I think it'll do him a lot of good.

1094
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,400
He needs it. He needs us.

1095
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:28,460
Well if he's so weak...

1096
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,200
Oh, he isn't. Just bewildered.

1097
00:53:31,204 --> 00:53:32,543
If he could get back,

1098
00:53:32,616 --> 00:53:34,369
just now and then, with the right people

1099
00:53:34,463 --> 00:53:36,708
it might help him get a decent point of view again.

1100
00:53:38,068 --> 00:53:40,268
Oh, Joe, I love that boy.

1101
00:53:41,088 --> 00:53:43,343
With all my heart. 
- Then don't go.

1102
00:53:46,103 --> 00:53:49,966
I would like to find out something I think is true, is true.

1103
00:53:51,867 --> 00:53:53,846
I certainly would.

1104
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,314
May I look up the number for you miss Sage?

1105
00:54:03,029 --> 00:54:05,194
Oh thank you so much, Mr. Fisk. I think

1106
00:54:05,702 --> 00:54:08,833
by making a tremendous effort, I may be able to recall it.

1107
00:54:10,908 --> 00:54:12,732
Long distance please.

1108
00:54:17,033 --> 00:54:18,240
Brandy mam?

1109
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,435
How about some backgammon?

1110
00:54:25,435 --> 00:54:27,200
Oh fine, grand!

1111
00:54:30,097 --> 00:54:30,980
Hi Red.

1112
00:54:31,158 --> 00:54:32,655
No thank you.

1113
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:42,340
The boss has got you reading his new book?
- Uh huh.

1114
00:54:42,661 --> 00:54:44,285
Forget it, join the party.

1115
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:45,797
You might get some laughs.

1116
00:54:45,797 --> 00:54:47,172
Oh it's a nice party.

1117
00:54:47,345 --> 00:54:49,477
Not like we used to have though

1118
00:54:50,009 --> 00:54:51,887
I don't know hardly anybody here.

1119
00:54:52,582 --> 00:54:53,612
Don't you Red?

1120
00:54:54,635 --> 00:54:57,106
Aw, Red, why don't you get Tom to introduce you?

1121
00:55:03,181 --> 00:55:06,306
Of course I know very little about music but uhh...

1122
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:07,290
I know what I like.

1123
00:55:07,517 --> 00:55:08,792
That's for the boss.

1124
00:55:09,296 --> 00:55:10,448
Oh. Sorry.

1125
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:16,168
We're so anxious to hear you play, Miss Schmidt,

1126
00:55:16,262 --> 00:55:18,478
I am sure you're better than the radio.

1127
00:55:18,859 --> 00:55:20,242
But I didn't bring my cello.

1128
00:55:20,725 --> 00:55:21,492
Oh what a pity.

1129
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,071
Perhaps we could get one?

1130
00:55:23,448 --> 00:55:25,451
She's used to her own fiddle.

1131
00:55:27,459 --> 00:55:28,906
Yes, but is there any difference?

1132
00:55:29,345 --> 00:55:30,930
Yes, I suppose there is.

1133
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,900
Look what baby brought ya.

1134
00:55:38,515 --> 00:55:39,947
Well he is quaint.

1135
00:55:40,062 --> 00:55:40,820
Indeed.

1136
00:55:40,914 --> 00:55:42,469
He never spanks me.

1137
00:56:10,797 --> 00:56:11,927
McFinch!

1138
00:56:12,701 --> 00:56:14,240
But it's about fight time

1139
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,100
Cheerio.

1140
00:56:21,927 --> 00:56:23,524
Listen, you're a pretty good actor.

1141
00:56:24,182 --> 00:56:25,700
Try and act like a butler.

1142
00:56:26,086 --> 00:56:28,705
Right Sir. I knows me place Sir.

1143
00:56:29,213 --> 00:56:31,000
Don't lay it on, Meadows.

1144
00:56:31,491 --> 00:56:32,450
Oh No, Sir.

1145
00:56:33,496 --> 00:56:34,191
Say,

1146
00:56:34,356 --> 00:56:36,412
How's it feel to be 32 baby...uh...

1147
00:56:36,624 --> 00:56:38,058
Sir?

1148
00:56:38,153 --> 00:56:39,460
I...I'm bearing up.

1149
00:56:46,622 --> 00:56:48,463
Brandy Sir?

1150
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,485
No thanks.

1151
00:56:50,402 --> 00:56:53,203
Try it, I did. The results were very satisfactory.

1152
00:56:53,893 --> 00:56:55,406
No thank you.

1153
00:56:55,767 --> 00:56:56,537
Get out.

1154
00:56:57,485 --> 00:56:58,560
Get out.

1155
00:56:59,453 --> 00:57:00,835
Very good Sir.

1156
00:57:04,218 --> 00:57:06,509
Oh Joe.

1157
00:57:08,415 --> 00:57:10,323
This is awful tripe.

1158
00:57:10,323 --> 00:57:11,019
What?

1159
00:57:12,231 --> 00:57:16,493
This uhm, rotten egg about to be laid in the Bantam press.

1160
00:57:19,129 --> 00:57:20,306
Yeah I know.

1161
00:57:20,964 --> 00:57:22,302
But it'll make money.

1162
00:57:24,058 --> 00:57:25,757
Is that all he ever thinks about nowadays?

1163
00:57:25,835 --> 00:57:26,921
Apparently so.

1164
00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:30,155
I have an idea he thinks he's doing me a favour in publishing my book.

1165
00:57:30,456 --> 00:57:31,809
Oh he doesn't, he couldn't.

1166
00:57:31,894 --> 00:57:34,453
Well, he kind of gave us a work certificate.

1167
00:57:35,152 --> 00:57:37,715
Oh I imagine he rather gathered we didn't approve of it.

1168
00:57:37,715 --> 00:57:38,632
We don't.

1169
00:57:40,352 --> 00:57:41,849
Gotta do something about it Joe.

1170
00:57:41,849 --> 00:57:42,660
Yeah, but...

1171
00:57:44,852 --> 00:57:47,709
he kinda hinted that he might hook up with those pirates, Williams and Marne.

1172
00:57:48,026 --> 00:57:49,076
Oh no!

1173
00:57:49,076 --> 00:57:49,979
Yes!

1174
00:58:03,883 --> 00:58:06,055
Why do you suppose she asked us out here anyway?

1175
00:58:06,627 --> 00:58:08,103
Just to prove we don't belong?

1176
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,627
She isn't a bad sort.

1177
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,576
You know I have quite a long talk with her tonight.

1178
00:58:12,576 --> 00:58:14,480
And she seems like a very nice attractive woman.

1179
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:18,800
So did Delila.

1180
00:58:18,845 --> 00:58:21,015
Ah, Miss Sage,

1181
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:22,856
I wondered where you were.

1182
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:25,080
Joe Anderson Fisk.

1183
00:58:25,465 --> 00:58:27,328
I suppose you've made a good plot tonight

1184
00:58:27,855 --> 00:58:28,309
I...

1185
00:58:28,882 --> 00:58:31,273
Uh, Did I make any plots tonight?

1186
00:58:31,753 --> 00:58:33,145
Oh no, not so far as I know.

1187
00:58:33,523 --> 00:58:35,091
Well, I, I mean for your new novel?

1188
00:58:35,297 --> 00:58:36,248
Oh, oh yes.

1189
00:58:36,248 --> 00:58:38,192
Oh, I know you writer men...

1190
00:58:38,535 --> 00:58:40,465
I bet you're going to use us all for characters.

1191
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,900
Oh, well that's a very good idea.

1192
00:58:43,602 --> 00:58:45,633
Come on, everyone's playing games.

1193
00:58:45,846 --> 00:58:47,571
Oh I'm still reading this thing.

1194
00:58:47,704 --> 00:58:48,913
Isn't it too divine?

1195
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:50,687
I think it's going to be a sensation!

1196
00:58:50,981 --> 00:58:52,564
I'm practically a collaborator on it

1197
00:58:52,648 --> 00:58:55,099
Yes, Grace is my reaction agent.

1198
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,835
She submits to tests.

1199
00:58:56,835 --> 00:58:58,086
I love to!

1200
00:58:58,389 --> 00:58:59,906
Yes, she's my little guinea pig.

1201
00:59:02,631 --> 00:59:04,821
Uhm shall we go play backgammon mr. Fisk?

1202
00:59:05,019 --> 00:59:06,756
Oh yes, I-I'd love to.

1203
00:59:09,797 --> 00:59:11,422
Well how're you getting on with the book?

1204
00:59:11,502 --> 00:59:14,530
Look, is this on the Bantam list you told me to wait for?

1205
00:59:15,348 --> 00:59:16,384
Don't you like it?

1206
00:59:16,755 --> 00:59:18,174
Well it seems awfully

1207
00:59:18,841 --> 00:59:19,885
bright.

1208
00:59:21,128 --> 00:59:23,166
Bright things seem to sell. 
 Yea.

1209
00:59:24,152 --> 00:59:27,709
Look at those great publishers Williams and Warren, they sell millions of copies

1210
00:59:28,641 --> 00:59:29,502
in drugstores.

1211
00:59:31,407 --> 00:59:32,362
What difference does it make

1212
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:33,899
where they sell?

1213
00:59:34,142 --> 00:59:35,066
None

1214
00:59:37,022 --> 00:59:40,530
except if you want to keep your integrity you.

1215
00:59:41,512 --> 00:59:44,247
You-You can't go in for mass production can you?

1216
00:59:44,652 --> 00:59:46,543
I-I mean you can't just become a..

1217
00:59:47,072 --> 00:59:49,167
a little cog in big machinery.

1218
00:59:49,538 --> 00:59:50,447
Can you?

1219
00:59:51,037 --> 00:59:53,000
Don-Don't let's argue about that.

1220
00:59:53,349 --> 00:59:54,169
Oh why not?

1221
00:59:54,169 --> 00:59:56,158
Daisy listen..
Never mind, never mind..

1222
00:59:56,463 --> 00:59:58,986
I just shouldn't have said anything at all until I had read it all through.

1223
00:59:59,479 --> 01:00:01,036
That book will make money.
Money?

1224
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:03,256
Is that so awfully important?

1225
01:00:04,311 --> 01:00:05,759
I haven't got any but you know

1226
01:00:06,007 --> 01:00:07,803
I fee-I feel quite alright.

1227
01:00:10,646 --> 01:00:12,979
Well..you're not a married man.

1228
01:00:14,562 --> 01:00:15,166
No, I..

1229
01:00:16,803 --> 01:00:19,091
I suppose that does make a difference.

1230
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:23,300
Daisy..please read the thing through and give me you're opinion.

1231
01:00:24,029 --> 01:00:27,494
I-I'm not quite sure about it.

1232
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:28,991
You will won't you?

1233
01:00:29,309 --> 01:00:30,574
Oh yes Tom.

1234
01:00:30,863 --> 01:00:34,064
And..And just bare in mind that eh

1235
01:00:35,309 --> 01:00:37,312
Well you can't please everybody.

1236
01:00:55,853 --> 01:00:56,947
Why did she come?

1237
01:00:57,488 --> 01:00:57,884
Who?

1238
01:00:58,915 --> 01:00:59,615
A woman?

1239
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:01,024
Well, I thought you asked her.

1240
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:03,457
First she said she couldn't and then

1241
01:01:03,457 --> 01:01:05,364
she telephoned back she would.

1242
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:07,076
Well...

1243
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:11,950
Well, I'm not the least bit jealous anymore.

1244
01:01:12,576 --> 01:01:14,583
In fact I'm inclined to like her.

1245
01:01:15,587 --> 01:01:16,789
That's big of you Ce.

1246
01:01:18,653 --> 01:01:20,973
I suppose that Joe's one of hers, too.

1247
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:22,500
How do you mean?

1248
01:01:22,821 --> 01:01:24,437
Oh, sweet innocent.

1249
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:25,933
How's that?

1250
01:01:26,469 --> 01:01:28,427
I should think you'd know by now that she's just a

1251
01:01:28,594 --> 01:01:29,734
promiscuous little -

1252
01:01:31,833 --> 01:01:33,038
oh, well.

1253
01:01:34,379 --> 01:01:36,038
You're a strange girl, Ce.

1254
01:01:36,912 --> 01:01:38,129
Pretty cruel one, too.

1255
01:01:39,568 --> 01:01:40,522
Not at all.

1256
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:45,564
In fact, I don't see why Tom and she shouldn't be just as good friends as

1257
01:01:46,292 --> 01:01:48,402
well, as you and I are.

1258
01:01:49,981 --> 01:01:51,443
Their history is a little different.

1259
01:01:52,331 --> 01:01:54,880
Why? Don't you like our history?

1260
01:01:55,576 --> 01:01:56,596
What there is of it.

1261
01:01:57,698 --> 01:01:59,371
A trifle uneventful, don't you think?

1262
01:02:00,605 --> 01:02:01,719
Or shall we simply call it

1263
01:02:02,523 --> 01:02:03,806
'lacking in excitement'?

1264
01:02:13,114 --> 01:02:15,368
You've been so strange, lately.

1265
01:02:15,977 --> 01:02:17,410
So remote.

1266
01:02:18,263 --> 01:02:19,694
I wasn't aware of it.

1267
01:02:20,854 --> 01:02:23,850
Refusing to help us sell Tom's press to Williams and Warren.

1268
01:02:25,524 --> 01:02:29,648
But Tom - Tom doesn't want to be helped.

1269
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:32,750
I do.

1270
01:02:38,053 --> 01:02:39,539
Good heavens, darling, I've told

1271
01:02:39,539 --> 01:02:42,105
you a dozen times I'm counsel for them.

1272
01:02:42,573 --> 01:02:43,830
They do exactly as you tell them.

1273
01:02:45,535 --> 01:02:46,657
Hang it all, Ce.

1274
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:48,562
Tom doesn't <i>want</i> to sell the Bantam!

1275
01:02:49,321 --> 01:02:51,188
Tom doesn't know <i>what</i> he wants.

1276
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,969
Just one little word from you.

1277
01:02:54,992 --> 01:02:57,439
Well, you know, there's a thing called 'legal ethics'.

1278
01:02:58,064 --> 01:02:59,799
There's a thing called 'friendship'.

1279
01:03:02,703 --> 01:03:03,540
Oh, and

1280
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,300
'lacking in excitement', you said. For you?

1281
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,000
For you, I meant.

1282
01:03:12,642 --> 01:03:14,638
And I suppose you're the judge of that, too?

1283
01:03:15,052 --> 01:03:16,480
Well, I don't know who else.

1284
01:03:17,613 --> 01:03:20,107
And of course, you couldn't <i>possibly</i> be wrong.

1285
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,037
Could I?

1286
01:03:22,685 --> 01:03:24,366
And I'm not a human being at all,

1287
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:25,427
of course.

1288
01:03:26,265 --> 01:03:28,508
Ce - Ce!

1289
01:03:29,233 --> 01:03:30,750
You will do this one thing for me?

1290
01:03:31,162 --> 01:03:32,593
One word to Williams and Warren?

1291
01:03:38,174 --> 01:03:39,279
Owen,

1292
01:03:41,923 --> 01:03:43,088
Yes.

1293
01:03:44,864 --> 01:03:46,593
Darling.

1294
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,500
Oh, Miss Sage.

1295
01:03:55,179 --> 01:03:57,776
Owen and I have been discussing something that might interest you.

1296
01:03:58,075 --> 01:03:59,456
He's promised to use his influence to have

1297
01:03:59,456 --> 01:04:01,613
Williams and Warren take over the Bantam press.

1298
01:04:01,885 --> 01:04:03,024
Isn't that splendid?

1299
01:04:04,358 --> 01:04:05,404
Did Tom -

1300
01:04:07,104 --> 01:04:08,325
Is it all settled?

1301
01:04:08,698 --> 01:04:09,687
Owen's arranged it.

1302
01:04:09,991 --> 01:04:11,144
See, he's their lawyer.

1303
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:13,285
Isn't that nice of him?

1304
01:04:13,406 --> 01:04:15,946
Well, if there's any credit due, i"m sure it's Cecilia's.

1305
01:04:16,688 --> 01:04:18,788
Oh, yes, I'm sure it is.

1306
01:04:20,105 --> 01:04:23,853
Will you excuse me? I was just looking for Miss Schmidt.

1307
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Frank, Jo -

1308
01:04:38,052 --> 01:04:40,650
Look, do you mind going in tonight?

1309
01:04:40,972 --> 01:04:42,989
Buy why? 
We were supposed to spend the night!

1310
01:04:43,128 --> 01:04:44,497
Yes, I know we were, but

1311
01:04:44,844 --> 01:04:47,128
I've just got to get out of this house. 
But Dais-
No!

1312
01:04:47,369 --> 01:04:48,149
We are going.

1313
01:04:48,278 --> 01:04:49,493
Get your things together.

1314
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,517
Okay.

1315
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:53,400
Okay gee, when the part's getting good.

1316
01:05:10,704 --> 01:05:13,017
I'm sorry, Mrs Collier, it just can't be helped.

1317
01:05:13,379 --> 01:05:14,858
Are you ready, Joe? 
Yes.

1318
01:05:15,339 --> 01:05:16,605
Goodbye - thank you very much.

1319
01:05:16,897 --> 01:05:17,664
Goodbye, Tom.

1320
01:05:17,933 --> 01:05:18,620
Goodbye.

1321
01:05:20,388 --> 01:05:22,333
I must say, your leaving seems very strange.

1322
01:05:22,433 --> 01:05:23,703
We so loved having you.

1323
01:05:23,824 --> 01:05:25,933
You were very kind to ask us. 
Goodbye, Tom.
'bye.

1324
01:05:26,368 --> 01:05:28,119
Goodbye, Mrs. Collier. 
Goodbye

1325
01:05:28,227 --> 01:05:30,225
Come again when you can really stay.
Thank you.

1326
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:31,805
I'll see about the car.

1327
01:05:32,751 --> 01:05:36,001
Well, all so solemn.

1328
01:05:36,877 --> 01:05:38,346
I know you don't like my friends.

1329
01:05:38,579 --> 01:05:40,015
Your-
 They are, however.

1330
01:05:40,831 --> 01:05:42,553
I know you don't like the book I'm publishing.

1331
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:46,825
Tom, I pity you with all my heart.

1332
01:05:47,163 --> 01:05:48,144
Pity me?

1333
01:05:49,073 --> 01:05:50,067
What are you talking about?

1334
01:05:51,564 --> 01:05:53,628
I came to find out, and I found out.

1335
01:05:54,339 --> 01:05:55,353
Now I'm going.

1336
01:05:55,353 --> 01:05:56,231
Found out what?

1337
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:57,780
Pity me, why?

1338
01:05:58,386 --> 01:05:59,548
Do you mind?

1339
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:02,795
Daisy, I-

1340
01:06:06,112 --> 01:06:07,550
Give us a kiss, Daisy.

1341
01:06:08,147 --> 01:06:09,328
Hey, Daisy -

1342
01:06:09,643 --> 01:06:11,615
Hurry up or we'll miss the train.

1343
01:06:11,891 --> 01:06:13,207
C'mon, here's your coat, get in.

1344
01:06:13,513 --> 01:06:15,445
You must give us a ring sometime, Tom.

1345
01:06:15,547 --> 01:06:16,096
Right.

1346
01:06:16,468 --> 01:06:17,780
I'll wait for you outside.

1347
01:06:23,851 --> 01:06:24,840
Goodbye, Tom.

1348
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,200
Once I wouldn't say it, would I?

1349
01:06:29,845 --> 01:06:31,051
Once you wouldn't.

1350
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:35,224
Well, goodbye.

1351
01:06:38,677 --> 01:06:39,909
This time you do.

1352
01:06:42,205 --> 01:06:43,118
Goodbye.

1353
01:07:00,410 --> 01:07:01,800
Well, goodnight my dear.

1354
01:07:02,668 --> 01:07:04,072
I had a lovely time.

1355
01:07:04,397 --> 01:07:05,326
I'll miss you.

1356
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,138
Good night Tom. 
 Goodnight.

1357
01:07:13,616 --> 01:07:14,718
Good night, father!

1358
01:07:23,810 --> 01:07:24,674
Well?

1359
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,300
Oh, yes.

1360
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:38,683
Why you declined to spend the winter in town with your father is-

1361
01:07:38,683 --> 01:07:39,334
Is what?

1362
01:07:40,122 --> 01:07:41,810
You must simply wish to be disagreeable.

1363
01:07:41,929 --> 01:07:42,891
That isn't true.

1364
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,687
Aw, come on, Ce, now, let's forget that.

1365
01:07:44,833 --> 01:07:46,174
As if that was so easy.

1366
01:07:46,773 --> 01:07:48,225
I suppose you refused to sell the Press.

1367
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,200
Even if Williams and Warren are willing to pay twice what it's worth.

1368
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,400
I don't know.

1369
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,700
Can't we talk about something else tonight?

1370
01:07:55,842 --> 01:07:57,080
I'm afraid not.

1371
01:08:31,831 --> 01:08:32,981
Oh, hello, Ce.

1372
01:08:32,981 --> 01:08:34,375
You're frighteningly late, darling.

1373
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:36,730
I stopped at the bank.

1374
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:38,462
What made you do that, silly?

1375
01:08:38,905 --> 01:08:40,978
I don't know. I just went to think.

1376
01:08:42,709 --> 01:08:43,851
Try to clear my mind with a vision of...

1377
01:08:43,955 --> 01:08:46,662
vision of millions and millions of people.

1378
01:08:46,769 --> 01:08:50,563
Williamson's recital of the glories of the machine age.

1379
01:08:51,234 --> 01:08:52,368
I stopped with the press.

1380
01:08:52,903 --> 01:08:54,065
It went alright, didn't it?

1381
01:08:54,521 --> 01:08:55,481
Oh yes perfect.

1382
01:08:55,691 --> 01:08:56,877
In fact it's settled.

1383
01:08:57,591 --> 01:08:58,576
- Not already? 
 - Yes...

1384
01:08:58,708 --> 01:08:59,648
Yes they've signed.

1385
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:03,045
All I have to do now is dig out a notary in the village...

1386
01:09:03,703 --> 01:09:05,673
Write my name under theirs.

1387
01:09:08,013 --> 01:09:10,002
- Are you pleased? 
 Aren't you?

1388
01:09:11,409 --> 01:09:13,972
No, I think something's happened to my nervous system.

1389
01:09:15,272 --> 01:09:16,626
I feel awfully light.

1390
01:09:16,753 --> 01:09:18,494
Of course you're famished.

1391
01:09:19,192 --> 01:09:20,289
Come and eat.

1392
01:09:22,396 --> 01:09:23,916
You like to eat in my sitting room?

1393
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:25,259
Alright.

1394
01:09:25,384 --> 01:09:26,721
I'll call Regan.

1395
01:09:29,385 --> 01:09:30,311
- Ce. 
 - Yes.

1396
01:09:30,311 --> 01:09:31,073
Yes.

1397
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,300
I think it's time we had a child or two Ce.

1398
01:09:38,116 --> 01:09:39,534
We'll talk about that.

1399
01:09:40,526 --> 01:09:41,438
We must.

1400
01:09:53,592 --> 01:09:55,291
They're all ready Tom.

1401
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:02,303
I thought it would be so cozy us dining here.

1402
01:10:07,104 --> 01:10:08,241
What's the matter?

1403
01:10:09,578 --> 01:10:10,461
Honey.

1404
01:10:11,368 --> 01:10:14,421
You know, the lighting this way, it reminds me of some place

1405
01:10:14,878 --> 01:10:15,542
What?

1406
01:10:17,193 --> 01:10:18,253
Hmm.

1407
01:10:19,418 --> 01:10:20,769
Champagne, is it?

1408
01:10:21,305 --> 01:10:22,842
Don't you feel like celebrating?

1409
01:10:22,943 --> 01:10:23,961
Very well.

1410
01:10:24,527 --> 01:10:26,066
A little wine, won't hurt you?

1411
01:10:26,585 --> 01:10:28,271
The little more and how much it is.

1412
01:10:29,817 --> 01:10:30,669
Fill 'em Mr. Regan

1413
01:10:38,545 --> 01:10:39,742
Infinite riches...

1414
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:41,203
In a little room.

1415
01:10:41,547 --> 01:10:43,018
You got the quote badly.

1416
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,365
The little lamb who made me.

1417
01:10:45,085 --> 01:10:46,604
Regan doust though know who made me.

1418
01:10:51,797 --> 01:10:53,094
Easy to remind, you know?

1419
01:10:55,148 --> 01:10:56,357
And his little morals.

1420
01:11:11,576 --> 01:11:13,335
The discrete withdrawal.

1421
01:11:14,205 --> 01:11:15,909
I've seen that before too.

1422
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:18,684
I know the florentine.

1423
01:11:19,533 --> 01:11:21,365
A private room at the Florentine.

1424
01:11:21,365 --> 01:11:22,200
What's that?

1425
01:11:23,083 --> 01:11:24,408
It's a hotel...

1426
01:11:25,394 --> 01:11:27,291
run by a woman called Flora Carniver

1427
01:11:27,633 --> 01:11:28,688
Sounds wicked.

1428
01:11:28,801 --> 01:11:30,683
It used to be the best place in London.

1429
01:11:31,469 --> 01:11:33,134
Place, what sort of place?

1430
01:11:34,104 --> 01:11:35,179
Twenty guineas.

1431
01:11:35,931 --> 01:11:37,076
Twenty guineas?

1432
01:11:38,568 --> 01:11:39,608
On the mantelpiece.

1433
01:11:41,553 --> 01:11:42,664
What are you talking about?

1434
01:11:42,801 --> 01:11:44,403
In advance at that.

1435
01:11:45,594 --> 01:11:46,728
Well expensive, isn't it?

1436
01:11:48,047 --> 01:11:49,799
Well, I went to Florence to celebrate.

1437
01:11:49,926 --> 01:11:52,541
Food was good, waiter discreet, the wine excellent.

1438
01:11:53,071 --> 01:11:56,406
Lady...most artful.

1439
01:11:57,523 --> 01:11:58,930
I don't care to hear about it, thank you.

1440
01:12:00,242 --> 01:12:02,353
See your eyes are so bright.

1441
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,274
Ahh... eat you.

1442
01:12:04,688 --> 01:12:06,051
Seeing things.

1443
01:12:07,121 --> 01:12:09,147
- Ce. 
 - Yes dear.

1444
01:12:09,384 --> 01:12:12,137
You know, little love is no love.

1445
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:14,218
Meaning what, precisely?

1446
01:12:15,484 --> 01:12:18,301
Wasn't necessary to lock your door against me last night.

1447
01:12:18,992 --> 01:12:19,808
But I didn't.

1448
01:12:20,186 --> 01:12:21,992
I mean, not against...
Then why?

1449
01:12:22,908 --> 01:12:24,319
Tell me instantly why it was.

1450
01:12:24,829 --> 01:12:26,148
That an order?
Tell me.

1451
01:12:27,005 --> 01:12:29,831
You mean... Why I didn't near me?
Yes.

1452
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:33,086
You've been constantly disagreable, that's all.

1453
01:12:33,226 --> 01:12:34,851
About what, what wanting Regan back?

1454
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:36,038
- That's one thing. 
 - Well what else then?

1455
01:12:36,238 --> 01:12:37,340
Your father chiefly.

1456
01:12:45,448 --> 01:12:47,592
What are you going to do about your birthday check Tom?

1457
01:12:49,377 --> 01:12:51,623
Well... oh that... well.

1458
01:12:52,086 --> 01:12:53,702
Well, I...

1459
01:12:54,312 --> 01:12:57,121
I don't know whether to send it back or just not to cash it.

1460
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:00,705
Of course you simply can't allow yourself to show any graciousness towards him.

1461
01:13:01,347 --> 01:13:02,187
No.

1462
01:13:03,162 --> 01:13:05,471
It's a way of telling you how pleased with you he is.

1463
01:13:05,595 --> 01:13:08,486
He gives you a small check and you have the extraordinary bad taste...

1464
01:13:10,065 --> 01:13:10,708
What?

1465
01:13:11,264 --> 01:13:12,725
Good heavens.

1466
01:13:13,629 --> 01:13:14,700
I can't believe it.

1467
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:15,543
There it is.

1468
01:13:17,306 --> 01:13:18,916
There isn't that much money in the world.

1469
01:13:19,419 --> 01:13:20,647
In father's world there is.

1470
01:13:21,269 --> 01:13:23,563
He fells he can afford it to get us to come and live with him.

1471
01:13:23,794 --> 01:13:26,141
Of course I can't understand your attitude about that either.

1472
01:13:26,852 --> 01:13:28,125
- Don't you Ce? 
 - No.

1473
01:13:28,749 --> 01:13:30,964
He knows how inconvenient it is here in the winter.

1474
01:13:31,428 --> 01:13:33,572
And having that great huge lovely house in town is...

1475
01:13:33,693 --> 01:13:35,570
perfectly sweet and natural of him to ask us.

1476
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:37,300
Well to us.

1477
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,700
Yes you to preside night after night at his deadly dinners.

1478
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:45,000
Me to listen eternally to his advice on what to do and how to live.

1479
01:13:45,366 --> 01:13:47,237
To give up what little integrity I have left.

1480
01:13:48,372 --> 01:13:49,958
Taught to allow him to own us.

1481
01:13:50,714 --> 01:13:53,221
Of course he's willing to pay. He always is.

1482
01:14:01,076 --> 01:14:03,257
How can you be so hard about him I don't know.

1483
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:04,339
- Why we are thinking of the perfect... br&gt; - Hold it.

1484
01:14:04,339 --> 01:14:05,826
Oh let's stop it Ce.

1485
01:14:06,489 --> 01:14:08,109
Very well. We shall.

1486
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:17,800
Now you're gone from me again.

1487
01:14:18,472 --> 01:14:19,510
What you care.

1488
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:23,315
Oh Ce, my lovely Ce. Where are you? What's become of you?

1489
01:14:24,279 --> 01:14:25,658
The thing you call your integrity...

1490
01:14:25,783 --> 01:14:26,836
That's the word.

1491
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:31,500
It is no use talking.

1492
01:14:34,842 --> 01:14:36,593
Is this what you call be disagreeable I suppose?

1493
01:14:36,874 --> 01:14:38,047
Yes. Very.

1494
01:14:38,047 --> 01:14:39,437
How to be other wise then.

1495
01:14:39,692 --> 01:14:42,748
Possibly by being the fine, kind, generous man you ought to be.

1496
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:46,000
Accept the cheque with thanks, and go and live with him.

1497
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:48,100
It's only for a few months.

1498
01:14:48,518 --> 01:14:51,021
I think to refuse his presence would be extremely bad manners.

1499
01:14:51,156 --> 01:14:53,958
Just about in a class with those of your ex-sweetheart.

1500
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,700
Why I'm sorry. I didn't mean.

1501
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,600
Nevermind.

1502
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:11,500
Ce. Suppose I should do what you say about father.

1503
01:15:12,997 --> 01:15:14,223
Oh, Tom.

1504
01:15:15,573 --> 01:15:17,405
You'll be the darling, I know you are.

1505
01:15:18,257 --> 01:15:19,643
Would you like me better?

1506
01:15:19,643 --> 01:15:20,527
Much.

1507
01:15:21,489 --> 01:15:22,424
How much?

1508
01:15:22,862 --> 01:15:24,064
Oh, very much.

1509
01:15:24,944 --> 01:15:27,795
No...Lock doors anymore.

1510
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:29,738
Not one ever.

1511
01:15:31,574 --> 01:15:32,919
That was the most inviting.

1512
01:15:33,376 --> 01:15:34,032
Darling.

1513
01:15:35,032 --> 01:15:38,995
And suddenly I'm beginning to see with awful clearness.

1514
01:15:39,657 --> 01:15:40,684
What?

1515
01:15:41,665 --> 01:15:43,274
How stupid you've been.

1516
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:44,700
Well, I am too.

1517
01:15:46,836 --> 01:15:47,682
Yes.

1518
01:15:49,661 --> 01:15:51,210
Well you are going to be nice again.

1519
01:15:52,102 --> 01:15:53,080
You'll see.

1520
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:58,800
I want to feel, I don't know. Together again.

1521
01:15:59,306 --> 01:16:00,716
As we used to.

1522
01:16:03,161 --> 01:16:04,362
You're very pretty, you know?

1523
01:16:04,979 --> 01:16:06,301
Oh, thank you sir.

1524
01:16:06,629 --> 01:16:08,028
Very exciting too.

1525
01:16:09,212 --> 01:16:10,778
I don't know if it's you or the wine speaking.

1526
01:16:10,913 --> 01:16:12,664
Oh me... me through the wine.

1527
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:14,737
Shall we have a little more?

1528
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:15,581
I think so.

1529
01:16:15,925 --> 01:16:17,071
It's a party then.

1530
01:16:17,446 --> 01:16:18,321
It's a party!

1531
01:16:18,456 --> 01:16:20,270
We'll have another small bottle.

1532
01:16:21,819 --> 01:16:23,079
There's some here.

1533
01:16:27,703 --> 01:16:29,641
- Sometimes you're so thrilling Tom. 
 - You think?

1534
01:16:29,641 --> 01:16:30,389
You think?

1535
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,600
We shouldn't. You know we shouldn't.

1536
01:16:33,824 --> 01:16:36,180
Uh... we seem to be.

1537
01:16:38,134 --> 01:16:39,474
All at once.

1538
01:16:39,848 --> 01:16:41,912
I feel terribly naughty, somehow.

1539
01:16:43,102 --> 01:16:44,937
You know, I suppose you're one of the most

1540
01:16:45,293 --> 01:16:47,029
Prettiest girl I have ever seen.

1541
01:16:47,483 --> 01:16:49,222
So nice of you to think so, sir.

1542
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:50,715
So very attractive.

1543
01:16:51,523 --> 01:16:52,572
I like to be attractive.

1544
01:16:52,887 --> 01:16:55,657
So very alluring.

1545
01:16:56,730 --> 01:16:57,793
There, that's enough.

1546
01:16:57,929 --> 01:16:59,081
A strange woman.

1547
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:01,532
Your lips drop honeycomb.

1548
01:17:01,848 --> 01:17:03,982
Your mouth is smoother than oil.

1549
01:17:04,415 --> 01:17:05,950
Now why are you pouting?

1550
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:10,511
Ah, the discreet waiter returns.

1551
01:17:10,944 --> 01:17:11,796
Come in.

1552
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,080
Give the lady some waiter.

1553
01:17:25,622 --> 01:17:27,251
You leave the bottle on the table.

1554
01:17:29,286 --> 01:17:30,392
That'll be all.

1555
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:39,083
To the...pleasant ways of life.

1556
01:17:39,536 --> 01:17:41,127
Such pleasant ways.

1557
01:17:44,773 --> 01:17:45,986
It's good, isn't it?

1558
01:17:46,631 --> 01:17:47,560
So good.

1559
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:50,742
I'm beginning to feel it a little.

1560
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:52,494
That's what it's for, right?

1561
01:17:52,639 --> 01:17:54,205
It must be.

1562
01:17:54,353 --> 01:17:57,426
Champagne, the friend of lovers.

1563
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:03,077
No. Not yet.

1564
01:18:03,742 --> 01:18:05,449
Artful child.

1565
01:18:05,911 --> 01:18:06,850
You think?

1566
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:09,053
Lovely endearing thing.

1567
01:18:10,613 --> 01:18:12,092
I like you too.

1568
01:18:12,385 --> 01:18:14,784
It's pleasant here, isn't it?

1569
01:18:15,864 --> 01:18:17,025
So pleasant.

1570
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:20,762
You're not taking any?

1571
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:21,716
No.

1572
01:18:22,056 --> 01:18:24,791
It makes me see most too clearly.

1573
01:18:25,417 --> 01:18:29,454
Oh. Take a little more, everything will get so...

1574
01:18:29,766 --> 01:18:32,087
So lovely and vague.

1575
01:18:33,416 --> 01:18:35,263
The way I feel now.

1576
01:18:35,752 --> 01:18:37,617
A good feeling, is it?

1577
01:18:38,382 --> 01:18:40,495
Delicious.

1578
01:18:42,637 --> 01:18:44,002
Oh, Tom.

1579
01:18:46,005 --> 01:18:47,927
One last toast.

1580
01:18:49,656 --> 01:18:51,197
Do we dare?

1581
01:18:52,532 --> 01:18:53,607
Come on...

1582
01:18:57,043 --> 01:18:58,592
But to what?

1583
01:18:59,813 --> 01:19:00,963
What to?

1584
01:19:01,951 --> 01:19:03,679
You name it.

1585
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:05,333
To love

1586
01:19:16,728 --> 01:19:17,905
and darling . . .

1587
01:19:18,788 --> 01:19:19,787
Yes?

1588
01:19:20,515 --> 01:19:23,868
You are going to be an angel aren't you?

1589
01:19:25,804 --> 01:19:26,910
You'll see

1590
01:19:27,369 --> 01:19:28,812
I knew you would

1591
01:19:29,597 --> 01:19:31,125
I'm so happy

1592
01:19:34,785 --> 01:19:37,381
I want you close to me

1593
01:19:51,644 --> 01:19:53,429
Don't be long

1594
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:27,600
Come in

1595
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:32,400
- See here Red. 
 - Never mind.

1596
01:20:33,612 --> 01:20:36,398
All I mean is, well I'm out for good this time.

1597
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:38,111
Why?

1598
01:20:38,599 --> 01:20:40,158
I just don't like it here, that's all.

1599
01:20:41,559 --> 01:20:42,566
When you want to go?

1600
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:44,100
As soon as I can

1601
01:20:45,117 --> 01:20:45,924
Tonight then.

1602
01:20:46,536 --> 01:20:47,539
That's alright with me.

1603
01:20:48,073 --> 01:20:48,903
I'm packed.

1604
01:20:50,507 --> 01:20:51,607
Wait downstairs.

1605
01:20:54,026 --> 01:20:54,906
Oh Red!

1606
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:58,118
Have you got a fountain-pen?

1607
01:21:02,348 --> 01:21:03,095
Thanks.

1608
01:21:04,059 --> 01:21:05,398
Don't let me forget to return it.

1609
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:01,454
On the mantlepiece.

1610
01:22:18,232 --> 01:22:19,788
Oh here you are Red.

1611
01:22:25,321 --> 01:22:25,989
Thank you

1612
01:22:27,437 --> 01:22:28,404
Well

1613
01:22:29,129 --> 01:22:29,677
Goodbye.

1614
01:22:31,286 --> 01:22:32,533
Go get in the car

1615
01:22:33,269 --> 01:22:34,452
I can walk to the train alright

1616
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,200
Bring my hat and coat.

1617
01:22:39,968 --> 01:22:41,897
You bring my hat and coat, please?

1618
01:23:02,352 --> 01:23:03,538
What's the idea?

1619
01:23:04,619 --> 01:23:05,658
Light please.

1620
01:23:20,656 --> 01:23:21,625
Now then

1621
01:23:21,778 --> 01:23:23,609
I can walk I tell you.

1622
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,358
Not at all, we are driving.

1623
01:23:25,813 --> 01:23:26,617
We will?

1624
01:23:28,096 --> 01:23:29,896
I'm going back to my wife Fred.

1625
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:31,781
To your?

1626
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:36,552
My wife I say
