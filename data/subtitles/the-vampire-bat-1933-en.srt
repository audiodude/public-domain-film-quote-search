Oh, uh, how about Martha?

His eyes burned up
like coals of fire.

00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,520
His hand reached
out toward me, as

00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,470
An animal of some sort.

It's hard to say.

395

The fangs of a wolf, perhaps.

A werewolf.

397
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:12,180
Could they have been made
by, well, a bat, for instance?

DR. VON NIEMANN: A

another flower, Kringen.

Oh, you don't mind me

Not at all, Frau Schnappman.

What seems to be the
ailment this morning?

477
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,650
Well, Doctor, I
am positive that I

478
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:59,160
Have valvular
disease of the aorta.

479
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,530
Or maybe it's the, um,
the right ventricle.

480
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,500
Hm.

481
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,150
Well, there's something
wrong with my heart.

482
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,300
I can hear it beat
thump, thump, thump,

483
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,250
Thump, just like the book says.

484
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,150
Well, if you didn't hear it
beating thump, thump, thump,

485
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:15,050
Just as the book says, I would
say there is something wrong.

486
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:15,970
What?

487
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,390
Without a moon?

488
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,940
You have a heart of stone.

489
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,760

close your eyes.

490
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:25,870

What time was that?

About two or three

in the garden this morning.

I was in my room reading.

My door was open.

I must have dozed off

You say your door was open?

Yes, my room was very
poorly ventilated.

Without a doubt.

How in the world
did it get here?

Herman Gleib was in her room.

He had that crucifix
in his hands.

It looks as if Herman Gleib

Murderers leave clues!

984
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,890
And these atrocities
are murders, Doctor.

985

Those simple fools

And you know and I know,
Doctor, that these are murders!

989
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:30,670
The last one was done
here, in this very house,

990
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:33,060
Right under this roof.

All right, I'll start here.

00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:37,390
I'm going over every
foot of this place,

Both inside and out.

994
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:40,710
Nobody, sane or insane,
is clever enough

00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:43,350
To get away with murder without
leaving a clue of some sort!

996
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:45,140
And I'm going to find that clue!

you a good night's sleep.

If there are any clues,
they'll be here in the morning

Ruth, didn't I tell you
to stay in your room?

1006

Yes, but I wanted the doctor
to come up and quiet Auntie.

You know, it isn't her

Mad?

No mere crystalline growth, but
