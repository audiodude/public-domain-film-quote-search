1
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,963
<i>Dense forest once
covered all of Piney Ridge,</i>

2
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,885
<i>but no longer is the
region a mystery.</i>

3
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,000
<i>Modern highways have
penetrated the darkness,</i>

4
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:25,001
<i>and brought in the light.</i>

5
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,725
<i>Not so in Ox Head
Woods, further south.</i>

6
00:01:28,115 --> 00:01:30,566
<i>Step into it off the abandoned
road that hugs its length,</i>

7
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:35,251
<i>and it's like passing through a wall
and closing the door behind you.</i>

8
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,264
<i>Obsolete trails wonder vaguely, crisscross,
or break at right angles for no reason.</i>

9
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,423
<i>Only one leads to
the Morgan farm.</i>

10
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,481
<i>Pete Morgan's farm has
the allure of a wall castle</i>

11
00:01:48,482 --> 00:01:52,282
<i>that everybody knows about,
but few have entered.</i>

12
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:57,959
<i>Its only access to the outside world
is a country road that passes by.</i>

13
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,703
<i>Some miles north connects with
the highway near the Renton farm.</i>

14
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,202
<i>Joe Renton, like the other farmers
here abouts, is up and coming,</i>

15
00:02:06,203 --> 00:02:07,903
<i>raises good apples.</i>

16
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,410
<i>Fine soil everywhere
in the valley.</i>

17
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,765
<i>The young people for miles
around come to the high school.</i>

18
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,043
<i>The boys graduate a little older
than those in the city.</i>

19
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,666
<i>That's because they take time out for
planting and helping with the harvest.</i>

20
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,419
<i>They're a healthy lot.</i>

21
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,866
<i>And girls don't come
prettier any place.</i>

22
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,683
Are we going swimming Sunday?

23
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,969
Sure, if I'm not
needed at the store.

24
00:02:51,025 --> 00:02:53,348
Where do you change into
your swimming trunks?

25
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:55,019
Mmm, maybe I'll wear them over.

26
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,406
No.

27
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,761
Bring them.
We'll change at the reservoir.

28
00:02:59,953 --> 00:03:01,659
Who else is coming?

29
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,260
Just us.

30
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,048
<i>Hi Teller,
how's hunting?</i>

31
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,127
Bye, kids. Miss me.

32
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,646
What are you doing so
close to civilization?

33
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,639
You're growing up, Tibby.

34
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,623
- You're almost a woman.
- Almost! I'm woman enough already.

35
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,151
I wouldn't say that.

36
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,170
Oh, what do you know about anything,
you never got past the ninth grade.

37
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,766
I'm good at plenty of things
they don't teach in school.

38
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,780
What's got into you, Meg?
You got the fidgets?

39
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,839
I promised Pete Morgan I'd bring you by the farm
this afternoon, and I don't know how to ask you.

40
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,744
Looks like you've
asked me already.

41
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,644
What does he want?

42
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,484
You better ask him.

43
00:04:21,715 --> 00:04:23,519
Well, how long will it take?

44
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,267
Not too awfully long, Nath.

45
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,262
We're here already.

46
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,080
OK, Meg, let's go.

47
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,380
Hey, Nath, what's Tibby
going to say about this?

48
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,981
<i>What do you think she'll do?</i>

49
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,909
Pete?

50
00:05:08,134 --> 00:05:09,579
Yes, Meg.

51
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,351
I brought Nath Storm,
the boy I told you about.

52
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,600
You know, I've...

53
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:29,101
I've thought
about this thing, Meg.

54
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,229
I'm not so sure
it's a good thing.

55
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,666
We've been content with
the way things were.

56
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:37,156
Maybe an outsider will spoil it.

57
00:05:37,757 --> 00:05:42,839
But it would be so much easier for you if Nath
would come and help out at the end of the day.

58
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,642
- Anything between you and Nath?
- Oh, no.

59
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,804
He and Tibby Renton
are going steady.

60
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,049
All right, I'll see the boy.

61
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,490
Never could turn
you down, could I?

62
00:06:12,982 --> 00:06:15,689
Meg says good things
about you, Nath.

63
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,779
Maybe you're not as
stocky as you might be.

64
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,891
Stopped growing too
soon, Mr. Morgan.

65
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,504
- How's your mother's store getting along?
- Oh well, some days we don't even make a $1.

66
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,508
What did you want to see
me about, Mr. Morgan?

67
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,244
You know about my leg?

68
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,529
Wood.

69
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,829
My sister and Meg have
got a curious idea that

70
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,530
it's hard to climb a ladder
with a wooden leg.

71
00:06:44,817 --> 00:06:46,517
- Well, it isn't.
- No, sir.

72
00:06:46,518 --> 00:06:51,301
What's more, they've got an idea that
things are getting a little run down here,

73
00:06:51,302 --> 00:06:53,191
can't do as much as I used to.

74
00:06:53,192 --> 00:06:55,759
So they've talked me
into hiring somebody.

75
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,301
Eh, help along with
the evening chores.

76
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,031
I'll pay $0.35 an hour.

77
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:08,926
Could you make it 4 bits?

78
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:11,736
It's over an hour's
walk home afterwards.

79
00:07:12,137 --> 00:07:14,819
Yeah, I hadn't thought of that.

80
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,807
- I'll pay $0.50 a hour.
- Could he start today?

81
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,610
- Sure it's all right with you, Meg?
- Oh, yes.

82
00:07:27,611 --> 00:07:29,211
Thanks!

83
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,560
<i>Come on, Nath.</i>

84
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,967
Ellen?

85
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,527
Ellen!

86
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,986
- He's hired Nath.
- Good.

87
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,479
I just hope that Pete hasn't become
too used to doing things alone.

88
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,947
I do hope it works out.

89
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:20,195
- You sure you don't want any more, Nath?
- No, thanks, ma'am.

90
00:08:20,696 --> 00:08:23,759
Bet nobody'll believe me when
I tell them I had supper here.

91
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,950
Why not, Nath?

92
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,885
Well, didn't you know you
and Miss Ellen are known as...

93
00:08:28,886 --> 00:08:30,857
the mysterious Morgans?

94
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:33,299
Are we?

95
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,701
Well, they won't
say it anymore.

96
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:37,406
Not when I tell them what a
swell layout you've got here.

97
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:39,811
And that you spread the
best table in the valley.

98
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:42,614
It's because we're so
self-sufficient here.

99
00:08:42,915 --> 00:08:45,719
We seldom have any
need to go to town.

100
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,603
What else do they
say about us, Nath?

101
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,667
Oh, nothing.

102
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,260
Except things like...

103
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:57,461
Meg not being your daughter,

104
00:08:57,462 --> 00:08:59,162
or even related.

105
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,570
Why don't they ask me?

106
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,760
Well I... I guess they'd rather whisper
gossip than find out the truth.

107
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:09,661
What gossip?

108
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,000
Well, they say...

109
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:18,001
Meg's mother and father ran away
and left her when she was still a baby.

110
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,845
Well, that's not true, Nath.

111
00:09:20,846 --> 00:09:23,977
Meg's mother and father went
down south to find a new farm.

112
00:09:23,978 --> 00:09:27,387
- They left Meg in our care.
- They died down there in a runaway.

113
00:09:27,388 --> 00:09:31,873
Pete and I adopted Meg legally. There's
nothing to be whispered about, Nath.

114
00:09:31,874 --> 00:09:33,419
She was only two
years old then.

115
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,868
There's nothing wrong
with being adopted.

116
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,961
I'm grateful.

117
00:09:38,462 --> 00:09:39,962
Sure.

118
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:48,143
And the next time I hear anybody
gossiping about it, I'll say, so what?

119
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,909
Meg isn't the only
adopted girl in the world.

120
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,404
Well, I... I hate to eat and run, folks,
but... I think I better get started.

121
00:10:16,852 --> 00:10:21,019
It's kind of late so I thought I'd take
a shortcut through Ox Head Woods.

122
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:26,227
- You know your way through those woods?
- No, but the winds cleared the sky.

123
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,410
Well, I'd take the long
way around if I were you.

124
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:34,193
I've owned the Ox Head
Woods for years and...

125
00:10:34,594 --> 00:10:38,662
I'm as brave as the next man, but I wouldn't
cross through those woods at night.

126
00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:41,289
The woods haven't scared
me since I was a kid.

127
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,413
- Day or night.
- But you said you didn't know Ox Head Woods.

128
00:10:44,414 --> 00:10:47,459
- A tree is a tree, and a trail is a trail.
- The trails lead nowhere.

129
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,724
- Let the boy go, Pete.
- I don't want him to get lost.

130
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,699
- Close the door, Pete.
- I don't want him to get hurt.

131
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,931
Wait, don't take the Ox Head Woods.
The foot bridge across the creek is out.

132
00:10:58,932 --> 00:11:00,779
- I'll jump across.
- Well there's bog on the other side.

133
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,125
I'll find my way around it.
Look, Mr. Morgan, I can't...

134
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:06,049
- It's a long way around.
- I'll save two miles by cutting through the woods.

135
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:10,059
But you won't save yourself from the screams
in the night, It'll lodge in your bones all your life.

136
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,810
- Screams from where?
- From the red house.

137
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,742
Well, if I come to it,
I'll give it a wide go by.

138
00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:20,443
You can't!

139
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,383
Did you ever run
away from the scream?

140
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,503
Hey Nath!

141
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,141
It will follow you
through the woods.

142
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,630
It will follow you
all of your life.

143
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,026
Nath! Nath!

144
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:38,322
What did you say to him?

145
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:40,885
Nath's a brave lad,
but he's fooled.

146
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,312
I warned him but
he wouldn't listen.

147
00:12:43,613 --> 00:12:46,059
You warned him against what?

148
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,368
Courage isn't enough.

149
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,425
He won't make it.

150
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,681
He'll be back.

151
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,285
He'll be back.

152
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,920
Yes, Mrs. Storm, Nath's sleeping here
tonight, so don't you worry about it.

153
00:15:48,272 --> 00:15:51,619
Hard work and a big
supper never hurt any boy.

154
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,948
Oh, don't you mention it,
we're glad to have him.

155
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,640
Good night.

156
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,185
How did you know he was back?

157
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,980
Nath's all right.

158
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,204
He's going to be a
great help on the farm.

159
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,931
How did you happen
to get in here?

160
00:16:46,057 --> 00:16:47,827
I ran here.

161
00:16:48,028 --> 00:16:51,194
You scared the daylights
out of me last night.

162
00:16:51,995 --> 00:16:55,716
Seems like the truth shouldn't
scare anybody. Man or boy.

163
00:16:55,717 --> 00:16:57,298
The truth?

164
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:00,944
- You and your screams in the night almost...
- What are you talking about?

165
00:17:02,245 --> 00:17:04,925
Now, don't tell me I
imagined all that stuff?

166
00:17:04,926 --> 00:17:06,715
I went in those words
and I heard things.

167
00:17:06,716 --> 00:17:08,919
- What things?
- I don't know.

168
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,066
I don't know whether it was the screams
you were talking about or... just the wind.

169
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,728
You leave well
enough alone, son.

170
00:17:18,195 --> 00:17:19,859
Go in and wash up.

171
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,762
Join us for breakfast, and you can
catch the school bus with Meg.

172
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,523
What kind of a guy
is Pete anyway?

173
00:17:40,117 --> 00:17:42,199
He's always been
wonderful to me.

174
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,343
And kind and generous.

175
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,085
For my last birthday, he sent to the city

176
00:17:46,086 --> 00:17:50,415
and bought me the most wonderful
furniture he could buy for my room.

177
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,003
He's always been that way.

178
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,589
But... what about
that red house?

179
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,649
I remember hearing him talk
about it a long time ago.

180
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,707
But I've never heard
him mention it since.

181
00:18:07,108 --> 00:18:09,408
- You haven't?
- No.

182
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,839
He's just warned me to stay out
of those woods, since I was little.

183
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,788
Do you know anything
about those screams?

184
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,869
I don't know, Nath.
I may be afraid to find out.

185
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,507
Hey, look whose
moved in with the Morgans.

186
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,600
OK, so I'm working there,
so make something out of it.

187
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,800
Well,

188
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:03,172
you've got nerve,
Nath Storm.

189
00:19:03,173 --> 00:19:06,079
Where were you last night when
I phoned like I said I would?

190
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,630
- Working.
- Working?

191
00:19:08,631 --> 00:19:10,158
All night long?

192
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,729
Ah, Tibby, can't a guy even
earn chore money at the Morgans...

193
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:16,277
..without you throwing a fit?
- Not if it takes all night.

194
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,637
Hi, mom.

195
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:56,945
I see you're not bowled over
by the rush of business.

196
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,569
Oh, things have been
like this all day again.

197
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,721
I suppose folks get tired coming
and asking for things I haven't got.

198
00:20:04,555 --> 00:20:05,881
Look, mom.

199
00:20:05,882 --> 00:20:08,369
Why don't you close the
store and marry Don Brant.

200
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,340
He's a nice guy.

201
00:20:10,386 --> 00:20:14,709
Now there's time enough for Don and me to get
married after you're out of school and on your own.

202
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:17,341
Graduation's just
around the corner.

203
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:23,411
Why don't you two go and get married while
you're still young enough to enjoy it?

204
00:20:23,474 --> 00:20:27,142
Shame on you, talking
to your mother that way.

205
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,849
Well, you've given
enough your life to me.

206
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:33,650
You go down to town and tell
Don you're ready anytime he is.

207
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,879
He's being transferred north.

208
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,611
Well, that settles it.

209
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,802
Here he's been courting you
since I was in grammar school.

210
00:20:41,803 --> 00:20:44,946
If you don't marry him now,
he'll meet some chick up north,

211
00:20:44,947 --> 00:20:48,449
and then you'll be a dead duck.

212
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,735
Well, I've got to change.
I'll be late at the Morgans.

213
00:20:52,371 --> 00:20:55,338
- How do you like it up there?
- Oh, it's OK.

214
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:58,048
<i>They eat good.
I mean, well.</i>

215
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:00,453
<i>A couple of things
got me wondering.</i>

216
00:21:00,454 --> 00:21:02,839
How did Pete Morgan
lose his leg?

217
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,047
He fell down a cliff
in the Ox Head Woods.

218
00:21:05,048 --> 00:21:07,929
It was a long time ago,
you were still a baby.

219
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,615
It was Dr. Burns first
case in the valley.

220
00:21:10,856 --> 00:21:14,163
He amputated the leg on
the Morgan kitchen table.

221
00:21:14,164 --> 00:21:16,751
I wonder if it's
the one I ate at.

222
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:20,718
That was the first time Dr.
Burn ever met Ellen Morgan.

223
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:24,183
Everybody knew he fell in love with her,
but nothing ever came of it.

224
00:21:24,184 --> 00:21:28,065
- I wonder why. He's still a bachelor.
- I don't know.

225
00:21:28,066 --> 00:21:31,828
They still act like they love each other,
the few times I've seen them meet.

226
00:21:31,829 --> 00:21:36,129
But she chose to devote her life
to her brother Pete, I guess.

227
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,816
Seems a shame.

228
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:41,636
Just like it would be a shame if you
don't marry Don and go north with him.

229
00:21:41,637 --> 00:21:45,237
If I do, how long will it be before
you and Tibby get married?

230
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:46,978
Oh, search me.

231
00:21:46,979 --> 00:21:50,749
Sometimes the more I know about women,
the less I know about women.

232
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:54,859
Guy needs more than a high school education
just to find out what they're going to do next.

233
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,445
Will you be staying at
the Morgans again tonight?

234
00:21:57,446 --> 00:21:58,669
No.

235
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,274
I'm going to take a shortcut through
Ox Head Woods by daylight,

236
00:22:01,275 --> 00:22:03,204
so I'll know my way
back here tonight.

237
00:22:03,248 --> 00:22:05,191
Well, if you should
change your mind,

238
00:22:05,192 --> 00:22:09,692
would you care if I go down to town,
and talk things over Don?

239
00:22:09,693 --> 00:22:11,980
You do more than
talk things over.

240
00:22:11,981 --> 00:22:14,309
You come back here a bride.

241
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:18,110
We don't want any dead ducks
in the family, do we?

242
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,037
How are the hens doing?

243
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:51,214
We always have more
eggs than we can use.

244
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,090
Meg?

245
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:06,010
I guess Nath asked a lot of questions
on the way to school this morning.

246
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:09,291
Yes, but only questions
I've wondered about myself.

247
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:11,802
Things you've never explained.

248
00:24:11,803 --> 00:24:13,889
Can't you tell me, Pete?

249
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:17,390
Well, I didn't know that
anything covered you.

250
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:21,118
Why are you suddenly
questioning things?

251
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:23,209
Because of him?

252
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,292
Maybe.

253
00:24:27,268 --> 00:24:29,678
Well, maybe he won't come back.

254
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,469
I think he will.

255
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,357
I hope he does.

256
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,818
All of a sudden you
seem so grown up.

257
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,812
And I guess I don't
like to see it happen.

258
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,781
I wish you were a child again.

259
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:56,074
I wish you needed me
just as you did then.

260
00:24:58,601 --> 00:25:02,069
I don't want you ever
to grow away from us.

261
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:05,035
You mean everything
to Ellen and me.

262
00:25:05,466 --> 00:25:07,909
I want you to be happy.

263
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,135
I love you both very much.

264
00:25:36,342 --> 00:25:38,089
You're late today.

265
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,108
I had to go home first.

266
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:42,489
I came here through
Ox Head Woods.

267
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:46,314
Yes, that would be
the quickest. Day times.

268
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,740
Or any other time.

269
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:54,736
Don't put so high a price
on courage, son. It's overrated.

270
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:58,681
The lowest animals got
more courage than man has.

271
00:25:58,704 --> 00:26:02,832
You touch a snapping turtle with a
stick and he grabs at it with his teeth.

272
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:04,333
Cut his head off,

273
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:08,334
and he...
he still won't let go.

274
00:26:08,335 --> 00:26:11,935
Now, we humans
weren't made that way.

275
00:26:12,236 --> 00:26:14,026
We were born helpless.

276
00:26:14,027 --> 00:26:18,375
But we don't have to stay that way.
Nobody's gonna call me yellow.

277
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:19,985
Who has?

278
00:26:19,986 --> 00:26:22,029
Nobody, yet.

279
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,931
And nobody's going to.

280
00:28:22,184 --> 00:28:25,768
- Has he been outside tonight?
- No.

281
00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:27,733
Give me your word.

282
00:28:27,734 --> 00:28:29,140
Of course.

283
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:33,189
Why, you're soaked through, Nath.
Get a blanket from the chest, Meg.

284
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:35,792
You can stay in
the helper's cabin.

285
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:38,428
I warned you.

286
00:28:38,429 --> 00:28:40,279
But you wouldn't listen.

287
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,801
It wasn't a piece of that red house
that knocked me into the stream, Mr. Morgan.

288
00:28:43,802 --> 00:28:46,069
And it wasn't a scream in the
night that bowled me over.

289
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,738
It was a human, a human strong
enough to nearly killed me.

290
00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:51,761
I figured it was you.

291
00:28:53,963 --> 00:28:58,363
Sometimes we figure too
much, son, the wrong things.

292
00:28:58,364 --> 00:29:01,229
Things that can't
ever be figured.

293
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,134
And it's bad, bad for everyone.

294
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,258
It's quicksand.

295
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:09,649
I need your help here, Nath.

296
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:12,040
Why would I want to hurt you?

297
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:33,350
What do you think
happened, Pete?

298
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,586
There's a curse on those woods.

299
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,847
We know that.

300
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,137
Are you going to
stay with us, Nath?

301
00:30:05,392 --> 00:30:08,879
- Why shouldn't I?
- Well, after what's happened, I thought...

302
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,689
and Tibby doesn't
want you to, does she?

303
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:18,473
After what's happened, you couldn't get me
out of here with a triple barreled shotgun.

304
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,157
Last night I was a coward.

305
00:30:23,007 --> 00:30:26,869
There's some connection between
Pete's red house and whoever hit me.

306
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:29,251
I'm going to find out what goes on
out there if it takes exploring

307
00:30:29,252 --> 00:30:31,359
every Sunday between now and doomsday.

308
00:30:31,382 --> 00:30:33,389
I'll help you.

309
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:36,213
I thought Pete told you
not to go in those woods.

310
00:30:36,214 --> 00:30:38,358
I can't help it, I want to.

311
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,155
OK.

312
00:30:40,156 --> 00:30:42,457
Sunday we'll go prowling.

313
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,681
What about your
date with Tibby?

314
00:30:55,682 --> 00:30:58,108
I want her to be
sure that...

315
00:30:58,109 --> 00:31:01,609
that I don't want you to stay
here just because...

316
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:06,392
I mean, I don't want her to think
I'm trying to steal you away from her.

317
00:31:06,393 --> 00:31:08,841
We did have a date to go
swimming Sunday anyway.

318
00:31:08,842 --> 00:31:12,553
So maybe asking her to come along would
keep her from throwing another fit.

319
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:17,431
- Goodnight, Nath, and thanks.
- Goodnight, Meg.

320
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,332
Help me down, honey.

321
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:50,552
- Don't drop me.
- Drop you? Who's got hold of who?

322
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,819
Hey, kids.

323
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:05,355
I found an old trail,
maybe it leads somewhere.

324
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:08,537
- Another dead end.
- They're all dead ends, I'm hot.

325
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:35,032
We've been on a wild goose
chase for four solid hours.

326
00:33:35,033 --> 00:33:37,864
Find your haunted
house on your own time.

327
00:33:37,865 --> 00:33:39,869
You're on my time now.

328
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:43,501
Or have you forgotten we had a
date to go swimming this afternoon?

329
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,631
Just the two of us...

330
00:33:45,632 --> 00:33:47,632
remember?

331
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:53,455
Let's go back to the farm, kids.
The sun'll be just right for swimming.

332
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,934
Nath! What's happened to you?

333
00:34:01,935 --> 00:34:04,486
Why, what's the matter?

334
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,392
Well, there's a black and blue
streak across your shoulder.

335
00:34:07,393 --> 00:34:09,854
- How'd you get it?
- Oh, that!

336
00:34:09,855 --> 00:34:13,098
- I.. I don't know.
- Of course you know.

337
00:34:13,982 --> 00:34:16,066
You might let me
in on your secrets.

338
00:34:16,067 --> 00:34:18,031
We haven't any secrets.

339
00:34:18,032 --> 00:34:19,802
We told you about the red house.

340
00:34:19,803 --> 00:34:24,509
Look, Tibby, I, uh, I slipped in the stream
last night and fell on my shoulder.

341
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:27,721
- Come on, I'll race you across the pond.
- Aren't you coming in?

342
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:31,417
You had a swimming date,
just the two of you, remember?

343
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:33,218
I'll sun.

344
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,290
Winner!

345
00:35:24,653 --> 00:35:26,942
- Do you love me?
- Sure.

346
00:35:26,943 --> 00:35:29,589
<i>Just keep me well kissed.</i>

347
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,696
<i>I like to be kissed.</i>

348
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,298
Hey, lovebirds, dinner's ready!

349
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,416
Are you and Nath planning
to be married, Tibby?

350
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,916
Well, I like to keep
him guessing, Mr. Morgan.

351
00:36:03,917 --> 00:36:07,402
She's like an ornery heifer
sometimes, hard to hold down.

352
00:36:08,203 --> 00:36:10,924
We're glad to have
you at our house, Tibby.

353
00:36:10,925 --> 00:36:14,226
We've missed having company,
you must come back often.

354
00:36:14,227 --> 00:36:17,327
Besides, we like
to keep Nath happy.

355
00:36:17,928 --> 00:36:19,812
We had a pleasant day?

356
00:36:19,813 --> 00:36:25,061
Well, we wasted most of it looking for a
haunted house in the Ox Head Woods.

357
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:32,051
I didn't know there was a haunted
house in the Ox Head Woods.

358
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:38,551
Well, Nath says it's red and he's
got to find it. Isn't that silly?

359
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,417
Yes, it is.

360
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,237
Meg go with you?

361
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:59,971
Seems there's enough trouble in this world
without having to go out and look for it.

362
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:04,801
Well, I'm all the trouble he
can handle if he only knew it.

363
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:18,260
Well, that's a well one you are
keeping a secret, blabbing to Pete.

364
00:37:18,261 --> 00:37:20,264
I didn't blab, it just slipped out.

365
00:37:20,265 --> 00:37:23,831
And a fine swimming date
we had, I don't think.

366
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,020
You know, Tibby,

367
00:37:26,021 --> 00:37:29,348
you're might pretty,
especially when you're mad.

368
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,337
And I guess maybe,
maybe when you're mad,

369
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,153
you're just about the
prettiest gal there is.

370
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:41,051
Are you sure you don't want me to get
Pete's pickup truck and drive you home?

371
00:37:41,052 --> 00:37:43,302
Can't have your
cake and eat it too.

372
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,912
You have chores to do.

373
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:49,114
I'll walk home, thanks.

374
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:53,198
Don't suppose I'll be seeing
much of you weeknights.

375
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:56,430
Well, what with final exams
coming up and this new job...

376
00:37:56,431 --> 00:37:58,120
I know.

377
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,433
Would it be too much to ask that
we spend next Sunday by ourselves?

378
00:38:02,434 --> 00:38:03,981
Just you and me?

379
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:07,249
Or is it more important to play
hide and seek in the woods with Meg?

380
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,334
Go on, get madder.

381
00:38:09,335 --> 00:38:11,421
It makes your cheeks pink.

382
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:17,621
Don't think you're going to
talk me into a kiss goodbye.

383
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,059
I want you to miss 'em,

384
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:24,060
long enough to make them more
important than... haunted houses.

385
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,217
So save it for next Sunday.

386
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:45,252
I thought you
were napping, Pete.

387
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,372
You disobeyed me.

388
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:57,694
Now you listen to me.

389
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,518
I'm listening.

390
00:38:59,897 --> 00:39:01,308
You went into the
woods with Nath.

391
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:04,709
- Well, why shouldn't I, there only...
- Because I've asked you not to.

392
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:08,816
We didn't find anything, all we did was keep
getting into one dead end after another.

393
00:39:08,817 --> 00:39:11,661
I don't care,
now you listen to me.

394
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,932
All I have in the world is you.

395
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:18,835
If there's anything you want, I'll get it for you,
But there's one thing you've got to do for me.

396
00:39:18,836 --> 00:39:21,081
You stay out of those woods!

397
00:39:21,082 --> 00:39:23,624
I've grown up, and I've got
a right to do as I please.

398
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:26,749
I've never laid hands on you in my life.

399
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,171
But I'll take the
whip to you if you do!

400
00:39:29,172 --> 00:39:30,872
Pete!

401
00:40:03,843 --> 00:40:05,432
Hi, Teller.

402
00:40:05,433 --> 00:40:07,861
- Headed for home?
- Uh-huh.

403
00:40:07,862 --> 00:40:12,429
- That's what I figured. You been swimming?
- How'd you know?

404
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:15,381
Got your suit in
that bag, haven't you?

405
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,309
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.

406
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:21,116
What for?

407
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,657
I want you to do me a favor.

408
00:40:25,658 --> 00:40:28,529
You've got looks and
all the rest besides.

409
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,419
Besides that, I figure
you're the kind that's got

410
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,891
more sense in your head
than comes out of your mouth.

411
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:36,440
Maybe I have.

412
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:39,430
What kind of favor
you want out of me?

413
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:42,701
I've got 750 bucks.

414
00:40:44,626 --> 00:40:46,549
I want you to buy me
a government bond.

415
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:50,492
$750, where'd you get it,
you steal it?

416
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:54,209
I want you to buy me that bond.

417
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:57,855
Have them write my name on it and
buy it the next time you go to town.

418
00:40:58,924 --> 00:41:00,449
There's an extra $10
for your trouble.

419
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:03,272
- Oh I couldn't take money...
- Sure, you could.

420
00:41:03,716 --> 00:41:06,859
And keep your
mouth shut to boot.

421
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,306
I'll be waiting every
Sunday till you bring it.

422
00:41:09,307 --> 00:41:11,789
Why don't you buy it yourself.

423
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:15,491
'Cause the guy in the village
bank's got too long a nose.

424
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:21,011
And because it'll be a prettier
bond if you buy it for me.

425
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,617
I better get home.

426
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,239
Do you want me to help
you cross the stream?

427
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:01,141
Thanks a lot, Teller.

428
00:42:01,262 --> 00:42:03,629
Is that all the thanks I get?

429
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,431
How much more do you want?

430
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:58,091
Teller.

431
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,590
You'll either protect these woods
of mine or I get someone who can.

432
00:43:01,591 --> 00:43:04,335
Oh, why don't you keep
your trespassers at home?

433
00:43:04,336 --> 00:43:06,884
You gave me full rights to
the Ox Head Woods exclusive.

434
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:09,589
I gave you the game rights in exchange
for keeping trespassers out.

435
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:13,391
Look, Mr. Morgan, if you can't keep
your own hired hand out of these woods,

436
00:43:13,492 --> 00:43:16,813
maybe I should use more than a
club to scare him away with.

437
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:19,394
Oh, why don't you?

438
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:23,837
- You telling me I can use my gun?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt but...

439
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:29,639
there's no better way of backing up a No Trespassing
sign than by a bullet missing somebody's skull.

440
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:38,225
OK, Mr. Morgan,
I'll take care of my end.

441
00:43:38,626 --> 00:43:42,034
- This is going to be fun.
- And it's going to be more than that.

442
00:43:42,035 --> 00:43:44,382
It's your last chance.

443
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,114
"Be kind one to another,

444
00:44:02,115 --> 00:44:04,881
tenderhearted, forgiving one another,

445
00:44:04,882 --> 00:44:09,082
even as God, for Christ's sake,
has forgiven you."

446
00:44:11,207 --> 00:44:15,129
Dear Heavenly Father,
we pray to thee

447
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:18,476
to bless all those on earth
who are suffering

448
00:44:18,477 --> 00:44:21,021
in heart and mind,

449
00:44:21,022 --> 00:44:23,222
body and spirit.

450
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:31,050
Grant them the blessing of
hope and faith and strength...

451
00:44:32,751 --> 00:44:34,451
and peace.

452
00:44:38,302 --> 00:44:40,002
Amen.

453
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,392
What's troubling you, Pete?

454
00:44:49,393 --> 00:44:52,182
You haven't eaten,
you haven't slept.

455
00:45:11,495 --> 00:45:13,143
Hello?

456
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,609
Yes Tibby, I'll call him.

457
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:17,280
Tibby wants you.

458
00:45:18,655 --> 00:45:20,719
Hello, Tibby.

459
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,449
No, I'm coming over.

460
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:25,679
Or you can use the
pickup truck, Nath.

461
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:28,174
Pete says I can use
his pickup truck.

462
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:29,894
I'll come on down.

463
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:31,617
Bye.

464
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:35,157
You know, when I was
a young man and in love,

465
00:45:35,158 --> 00:45:38,358
Sunday was always
a good day for spooning.

466
00:45:38,386 --> 00:45:41,069
Thanks for the
use of the truck.

467
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:44,652
Always ready to give love
a helping hand,

468
00:45:44,653 --> 00:45:46,653
aren't we, Meg?

469
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:50,177
That's right.

470
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:55,734
Now, I might add, it's a lot
healthier than prowling in woods.

471
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:13,276
I don't care what Pete said, I wish
we were prowling in the woods today.

472
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,529
I wish Tibby'd
forgotten our date.

473
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:17,454
So do I.

474
00:46:18,549 --> 00:46:21,229
There's something
out in those woods.

475
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:25,875
Something tells me we won't find out
what it is until I find the red house.

476
00:46:27,355 --> 00:46:30,677
What are we going to do
with it when we find it?

477
00:46:30,678 --> 00:46:33,729
Bust it open, I guess,
and let some light in.

478
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:37,337
Maybe it'll shake the creeps
out of a lot of things.

479
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:39,817
We'll find it.

480
00:47:05,818 --> 00:47:07,518
I, uh...

481
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:11,521
I got this for your graduation.

482
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:14,869
I wasn't going to give
it to you until then, but...

483
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:17,570
because it's a gray day and...

484
00:47:17,871 --> 00:47:20,271
because I want you to be happy...

485
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,370
I, uh...

486
00:47:23,171 --> 00:47:25,371
go ahead, open it.

487
00:47:35,544 --> 00:47:38,009
Oh, how beautiful!

488
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:41,559
- You like it?
- Oh, I love it.

489
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:44,779
Oh, uh, let me put it on, huh?

490
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:59,251
Now will you forgive me for
barking at you last Sunday?

491
00:48:00,983 --> 00:48:03,807
I didn't exactly disobey, Pete.

492
00:48:03,808 --> 00:48:06,229
I've always wanted to
go into those woods.

493
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:09,361
I did it because
I felt I had to.

494
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,070
Strange.

495
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:16,392
I felt I belonged there.

496
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:19,314
Don't ever go near
those woods again.

497
00:48:31,565 --> 00:48:33,369
Thanks for the watch.

498
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:34,996
I'll treasure it all my life.

499
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,570
Tibby, you've
got Meg all wrong.

500
00:53:41,571 --> 00:53:44,292
Didn't she ask you up to
spend the day and have dinner?

501
00:53:44,391 --> 00:53:45,845
Yeah, but why?

502
00:53:45,846 --> 00:53:48,807
Can't anybody do anything without
you figuring they've got an angle?

503
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:51,850
I've always got an angle.
I've got an angle on you!

504
00:53:51,851 --> 00:53:54,122
A girl always has a reason
when she does something.

505
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,041
- Does she?
- Sure.

506
00:53:56,042 --> 00:53:57,389
OK.

507
00:53:57,390 --> 00:54:00,475
And what's your reason for
dawdling with that guy Teller?

508
00:54:00,476 --> 00:54:03,401
- What do you mean dawdling?
- Just what I said.

509
00:54:03,402 --> 00:54:05,245
You think I didn't see you?

510
00:54:05,246 --> 00:54:07,646
How could you?
Where were you?

511
00:54:07,647 --> 00:54:09,297
In the bus.

512
00:54:09,298 --> 00:54:10,806
Where'd you think I was?

513
00:54:10,807 --> 00:54:12,908
Oh, that.

514
00:54:12,909 --> 00:54:14,390
Yes, that.

515
00:54:14,391 --> 00:54:16,673
Was there some more dawdling
I didn't know about?

516
00:54:16,674 --> 00:54:20,261
You don't think I'd be interested in a
big dumb ox who makes his living hunting?

517
00:54:20,262 --> 00:54:23,252
Well, you were interested enough
to stop and talk to him that afternoon.

518
00:54:23,253 --> 00:54:26,398
Well, he was sitting on our rocks.
I told him to get off them.

519
00:54:26,399 --> 00:54:27,903
What did he say?

520
00:54:27,904 --> 00:54:29,530
He said he would.

521
00:54:29,531 --> 00:54:32,556
- I'll bet.
- You calling me a liar?

522
00:54:32,651 --> 00:54:36,250
Now don't make something out of nothing.
All I said was, I'll bet.

523
00:54:36,251 --> 00:54:38,650
- You bet what?
- I'll bet...

524
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:41,851
he said he'd get off your rocks.

525
00:54:42,931 --> 00:54:45,312
Is that calling you a liar?

526
00:54:48,371 --> 00:54:50,196
Pop was right.

527
00:54:50,197 --> 00:54:51,823
Right about what?

528
00:54:51,824 --> 00:54:56,288
You're too bright to be wasting your time
up at the Morgans' for four bits an hour.

529
00:54:56,289 --> 00:54:58,637
Well, they just
live off their farm.

530
00:54:58,638 --> 00:55:01,344
We make a profit on ours.

531
00:55:01,345 --> 00:55:04,708
Since when is there a law
against living off the earth?

532
00:55:04,709 --> 00:55:07,589
We're going to live
off the earth some day.

533
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:11,076
Before we're finished, we're gonna
leave our kids a good farm.

534
00:55:11,477 --> 00:55:15,402
I want to clear out of these
hills when I get married.

535
00:55:15,703 --> 00:55:17,850
- Since when?
- Since now.

536
00:55:17,851 --> 00:55:20,630
I don't want to be
just any farm wife.

537
00:55:20,631 --> 00:55:23,993
This is a good a time as
any other to find that out.

538
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:32,350
Well, if you love someone,
you'll do anything for 'em.

539
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:34,753
That works both ways.

540
00:55:35,091 --> 00:55:38,173
Maybe someday you'll
own this whole valley,

541
00:55:38,174 --> 00:55:40,980
and we can spend our
winters in the city house.

542
00:55:41,009 --> 00:55:42,490
Sure.

543
00:55:42,491 --> 00:55:45,680
With two station
wagons and a limousine.

544
00:55:46,951 --> 00:55:48,761
Why not?

545
00:55:49,917 --> 00:55:53,538
- I better get back to the Morgans'.
- What for?

546
00:55:53,539 --> 00:55:56,850
Let you go on with your dreaming.
I'm disturbing your sleep.

547
00:55:56,851 --> 00:56:01,275
City house, station wagons,
limousines. Great.

548
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:05,278
Boy, when you dream,
you really dream good.

549
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:11,002
Well, aren't I
worth working for?

550
00:56:11,003 --> 00:56:12,572
Sure.

551
00:56:12,573 --> 00:56:15,601
And a lot of guys are working
on getting to the moon in a rocket.

552
00:56:15,602 --> 00:56:17,704
They think that's
worth working for.

553
00:56:17,705 --> 00:56:19,748
But I like the
ground around here.

554
00:56:19,749 --> 00:56:22,236
And I just as soon
keep my feet on it.

555
00:56:22,237 --> 00:56:25,347
How much money have
you saved doing it?

556
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:27,350
None yet.

557
00:56:27,351 --> 00:56:30,338
Not even $750?

558
00:56:30,431 --> 00:56:33,294
Not even 750 cents.

559
00:56:33,295 --> 00:56:34,930
Why?

560
00:56:34,931 --> 00:56:37,653
Nothing, I was just thinking.

561
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:52,020
Nath, didn't Meg go with you?
I thought she did.

562
00:56:52,021 --> 00:56:53,661
She was gone when you left.

563
00:56:53,662 --> 00:56:56,523
- Didn't she leave with you this noon?
- No, only as far as the porch.

564
00:56:56,524 --> 00:56:58,510
Did she say she was going anywhere?

565
00:56:58,511 --> 00:57:01,136
She must have gone
into the woods alone.

566
00:57:06,237 --> 00:57:07,937
Meg!

567
00:57:11,131 --> 00:57:12,841
Meg!

568
00:57:13,542 --> 00:57:15,142
Nath!

569
00:57:28,731 --> 00:57:30,499
I knew you'd come.

570
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,325
Are you hurt?

571
00:57:32,711 --> 00:57:35,118
Yes, I think maybe
my leg's broken.

572
00:57:37,431 --> 00:57:39,640
Here, hold this.

573
00:57:39,931 --> 00:57:43,755
Now, put all your
weight on the other leg.

574
00:57:59,003 --> 00:58:02,610
We were happy here
till that boy came.

575
00:58:02,611 --> 00:58:05,111
Meg loved me,
trusted me,

576
00:58:05,112 --> 00:58:07,412
did everything I asked.

577
00:58:07,711 --> 00:58:09,692
Then he came.

578
00:58:12,191 --> 00:58:14,161
I'm losing her.

579
00:58:19,011 --> 00:58:22,982
I've fought fate 15
years ago, and I lost.

580
00:58:27,071 --> 00:58:29,057
You know that, Ellen.

581
00:58:31,931 --> 00:58:36,641
- I tried to stay away from that house.
- Yes, Pete, you tried.

582
00:58:36,731 --> 00:58:39,159
She kept calling.

583
00:58:39,251 --> 00:58:41,639
I had to go to her.

584
00:58:42,674 --> 00:58:44,676
Don't dig it up again, dear.

585
00:58:44,677 --> 00:58:47,444
Let's bury it, it's past.

586
00:58:47,445 --> 00:58:49,390
Buried until that
boy came here.

587
00:58:49,391 --> 00:58:53,919
Nath doesn't know anything about it,
Pete, that's all in your mind.

588
00:58:54,144 --> 00:58:58,108
Do you think there's a man on earth
who hasn't something to conceal?

589
00:58:58,109 --> 00:59:00,750
Every living soul has
his Ox Head Woods.

590
00:59:00,751 --> 00:59:03,495
I can still see her.

591
00:59:03,542 --> 00:59:05,990
She knew there was nothing
I could do about it.

592
00:59:05,991 --> 00:59:08,961
- He knew it.
- Don't dig it up again, dear, please. Forget...

593
00:59:09,051 --> 00:59:12,380
- Why didn't Nath go before it happened?
- Please.

594
00:59:12,381 --> 00:59:14,956
Why did she scream?

595
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:17,695
I loved her, she knew it.

596
00:59:18,451 --> 00:59:22,272
- Why did she cry out?
- Shh.

597
00:59:22,405 --> 00:59:24,253
It's been 15 years, dear.

598
00:59:24,254 --> 00:59:25,944
Put it out of your mind.

599
00:59:25,945 --> 00:59:28,607
Don't let it drive
you mad again.

600
00:59:28,608 --> 00:59:31,150
It's gone. It's over.

601
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:33,657
It can't touch Meg.

602
00:59:33,681 --> 00:59:37,363
- There's nothing I can do about it.
- There is something we can do about it.

603
00:59:37,364 --> 00:59:39,345
We can protect
her from the past.

604
00:59:39,346 --> 00:59:42,730
How can I protect her from the past
when I can't shut it out myself?

605
00:59:42,731 --> 00:59:47,340
- We can shut it out of this house!
- No, no, this isn't my house.

606
00:59:47,671 --> 00:59:50,597
There's no certain
place for me on earth

607
00:59:50,731 --> 00:59:53,662
except out there
in that icehouse.

608
00:59:53,691 --> 00:59:55,531
That's where I belong.

609
00:59:58,018 --> 01:00:01,980
- What if Meg should find out?
- Pete, Pete, how could she find out?

610
01:00:01,981 --> 01:00:03,771
I didn't want her to go.

611
01:00:03,772 --> 01:00:07,459
<i>I'd rather she was dead than ever hear
the screams. I'd rather she was dead.</i>

612
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:10,784
I'd rather I died out
there in the muck and dirt.

613
01:00:10,785 --> 01:00:12,794
That's where I belong.

614
01:00:12,795 --> 01:00:15,726
- I should have burned that place down.
- No, no.

615
01:00:15,727 --> 01:00:17,895
They'd search the ashes
and find her screaming.

616
01:00:17,896 --> 01:00:20,539
I should've burned it down and
the icehouse and the woods with it.

617
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:23,590
Don't you dare.
Don't never dare.

618
01:00:23,591 --> 01:00:26,336
<i>Ellen, Pete!
Open the door!</i>

619
01:00:26,637 --> 01:00:28,137
<i>Ellen!</i>

620
01:00:34,051 --> 01:00:35,218
What's happened to her?

621
01:00:35,269 --> 01:00:37,930
I found her in your woods.
Her leg's broken.

622
01:00:37,931 --> 01:00:40,659
- Call Dr. Byrne.
- Call Jonathan, Pete.

623
01:01:01,551 --> 01:01:03,251
Dr. Byrne.

624
01:01:04,755 --> 01:01:08,680
Dr. Byrne? This is Pete Morgan,
we need you.

625
01:01:08,681 --> 01:01:10,790
Meg's leg is broken.

626
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:12,633
Come quick.

627
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,100
It's Nath.

628
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,221
<i>Somebody'll hear you.</i>

629
01:01:51,861 --> 01:01:54,262
Oh, I'm so glad you came.

630
01:01:54,263 --> 01:01:58,072
- Why did you wait so long?
- Ellen wouldn't let me come.

631
01:01:58,073 --> 01:02:01,297
I never thought of climbing
that tree until tonight.

632
01:02:01,298 --> 01:02:04,124
I wanted to tell you
about the red house.

633
01:02:04,125 --> 01:02:06,412
I followed some wagon
tracks through the woods.

634
01:02:06,413 --> 01:02:08,349
- They were all grown...
- Where did they start?

635
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:10,039
I don't know.

636
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:14,842
I headed up hill just past the big
limestone rocks we saw that Sunday.

637
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,040
How's Tibby?

638
01:02:18,712 --> 01:02:20,099
Search me.

639
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:24,670
She's gone to town for something,
graduation dress, I think.

640
01:02:24,671 --> 01:02:26,558
Bet you miss her.

641
01:02:31,432 --> 01:02:33,339
Tell me about the red house.

642
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:36,027
After the limestone rocks, what?

643
01:02:36,111 --> 01:02:38,539
Well, I followed these
tracks through the rocks.

644
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:40,463
The road's hard to follow,
but it led to this hill.

645
01:02:40,464 --> 01:02:41,725
What hill?

646
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:45,503
I don't know, I was too busy
following the tracks to see.

647
01:02:45,722 --> 01:02:49,244
I looked down from the
top into the rocks.

648
01:02:49,245 --> 01:02:50,553
And there it was.

649
01:02:50,554 --> 01:02:52,819
What does it look like?

650
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:55,149
Ugly and awful.

651
01:02:55,186 --> 01:02:57,154
But Nath, I had the feeling
I've been there before.

652
01:02:57,155 --> 01:02:59,759
Lots of people get that feeling,
Meg, even if they haven't.

653
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,047
No, this was different.

654
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:07,981
I even seem to remember
the icehouse back against the rocks.

655
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:11,980
Water shimmered out
from under it...

656
01:03:12,042 --> 01:03:13,442
as if it were flooded.

657
01:03:13,443 --> 01:03:16,643
- How do you know it was an icehouse?
- That's what scares me, I know it was.

658
01:03:16,644 --> 01:03:19,924
- But how did I know?
- Well, didn't you go look?

659
01:03:19,925 --> 01:03:22,696
I didn't dare go without you.

660
01:03:22,697 --> 01:03:24,899
My heart started pounding.

661
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,265
Are you sure you
didn't hear screams?

662
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,180
Yes.

663
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:36,431
I think I did.

664
01:03:36,432 --> 01:03:38,940
I think that's why I ran,
I don't know.

665
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,024
You'd better go.

666
01:03:57,220 --> 01:04:00,467
But come back again
tomorrow night.

667
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,160
Your hair tickles.

668
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:39,820
Jeannie...

669
01:04:42,821 --> 01:04:44,221
are you all right?

670
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:47,102
Just turned out my light.

671
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,631
I thought I heard
you calling for me.

672
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:55,625
No. I was just
about to go to sleep.

673
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,380
Good.

674
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,122
Sleep soundly, Jeannie.

675
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:32,661
You were in Meg's
room just now.

676
01:05:32,753 --> 01:05:34,179
Yes, I was.

677
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:36,423
You sneaked up the tree.

678
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:39,639
- You were there with her in the dark.
- Is there a law against me seeing her?

679
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,469
Yes, mine.

680
01:05:41,513 --> 01:05:44,875
There was peace in this house until you came.
You took her into the woods.

681
01:05:44,876 --> 01:05:47,982
- Meg went into the woods on her own.
- She wouldn't have gone if it weren't for you.

682
01:05:47,983 --> 01:05:49,690
Her leg wouldn't have been
broken if it weren't for you.

683
01:05:49,691 --> 01:05:52,259
You've got no right to
treat her like a child.

684
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:54,827
You caused all the
trouble you're going to.

685
01:05:54,828 --> 01:05:56,890
I don't want you here anymore.

686
01:05:56,891 --> 01:05:58,440
Get out, now!

687
01:05:58,456 --> 01:06:00,379
You don't need to
think I want this job.

688
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:03,623
- I could work for Rentons any day I like.
- Clear out.

689
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:06,242
Never trespass on
my property again.

690
01:06:06,243 --> 01:06:08,286
If you do, you'll get hurt.

691
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:11,806
- Is that fair warning?
- Yes, that's clear enough.

692
01:06:28,802 --> 01:06:31,292
You can take one place off.

693
01:06:31,793 --> 01:06:34,104
Nath's quit, he's gone
to work for Tibby's folks.

694
01:06:34,105 --> 01:06:36,126
Without even saying goodbye?

695
01:06:36,127 --> 01:06:38,316
But it seems they
needed him this morning.

696
01:06:38,317 --> 01:06:40,719
He said to say goodbye
to you and Meg.

697
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,631
That's not like Nath.

698
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:45,159
He's a nice boy.

699
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:48,001
What are we going
to do for help?

700
01:06:48,091 --> 01:06:50,339
We can manage alone.

701
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:53,726
Meg will soon be up and around
and we can manage alone.

702
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:56,627
Just you and me and...

703
01:06:57,228 --> 01:06:59,128
Meg.

704
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,407
Did you quarrel with Nath?

705
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:06,986
Don't lie to me, Pete.

706
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,470
Why should I
quarrel with the boy?

707
01:07:10,399 --> 01:07:14,199
For the same reason you
killed Jeannie's husband.

708
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:17,180
Because you wanted
her all to yourself.

709
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:23,550
Ellen!

710
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,440
Ellen!

711
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,320
Meg, dear.

712
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:43,563
Nath's gone.

713
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,802
He sent you his love.

714
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:50,671
He needed a full time job
now that school's about over.

715
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:00,823
I was putting some dishes away and
the wall cupboard came down on my arm.

716
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,587
We'll miss Nath, won't we?

717
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,602
It's going to be lonesome
for you, isn't it?

718
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:31,871
Why don't you padlock this door
and go out to the Morgans'.

719
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,664
I've quit there, Mom.

720
01:08:33,853 --> 01:08:36,259
I'm going to work
for the Rentons.

721
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:39,506
Well, with Tibby around,
then you won't be lonesome.

722
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,240
I'll be OK, Mom.

723
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:50,291
Well, happy honeymoon.

724
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:54,210
Thanks again for everything.

725
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,147
- Goodbye, son.
- Bye.

726
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:07,747
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, Mom.

727
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:30,590
Hello, doctor.

728
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:34,104
How's my patient? I bet it
feels better with that cast off.

729
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:37,919
I've been cheating a little, Dr. Byrne.
I tried walking without my crutches.

730
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,728
Uh-huh.
I brought up the mail.

731
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:46,391
- Where's Ellen?
- Gathering the eggs.

732
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,224
How's everyone in the valley?

733
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:52,064
Oh, new baby at Sheriff Hawk's.

734
01:09:52,365 --> 01:09:54,488
New hired hand at the Rentons'.

735
01:09:54,573 --> 01:09:55,799
Who?

736
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,870
Mrs. Storm's boy, Nath.

737
01:09:58,249 --> 01:09:59,699
Yeah.

738
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:02,344
Everybody's wondering what the
Rentons want most,

739
01:10:02,345 --> 01:10:06,936
the Storm boy for a son-in-law or an
extra hand on the farm for free.

740
01:10:07,013 --> 01:10:09,895
- Is Nath living at the Rentons'?
- No.

741
01:10:09,896 --> 01:10:12,222
I see him going back
to the store nights.

742
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:16,987
Say, wasn't he working here at the time
you broke this pretty leg?

743
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:20,380
Yes, but he had to
get a full-time job.

744
01:10:20,381 --> 01:10:23,391
He's got a full-time
job handling Tibby.

745
01:10:23,392 --> 01:10:25,793
She's a wild one.

746
01:10:25,837 --> 01:10:30,539
Well, I've got a few babies coming,
few old folks dying. I've got to be going.

747
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:33,502
- Hiya, Pete.
- Hello, doctor.

748
01:10:33,503 --> 01:10:37,051
Our Meg's about as good as new.
Young bones knit fast.

749
01:10:37,052 --> 01:10:39,922
Yeah, well, thank heavens
she was luckier than I was.

750
01:10:40,012 --> 01:10:44,179
Yes, but then a girl needs a pretty leg
more than a man does.

751
01:10:44,432 --> 01:10:47,318
With a little help and being careful,
she can forget the crutches.

752
01:10:47,328 --> 01:10:49,911
Well, I'll help her,
I'll take care of her.

753
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:52,556
I'll watch her like
a Saint Bernard.

754
01:10:56,912 --> 01:10:58,412
All right.

755
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,822
Say hello to her for me.

756
01:11:03,841 --> 01:11:05,619
- I will.
- Bye bye.

757
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:07,320
- Bye.
- Bye.

758
01:11:14,411 --> 01:11:17,399
Remember when I had to learn to
walk again,

759
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,721
just like climbing
a mountain all day long.

760
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:23,902
Better lean on me.

761
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:27,347
Mustn't try too
much the first time.

762
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:30,671
I just want to help you.

763
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:33,008
That's what I'm for.

764
01:11:33,009 --> 01:11:35,209
That's what I like.

765
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:48,423
Oh, hi.

766
01:11:50,118 --> 01:11:53,399
- What you got on?
- My new play suit. Do you like it?

767
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,990
It's all right.

768
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:59,069
You might as well still be working at the
Morgans' for all the fun you are to me.

769
01:11:59,450 --> 01:12:01,596
If you'd spend a little more
time working around this place

770
01:12:01,597 --> 01:12:04,286
instead of preening your
feathers like a pet canary,

771
01:12:04,356 --> 01:12:06,826
maybe you'd know what it
is to be tired at night.

772
01:12:06,827 --> 01:12:10,814
I had a nice Sunday picnic all planned
for us tomorrow down by the stream.

773
01:12:10,815 --> 01:12:12,979
But I'm not gonna
waste it on you.

774
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:14,784
You sleep all day
if you want to.

775
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,142
Oh, just till 10:00 or 11:00.

776
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:22,044
You didn't sleep till any 10:00 or 11:00 up at
the Morgans' because you wanted to see her.

777
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:25,299
Go stick your head under a
faucet and cool off, Tibby.

778
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:27,950
If you want to go on that picnic
tomorrow, I'll be here till 11:00.

779
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:14,188
So you finally made
up your mind to come.

780
01:13:20,192 --> 01:13:21,596
Here's your bond.

781
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:23,408
I've been here every Sunday.

782
01:13:23,409 --> 01:13:25,393
Well, I couldn't get
here before today.

783
01:13:25,394 --> 01:13:27,517
Who do you think you
are, standing me up?

784
01:13:27,518 --> 01:13:29,179
You've been drinking.

785
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:30,088
So what?

786
01:13:30,089 --> 01:13:33,739
Well, I'm sorry I came at all.
I'm sorry I got your old bond.

787
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:36,146
- Did you tell anybody?
- You're drunk.

788
01:13:42,337 --> 01:13:43,968
Who are you kidding?

789
01:13:43,969 --> 01:13:47,219
You can fool around with pretty boy
Nath Storm as much as you like.

790
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:49,782
But when you decide on
a man, you come to me.

791
01:13:59,734 --> 01:14:01,579
You had to catch him
when he was drunk.

792
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:05,362
Just try it sometime when he's sober,
just once, he'd kill you.

793
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,986
Can't you see
you're not wanted?

794
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,750
Yeah, I can.

795
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:37,122
The next time you feel like
snooping around Ox Head Woods,

796
01:14:37,123 --> 01:14:40,605
read the signs, the part
about "at your own risk."

797
01:14:40,693 --> 01:14:42,119
Why?

798
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,991
Because some yellow belly'll
sock me in the dark?

799
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:52,383
Because I got full
rights to them woods.

800
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:55,389
- Who gave 'em to you?
- Pete Morgan.

801
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:59,920
Then would you be knowing
how Meg broke her leg?

802
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:02,343
No, I wouldn't.

803
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,627
But if it was you snooping around
these woods, you'd get this.

804
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,901
Come on, Tibby,
let's get out of here.

805
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,683
This is the way it
could always be, Jeannie.

806
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:03,305
We don't need anybody else.

807
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:16,260
Meg.

808
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,548
What's the matter, child?

809
01:16:27,589 --> 01:16:31,179
I don't know.
Just heartsick, I guess.

810
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:33,269
You miss Nath, don't you?

811
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:34,991
Yes.

812
01:16:35,231 --> 01:16:38,979
And something's wrong here.
I don't know what it is.

813
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:41,650
Wrong in what way?

814
01:16:42,154 --> 01:16:45,720
Ellen, who is Jeannie?

815
01:16:45,721 --> 01:16:47,711
Where did you hear that name?

816
01:16:47,712 --> 01:16:51,335
Pete's called me that several times,
and when he does, I'm afraid.

817
01:16:51,336 --> 01:16:53,279
When has he called
you that name?

818
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:56,823
Up in my room when my leg
was hurting, out by the pond.

819
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,084
Has Pete ever
laid hands on you?

820
01:16:59,214 --> 01:17:00,679
No.

821
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:02,122
Why do you ask that?

822
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:08,565
Finish the dishes, dear.

823
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:21,704
- Anything wrong?
- No.

824
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:27,019
You're working too hard, Pete.

825
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:29,611
Why don't we get
Nath back to help?

826
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:32,819
We're better off without him.

827
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:34,882
I'm sure Meg misses him.

828
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:39,965
She's young, she deserves the company
of a nice boy like Nath, a little fun.

829
01:17:41,372 --> 01:17:44,794
That's what you said
about Herb Snell years ago.

830
01:17:44,795 --> 01:17:47,885
Herb Snell was fun, remember?

831
01:17:47,886 --> 01:17:50,293
I didn't have time to
learn how to dance.

832
01:17:50,294 --> 01:17:55,694
I was too busy earning the money that would make
it possible for me to ask Jeannie to be my wife.

833
01:17:55,695 --> 01:17:59,019
And Herb Snell was busy becoming
the best dancer in the valley.

834
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:01,343
Nath's like you were, not Herb.

835
01:18:01,445 --> 01:18:04,767
He's a fine boy,
honest, a hard worker.

836
01:18:04,768 --> 01:18:07,129
He has a girl.
What does he want with Meg?

837
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:09,571
Meg needs to be with
young people like Nath.

838
01:18:09,572 --> 01:18:12,259
You can't condemn
her to loneliness.

839
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:13,621
Meg belongs here with us.

840
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:15,658
Do you want to chain her
to this place all her life?

841
01:18:15,659 --> 01:18:17,866
All my life, yes.

842
01:18:18,067 --> 01:18:19,729
I've given my life to you, Pete,

843
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:22,892
because you're my brother and
I loved you, and you needed me.

844
01:18:22,893 --> 01:18:25,803
You know what it's meant
to me, what I've lost.

845
01:18:25,804 --> 01:18:28,789
You know what Jonathan
Byrne and I might have had.

846
01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:30,376
Well, did I ask you
not to marry him?

847
01:18:30,377 --> 01:18:32,439
No, but you wouldn't let me
take Meg with me if I did.

848
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,151
Did you expect me to?

849
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,428
Whatever happiness I get,
I've got to find while I live.

850
01:18:36,429 --> 01:18:38,816
You can find
happiness by giving it.

851
01:18:38,817 --> 01:18:41,379
Well, do you think I could
find it with that boy back here?

852
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:44,664
Do you think he'd stop prowling in those
woods until he found the red house?

853
01:18:44,702 --> 01:18:47,186
He wouldn't stop at that,
he'd dig deeper.

854
01:18:47,187 --> 01:18:51,378
He'd dig up a skull and
bring in home as a trophy.

855
01:18:51,379 --> 01:18:53,602
What do you think
that would do to Meg?

856
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:56,685
What do you think would happen
to her if she found out the truth?

857
01:18:56,686 --> 01:19:00,370
- She'd loathe me all the rest of her life.
- But you've got to be fair to Meg.

858
01:19:00,371 --> 01:19:02,719
All right, so I'm not fair.

859
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:04,941
But I can't let her go.

860
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:07,408
As long as the red house
stands in that quarry,

861
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:10,450
my whole life is Meg's
and her life is mine.

862
01:19:28,345 --> 01:19:29,810
What are you
going to do, Ellen?

863
01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:32,657
I'm going to burn that
place out of Pete's mind.

864
01:19:32,658 --> 01:19:36,008
I don't care if it starts a forest fire.
It's going up in flames tonight.

865
01:19:36,009 --> 01:19:38,235
- You can't go into those woods.
- I know them well enough.

866
01:19:38,236 --> 01:19:41,976
It isn't that, I didn't tell you or Nath the
whole truth about how my leg was broken.

867
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:44,479
I fell, but it was because
somebody was shooting at me.

868
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:47,805
- I was afraid Nath would get shot, afraid...
- Teller.

869
01:19:47,806 --> 01:19:50,851
It's Pete's fault for letting Teller
think he owns those woods.

870
01:19:50,852 --> 01:19:53,553
He's just trying to scare
you, but he's afraid of me.

871
01:19:53,554 --> 01:19:55,637
- Let me go with you.
- No, your leg isn't strong enough.

872
01:19:55,638 --> 01:19:57,619
I don't want to
stay here alone.

873
01:19:57,620 --> 01:20:00,484
Come with me as far as
Nath's cabin. Lock yourself in.

874
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:03,310
I'll be back before
Pete knows I'm gone.

875
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:05,428
Ellen?

876
01:20:05,729 --> 01:20:07,329
Meg?

877
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:13,070
Ellen! Meg?

878
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:17,925
Ellen! Meg!

879
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,207
Wait here for me.

880
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:33,900
Meg!

881
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:13,680
Ellen!

882
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,825
All right, Nath, come up out of there.
I got you covered.

883
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:33,469
Miss Ellen.
Miss Ellen!

884
01:21:35,173 --> 01:21:36,919
I didn't aim to kill.

885
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:39,029
Miss Ellen, please.

886
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:40,830
<i>Ellen!</i>

887
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:23,107
<i>Pete! Pete!</i>

888
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,887
Pete, where are you?

889
01:22:28,688 --> 01:22:30,288
Pete!

890
01:22:32,572 --> 01:22:36,259
Didn't you hear me?
Ellen's hurt, she needs help.

891
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:38,660
Yes, I know.

892
01:22:40,004 --> 01:22:42,604
She's bleeding,
she's been shot.

893
01:22:42,752 --> 01:22:45,019
Ellen's lost now.

894
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:46,907
Lost.

895
01:22:47,894 --> 01:22:49,717
Nothing will help.

896
01:22:49,718 --> 01:22:52,259
Pete, you're not gonna
sit here and let her die.

897
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:54,391
She was going to the red house.

898
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:00,590
15 years those woods
have been calling to me.

899
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:02,730
<i>Storm's store.</i>

900
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:04,506
It won't get me.

901
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:07,106
Nath, it's Meg.

902
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,660
I need help.

903
01:23:08,661 --> 01:23:11,267
He can't help.
Nobody can help.

904
01:23:11,268 --> 01:23:13,869
Ellen's in the woods, hurt.
<i>Teller shot her.</i>

905
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:16,734
<i>- I can't carry her out alone.</i>
- Where is she?

906
01:23:16,735 --> 01:23:20,146
On the trail we took just before
we reached the limestone rocks.

907
01:23:20,149 --> 01:23:21,939
I'll call Dr. Byrne
and the sheriff.

908
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:24,340
- I'll bring a stretcher.
- Hurry!

909
01:23:26,477 --> 01:23:28,608
You're not going back in there,
you can't do it.

910
01:23:28,609 --> 01:23:31,115
You'll be lost too, believe me,
I know the woods are evil.

911
01:23:31,116 --> 01:23:33,119
I know what's there,
I know the dangers.

912
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:36,585
- Oh, darling, don't.
- Let go of me.

913
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,042
You don't know.

914
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,482
Darling, I've
stopped the bleeding.

915
01:23:51,483 --> 01:23:54,025
You'll be fine now.

916
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:58,585
You'll get everything
you need soon.

917
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:00,286
Nath's coming.

918
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:02,802
And he's called Jonathan.

919
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:06,787
Jonathan.

920
01:24:07,088 --> 01:24:09,088
Need him.

921
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:12,970
Does it hurt as much now?

922
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:21,322
Doesn't hurt now.

923
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:24,388
Be fine.

924
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:30,884
Pete!

925
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:33,467
Pity Pete.

926
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:37,304
Pity him.

927
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:40,342
Love him.

928
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:58,480
- How is she?
- She's asleep, I bandaged her.

929
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:00,266
Oh, Nath, thanks.

930
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:03,101
I made a stretcher out of a blanket
and a couple of rake handles.

931
01:25:03,102 --> 01:25:05,512
- It's all I had.
- Did you get Dr. Byrne?

932
01:25:05,513 --> 01:25:09,175
He wasn't in. I left a message.
I called the sheriff.

933
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:12,850
She's sleeping awfully sound.

934
01:25:19,151 --> 01:25:20,851
She's dead.

935
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:14,984
What you got on your mind, me?

936
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:24,730
I couldn't get you
out of my mind, baby.

937
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:30,030
That's the way you
are with me too.

938
01:26:30,167 --> 01:26:31,798
Let's do something about it.

939
01:26:31,799 --> 01:26:34,564
Let's borrow your
father's truck and elope.

940
01:26:34,565 --> 01:26:36,227
Elope?

941
01:26:36,228 --> 01:26:38,228
Holy smoke.
Pop would kill us.

942
01:26:38,229 --> 01:26:39,819
Come on, baby.

943
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:43,345
We'll drive across the state line.
I'll cash in my bond.

944
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:48,471
We'll splurge it having a honeymoon
that'll top any honeymoon anybody ever had.

945
01:26:49,711 --> 01:26:54,163
The truck's in the orchard shed, we can
head out the back road, they won't hear us.

946
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,244
She hurt bad?

947
01:27:08,245 --> 01:27:10,245
She's dead.

948
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:32,550
You think I didn't love Ellen.

949
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:37,380
Every day for years
she's died for me.

950
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:41,466
You think I can forget that?

951
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:46,123
But she forgot the woods.

952
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:49,191
<i>That's what's killed her.</i>

953
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:51,982
<i>You hate me now, don't you?</i>

954
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:54,588
<i>Yes, I think I do.</i>

955
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:58,526
You let Ellen die.

956
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:01,360
No, no.

957
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:05,069
You defy the woods,
and you will hurt.

958
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:07,561
She defied them,

959
01:28:08,162 --> 01:28:10,562
and she's dead.

960
01:28:13,649 --> 01:28:15,419
Ellen didn't hate me.

961
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:17,728
She always understood.

962
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:23,840
You'll leave me now, I
suppose, won't you, Meg?

963
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:25,862
Yes.

964
01:28:26,860 --> 01:28:29,201
Everything I love...

965
01:28:30,102 --> 01:28:31,902
dies.

966
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:36,410
I can't lose you, Jeannie.

967
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:38,483
Don't call me that name, Pete.

968
01:28:38,533 --> 01:28:41,843
Who was she? Who was Jeannie?
Was her real name Genevieve?

969
01:28:41,844 --> 01:28:43,905
- Was she my mother, Pete?
- I don't know.

970
01:28:43,906 --> 01:28:47,087
You do know.
I can't stay here any longer.

971
01:28:47,088 --> 01:28:48,699
Yes.

972
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:50,742
She was your mother.

973
01:28:53,591 --> 01:28:56,436
- Now are you happy?
- What happened to her?

974
01:28:56,437 --> 01:28:57,563
Meg, for the love of heavens...

975
01:28:57,564 --> 01:28:59,665
- She was killed, wasn't she?
- But it was an accident, I...

976
01:28:59,666 --> 01:29:02,259
It wasn't an accident.
Something awful must've happened.

977
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:05,461
- You must have hated her or...
- Hated her?

978
01:29:05,748 --> 01:29:08,030
I've worshiped your mother.

979
01:29:08,031 --> 01:29:09,801
No man ever loved a woman more.

980
01:29:09,871 --> 01:29:12,699
But she married your father,
a man without heart, without soul.

981
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:16,551
- Is that why you killed her?
- No, no, no, you've got to believe me, Meg.

982
01:29:16,568 --> 01:29:18,579
I never hurt your mother.

983
01:29:18,580 --> 01:29:21,590
I never even so much as
said a harsh word to her.

984
01:29:21,606 --> 01:29:23,456
And then when you were
born in the red house,

985
01:29:23,457 --> 01:29:25,859
I loved you like
you were my own.

986
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:27,969
That's why I
remembered the house.

987
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:30,360
It was his fault.

988
01:29:30,561 --> 01:29:32,861
He got jealous.

989
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:35,820
He took to accusing Jeannie
and me of...

990
01:29:36,421 --> 01:29:38,221
bad things.

991
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:40,388
He lied.

992
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:42,969
But the worst was when...

993
01:29:42,970 --> 01:29:45,499
he was going to take
Jeannie and you away.

994
01:29:45,562 --> 01:29:48,971
I ran to the red house, to plead
with your mother not to go.

995
01:29:48,972 --> 01:29:51,159
I heard him coming
home in the surrey.

996
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:54,726
I begged her to decide
before it was too late.

997
01:29:55,210 --> 01:29:57,299
She got frightened.

998
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:59,729
I don't know why.

999
01:29:59,730 --> 01:30:02,132
She screamed.

1000
01:30:02,524 --> 01:30:05,050
- There was no reason I wasn't going.
- Then you did kill her.

1001
01:30:05,051 --> 01:30:07,459
No, it was an accident,
I just tried to keep her quiet.

1002
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:10,466
I just put my hand over
her mouth, only that.

1003
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:17,004
She was smothered.

1004
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:22,400
Then he came in the door,

1005
01:30:22,401 --> 01:30:24,601
and went crazy.

1006
01:30:25,140 --> 01:30:27,440
I knew it was his fault.

1007
01:30:27,541 --> 01:30:29,941
He was the one
who killed Jeannie.

1008
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:31,862
I picked up a bullwhip,

1009
01:30:31,863 --> 01:30:33,458
and I beat him!

1010
01:30:33,459 --> 01:30:35,259
Till he wasn't
handsome anymore,

1011
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:37,960
until he was dead, finished!

1012
01:30:39,390 --> 01:30:41,618
I was out of my mind.

1013
01:30:41,619 --> 01:30:44,160
I picked up their bodies and
I put them in the surrey.

1014
01:30:44,161 --> 01:30:46,609
I whipped the horses
into the icehouse.

1015
01:30:46,610 --> 01:30:48,897
The spring had broken
through in there.

1016
01:30:48,898 --> 01:30:51,239
The mud was deep, deep enough.

1017
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:53,071
When I came to my senses, I...

1018
01:30:53,072 --> 01:30:56,213
I tried to kill myself,
I jumped into the quarry.

1019
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:59,241
Ellen should've
let me die there.

1020
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:01,908
Nath! Nath!

1021
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:03,487
Nath, where are you?

1022
01:31:07,529 --> 01:31:08,919
Nath's gone.

1023
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:12,626
He's taken your rifle, he's gone
to the woods. Teller will kill him.

1024
01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:14,367
I love him, Pete.

1025
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:20,306
I love him like you
loved Jeannie, Pete.

1026
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:23,170
I don't know the woods at night,
Pete, you do.

1027
01:31:23,312 --> 01:31:25,199
You've got to help me stop him.

1028
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:28,022
I'll forget what happened.
I won't hold it against you.

1029
01:31:28,023 --> 01:31:31,987
You can make up for what you did. Jeannie
will forgive you, she'll forgive you, Pete.

1030
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,628
I can end this?

1031
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:36,707
I can be free.

1032
01:31:39,236 --> 01:31:40,779
There was a truck
road to the red house.

1033
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:44,149
You go ahead, start the truck.
I'll catch up with you.

1034
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:56,649
Listen.

1035
01:31:57,152 --> 01:32:00,139
- My pop must've found out...
- I wish that's all that was.

1036
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:02,242
What do you mean?

1037
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:05,504
They're after me.

1038
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:16,482
- Pop'll whip me.
- Stop that crying. Stop it!

1039
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,409
You don't really love me!

1040
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:34,480
Better stop!

1041
01:32:37,228 --> 01:32:39,239
I didn't know what I was doing.

1042
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:42,826
Maybe Teller didn't either, kid,
but it all adds up to murder.

1043
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:44,520
Murder?

1044
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:10,880
Look out, that branch!

1045
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,220
We can't make it this way.

1046
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:21,502
Who's there?

1047
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:25,201
It's Ray Hall, Nath.
I came as quickly as I could.

1048
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:28,469
I telephoned the
state highway police.

1049
01:33:30,974 --> 01:33:32,799
- Any signs of Teller?
- No, Sheriff.

1050
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,865
- But I heard a car here in the woods.
- Yeah, so did I.

1051
01:34:04,780 --> 01:34:06,347
Is Teller here?

1052
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:07,944
Not yet.

1053
01:34:07,945 --> 01:34:09,432
We're on time.

1054
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,890
Come, dear.

1055
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:33,507
Don't be afraid.

1056
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:04,807
Step out of the door,
he'll see us.

1057
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,570
Why must we bolt the door?

1058
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:52,087
Nothing has changed.

1059
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:03,107
Just as it was.

1060
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,467
Just as it was.

1061
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:38,180
She's just like you, Jeannie.

1062
01:36:39,181 --> 01:36:41,542
I've come to plead
with you not to go.

1063
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,509
Don't go with him, Jeannie.

1064
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:46,046
I can't live without you.

1065
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:48,289
Pete, we've come
here to help Nath.

1066
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:50,588
- He could be killed.
- Yes!

1067
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:53,086
I'd kill to keep you here.

1068
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:56,221
Does Herb love you that
much, enough to kill for you?

1069
01:37:10,913 --> 01:37:12,739
When he comes back
to the village,

1070
01:37:12,740 --> 01:37:14,441
we'll be gone, you
and the baby and me.

1071
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:16,349
We'll be gone.

1072
01:37:16,353 --> 01:37:19,639
And I swear before God I'll kill him
before I'll let him take you away.

1073
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:22,050
You stay here with me, Jeannie.

1074
01:37:22,915 --> 01:37:24,979
There isn't much time left.

1075
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:26,967
Decide, Jeannie, decide!

1076
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:32,900
Oh, Nath!

1077
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:34,668
Nath!

1078
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:38,660
Meg!

1079
01:37:46,419 --> 01:37:48,209
Stop it!

1080
01:37:49,410 --> 01:37:51,419
Open the door, Meg!

1081
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:53,762
- Jeannie!
- Meg!

1082
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:57,166
- Open up or I'll shoot it.
- Jeannie.

1083
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,571
Meg, it's Nath.

1084
01:38:20,952 --> 01:38:22,839
Stop or I'll shoot!

1085
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:26,348
Stop, Pete!
Stop or I'll shoot!

1086
01:39:20,198 --> 01:39:23,219
I thought I better finish what Ellen
started out to do, sweetheart.

1087
01:39:23,220 --> 01:39:25,446
I set fire to the red house.

1088
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:32,448
Looking forward's much
better than looking back.
