1
00:03:28,018 --> 00:03:30,145
...must be stopped.

2
00:03:30,287 --> 00:03:34,917
You, and all the school-parent
groups about the country,

3
00:03:35,058 --> 00:03:37,583
and you must stand united on this,

4
00:03:37,727 --> 00:03:42,494
can stamp out this frightful
assassin of our youth.

5
00:03:42,632 --> 00:03:45,965
You can do it by initiating
compulsory education

6
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:48,866
on the subject of narcotics
in general.

7
00:03:49,005 --> 00:03:52,463
But dread marihuana in particular!

8
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:55,874
That is why we are meeting,
ladies and gentlemen,

9
00:03:56,012 --> 00:04:00,108
to lay the foundation for
a nationwide campaign by you

10
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,880
to demand by law
such compulsory education.

11
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:09,822
For it is only through enlightenment
that this scourge can be wiped out.

12
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,553
Out of the traffic in these drugs,

13
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:18,157
a lawlessness we can hardly estimate
has grown and is now flourishing.

14
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:22,203
lt exists in almost every city
and hamlet in the country.

15
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:26,540
You will find it interesting
and important to know

16
00:04:26,676 --> 00:04:30,635
some of the methods used
to bring drugs into the country

17
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,476
and the work of the forces
of law and order,

18
00:04:33,616 --> 00:04:35,982
which are daily
combatting the traffic,

19
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:40,215
always risking their agents' lives.

20
00:04:40,357 --> 00:04:47,559
The Dept. of Narcotics, Washington,
wages this ceaseless fight.

21
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:57,335
l have a letter of vital importance
from someone in the Narcotics Bureau.

22
00:04:57,474 --> 00:05:00,307
l'm going to read this letter to you.

23
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:03,403
''My dear Dr. Carroll:

24
00:05:03,546 --> 00:05:07,846
''The suppression of the use of
marihuana and the forces behind it

25
00:05:07,984 --> 00:05:11,886

this department is engaged in.

26
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:16,390
''At the outset, there is
one vital fact l would submit.

27
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:21,293

l speak of the school-parent groups

in stamping out this scourge.

53
00:07:09,906 --> 00:07:13,706
No doubt, many of you do not believe
that these things do happen,

54
00:07:13,843 --> 00:07:15,868
that they cannot happen to you.

55
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:19,709
You may also believe the facts
have been exaggerated.

56
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:24,013
Let me tell you something that
happened here in our own city.

57
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:26,348
You probably read about it.

58
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:30,255
However, l'll give you
the real facts behind the case.

59
00:07:30,393 --> 00:07:33,692
An apartment was near
one of our high schools.

60
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,890
lt was run by a woman
known as Mae Coleman.

61
00:07:59,022 --> 00:08:00,455
Hey.

62
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,286
-Come on, Mae, get up.
-What time is it?

63
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:07,123
Time to clean this place.
lt's like the Marines landed.

64
00:08:07,263 --> 00:08:11,199
That bunch last night was high enough
to defeat the Marines.

65
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:14,701
Get on the job.
Some of the kids may be up later.

66
00:08:14,837 --> 00:08:18,204
Jack, we don't need to drag
those young kids up here.

67
00:08:18,341 --> 00:08:20,206
Just button up your lip.

68
00:08:20,343 --> 00:08:24,973
Always squawking about something.
You got more static than a radio.

69
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,592
Ah, greetings.

70
00:09:15,732 --> 00:09:19,566
-Hello, fella, how are you?
-Fine, how are you? Come in!

71
00:09:19,702 --> 00:09:21,670
Glad to be here.

72
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,509
-ls Mae in?
-She'll be right in. Just sit down.

73
00:09:29,412 --> 00:09:33,007
-What kind of a joint is this, Eddie?
-lt's OK, Gwen.

74
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:36,641
-See, they probably had a party.
-Ahh.

75
00:09:40,223 --> 00:09:42,987
-A couple of your customers, Mae.
-Yeah?

76
00:09:43,126 --> 00:09:47,586
They know what they're doing, not
like the young kids you bring here.

77
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,166
All right, all right.
Listen, l'm gonna blow.

78
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,358
Where you going?

79
00:09:52,502 --> 00:09:56,700
Got to make some deliveries.
l'll bring back a couple of kids.

80
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:02,209
-Oh, l wish you'd lay off those kids.
-Why don't you get over your complex?

81
00:10:42,318 --> 00:10:47,153
By the way, Ralph, l'm giving a party
Saturday at my grandmother's.

82
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,690
The place with the pool. Coming?

83
00:10:49,826 --> 00:10:52,090
-Maybe.
-l'd like to have you.

84
00:10:52,228 --> 00:10:56,062
-OK, l'll probably drop over.
-So long, Ralph.

85
00:10:57,066 --> 00:11:00,160
-Hey, Ralph! How are you, kid?
-Fine, Jack. You?

86
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:03,429
-Oh, great. Where you headed?
-Oh...

87
00:11:04,774 --> 00:11:07,140
Hey, how do you like that?

88
00:11:12,415 --> 00:11:15,145
That's the one l was
telling you about.

89
00:11:15,284 --> 00:11:18,742
Very nice.

90
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:22,016
l don't know why you make such a fuss
over Ralph.

91
00:11:22,158 --> 00:11:25,958
He's a swell swimmer.
Made the freshman team at college.

92
00:11:26,095 --> 00:11:29,963
My dad knows his family.
None of them are any good.

93
00:11:30,099 --> 00:11:32,761
-Parents just got a divorce in Paris.
-Yeah?

94
00:11:32,902 --> 00:11:37,032
Ralph runs around pretty much
on his own. He's been in trouble.

95
00:11:37,173 --> 00:11:39,573
Well, l don't go around with him.

96
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:43,702
You better not. He's too old for us.
That's what my dad said.

97
00:11:45,715 --> 00:11:48,047
-Hello, Mary. Hi, Bill.
-Hi, Ralph.

98
00:11:48,184 --> 00:11:51,278
Hi, Ralph. You know my brother Jimmy,
don't you?

99
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,614
How are you?

100
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:57,055
l'd like you to meet a friend
of mine, Jack Perry. Mary, Bill.

101
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:58,524
Glad to know you.

102
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:02,427
-We're going to Joe's, come along.
-We're playing doubles.

103
00:12:02,565 --> 00:12:05,193
You can play anytime. Let's have fun.

104
00:12:05,334 --> 00:12:07,495
We can't today. Some other time.

105
00:12:07,637 --> 00:12:09,161
-Can l come?
-Sure.

106
00:12:09,305 --> 00:12:12,206
Hey, l'll see you at dinner, Sis.

107
00:12:13,843 --> 00:12:16,835
-Don't be late, Jimmy.
-l won't.

108
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,169
-Hello, Joe.
-Jimmy!

109
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:48,038
Hi, Agnes!

110
00:12:48,177 --> 00:12:52,136
-He ain't no paper man!
-That's ''Hot Fingers'' Pirelli.

111
00:12:52,281 --> 00:12:54,442
He swings out with a mess of jive!

112
00:12:54,584 --> 00:12:56,449
-You want to dance?
-Do l!

113
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:17,563
Mae's expecting us
at the apartment later.

114
00:13:17,707 --> 00:13:21,404
-Any new prospects?
-Maybe.

115
00:14:14,964 --> 00:14:17,990
Oh, Jimmy, you're wonderful!

116
00:14:19,035 --> 00:14:21,765
You just finding that out?

117
00:14:26,676 --> 00:14:29,509
-Why can't we go now?
-Sure.

118
00:14:29,645 --> 00:14:33,206
We're having a party
at my girlfriend's. Want to come?

119
00:14:33,349 --> 00:14:37,308
-l'd love to. You want to, don't you?
-Oh, sure.

120
00:14:37,453 --> 00:14:42,152
-Any place with you.
-Come along, we can all go in my car.

121
00:14:46,195 --> 00:14:49,164
-See you later, Joe.
-So long.

122
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:06,307
-You're sweet to help me, Bill.
-Anything but Domestic Science.

123
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:09,907
Don't you want to learn about
running your own home?

124
00:15:10,052 --> 00:15:14,489
The answer is no. You know, after
that session we had yesterday,

125
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:18,218
l told Mother the trouble
with her pot roast gravy was

126
00:15:18,361 --> 00:15:22,320
she hadn't added three heaping
teaspoonfuls of olive oil.

127
00:15:22,465 --> 00:15:26,196
-What did she say?
-She threw me out of the kitchen.

128
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:28,462
-No wonder.
-Hello, children.

129
00:15:28,604 --> 00:15:31,198
-Hello, Mother.
-Hello, Mrs. Lane.

130
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:36,243
-That was sweet of you, Mother.
-Hot chocolate! Thanks, Mrs. Lane!

131
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:39,974
You can't study on empty stomachs.
Enjoy yourselves.

132
00:15:40,116 --> 00:15:43,051
-He will.
-She will too, Mrs. Lane.

133
00:15:43,185 --> 00:15:48,748
-May l?
-Thank you, sir. You're so very kind.

134
00:15:50,593 --> 00:15:54,427
Mary, before we do that math,
let's read this. lt's swell.

-Don't you like it?
-Uh-huh.

137
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:00,829
When l study this, l think of you.

138
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:04,133
l feel as though you're
there beside me.

139
00:16:06,075 --> 00:16:08,202
Oh, listen.

140

00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,846
-Goodbye, Bill.
-So long.

149
00:16:48,984 --> 00:16:50,611
Gosh, l...

150
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,015
Oh, Bill!

151
00:16:55,257 --> 00:16:59,057
l guess l'm all right. Bye! Bye!

152
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:04,025
-Hey, Daddy!
-Oh, Junior!

153
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,396
There you are!

154
00:17:07,803 --> 00:17:12,399
-Hey, Dad, you got anything for me?
-Don't bother your father.

155
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:15,442
-Have you?
-There you are.

156
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:18,479
What made you so late, Bill?
l was worried.

157
00:17:18,614 --> 00:17:20,445
Oh, l had to study, Ma.

158
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:24,849
He was not. l saw him out
walking with his girl.

159
00:17:24,987 --> 00:17:27,080
Bill's got a girlfriend...

160
00:17:27,223 --> 00:17:29,953
-Make him stop!
-Junior!

161
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:35,394
-Well, Bill has got a girl.
-Quiet! And put that candy away.

162
00:17:35,531 --> 00:17:40,093
-You shouldn't have given it to him.
-His girl's name is Mary.

163
00:17:40,236 --> 00:17:42,727
Hey, l'll shut you up.

164
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:46,840
Bill! Junior! Quit that carrying on!

165
00:17:46,976 --> 00:17:49,638
They're all right, they're young.

166
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,212
Mary's little lamb.

167
00:17:52,348 --> 00:17:54,248
l didn't mean it, Bill!

168
00:17:54,383 --> 00:17:59,343
What l'm burned up about is that you
didn't say Bill had a swell girl!

169
00:17:59,488 --> 00:18:02,355
Gee. lt must be love.

170
00:18:02,491 --> 00:18:07,019
-She must be swell if you like her.
-You must want something.

171
00:18:07,163 --> 00:18:12,362
-Come on, what is it?
-lt's my model plane. lt won't work.

172
00:18:12,501 --> 00:18:17,302
Gosh, Bill, you could fix it.
You can fix anything!

173
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:20,408
OK, l'll fix it.

174
00:18:21,443 --> 00:18:24,674
-Dad, read me the funny papers.
-Here we are.

175
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:32,416
-Hey, Bill!
-Oh hello, Jimmy.

176
00:18:33,389 --> 00:18:37,120
Mary went home. Her mother
wanted her to go to the dressmaker.

177
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:39,159
Oh thanks, Jimmy.

178
00:18:39,295 --> 00:18:41,957
l see Mary let you have the car.

179
00:18:42,097 --> 00:18:46,591
-Can l take you anyplace?
-l wasn't going anyplace special.

180
00:18:46,735 --> 00:18:51,331
How about driving over to Joe's place
with me? l'll buy you a soda!

181
00:18:51,473 --> 00:18:55,341
-l never drink that stuff!
-l'll buy you something else.

182
00:18:55,477 --> 00:18:59,675
-You're on the hook for a root beer.
-Swell!

183
00:19:10,893 --> 00:19:14,590
-Hi. What'll you have?
-Hey, Jimmy!

184
00:19:15,898 --> 00:19:18,162
Hi Jimmy. Hi, Bill.
Come on, slide in.

185
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,736
-Hello, Blanche. Hello, Ralph.
-How've you been, Ralph?

186
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,771
Two sodas...
l mean one soda and one root beer.

187
00:19:24,907 --> 00:19:28,707
-How's Mae?
-Fine. We're going to her apartment.

188
00:19:28,844 --> 00:19:30,641
-Could Bill come?
-Sure.

189
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:33,247
-l don't know...
-Come on, Bill!

190
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:35,782
-Thanks, but...
-Come on, Bill.

191
00:19:35,918 --> 00:19:40,150
-Mary won't be jealous.
-A lot of the kids will be there.

192
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:44,191
l don't know... l really shouldn't...
Well, OK.

193
00:20:09,318 --> 00:20:12,685
-Hiya, kids!
-Hello, Jack, whaddya say?

194
00:20:12,821 --> 00:20:15,289
Yeah, come on in.

195
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:19,758
-Jack!
-Hi, Agnes!

196
00:20:22,564 --> 00:20:24,828
Come on, Bill, don't stand there!

197
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:29,063
Billy-hillbilly!

198
00:20:36,912 --> 00:20:40,211
-Hi, kids!
-Mae, this is Bill Harper. He's OK.

199
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:41,748
Hello.

200
00:20:41,884 --> 00:20:46,378
Well, if you say so, he's all right
with me. l'll be back in a minute.

201
00:20:46,522 --> 00:20:49,753
-Hiya, kids, how ya doing?
-OK. Hiya, Mae.

202
00:20:51,427 --> 00:20:55,295
-There's a new one in today.
-Yeah, Bill Harper.

203
00:20:55,431 --> 00:20:59,333
He's all right. Blanche's got
herself quite a yen for him.

204
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:02,699
Not bad. l didn't think she had
that much taste.

205
00:21:02,838 --> 00:21:07,969
She got Ralph not to bother her.
Now she's got her hooks out for Bill.

206
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:12,103
We haven't many more smokes.
You'd better go and get some.

207
00:21:12,247 --> 00:21:16,707
Couldn't you find that out this
morning? Now my car is in the shop.

208
00:21:16,852 --> 00:21:21,983
So what? That kid out there, Jimmy.
He's got a car. He'll take you.

209
00:21:22,124 --> 00:21:24,592
Come on, get going. Hurry up.

210
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:36,163
-Hey, Jimmy.
-Yup?

211
00:21:36,305 --> 00:21:38,364
l've got to go to Cedar Avenue.

212
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:40,532
-You got a car?
-My sister's.

213
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:45,045
-Mind giving me a lift?
-Why sure, come on.

214
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:03,229
No, thank you.

215
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:08,730
-Well, here we are.
-Oh, thanks.

216
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:11,669
Oh, Mae, don't forget me.

217
00:22:13,108 --> 00:22:16,077
l never forget you.

218
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:22,107
Oh dear. lf you want a good smoke,
try one of these.

219
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:41,327
l thought you were a sport.

220
00:22:42,371 --> 00:22:44,532
Of course, if you're afraid...

221
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:52,776
That's better! That's more like it.
l know you'll like it.

222
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:55,281
Just take a puff of this.

223
00:23:13,402 --> 00:23:17,270
-Just be a minute, kid.
-Give me a cigarette, will you?

224
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:40,651
-Hello, Jack.
-Hiya, Boss.

225
00:23:41,663 --> 00:23:45,622
-How's business?
-Great. Those kids sure go for it.

226
00:23:45,767 --> 00:23:48,634
-Swell.
-Had to get a few more cartons.

227
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,261
-Ran short today.
-All right.

228
00:23:51,406 --> 00:23:54,569
Danny? Pack ten gross for Jack Perry.

229
00:23:55,711 --> 00:23:59,579
Who? Pete Daley?
All right, send him in.

230
00:23:59,715 --> 00:24:02,047
lt's all right, stay where you are.

231
00:24:07,623 --> 00:24:10,456
l want to talk to you.

232
00:24:10,592 --> 00:24:13,561
Go ahead, Jack's OK. What's the beef?

233
00:24:13,695 --> 00:24:16,528
l never beefed
when l sold that rotten gin.

234
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:20,123
-You want dough, right?
-l don't need it that bad.

235
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:25,002
-Taking two-bit pieces from kids.
-Millions, begging to be taken.

236
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:29,770
-Don't be a dope.
-Just dope enough to draw the line.

237
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,672
OK, Pete. You know what
my policy's always been.

238
00:24:35,817 --> 00:24:40,481
lf the boys are not satisfied,
l'm always glad to have them retire.

239
00:24:40,622 --> 00:24:43,216
Retire permanently.

240
00:24:45,561 --> 00:24:47,552
So long.

241
00:24:54,436 --> 00:24:58,930
-l wish you had a couple of kids...
-Get out!

242
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:06,345
-Jack, pick up your stuff from Danny.
-OK, boss.

243
00:25:19,962 --> 00:25:24,831
-Let's go, Jack, l'm red-hot!
-Be careful or you'll be ice cold.

244
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:35,433
Take it easy, kid!

245
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:39,976
Slow down! You'll kill somebody!

246
00:26:02,638 --> 00:26:05,903
Mary, you're not eating
your breakfast again.

247
00:26:07,242 --> 00:26:11,269
Bill Harper hasn't been around
lately. Anything wrong?

248
00:26:11,413 --> 00:26:14,041
Why should there be anything wrong?

249
00:26:14,182 --> 00:26:18,642
There shouldn't be.
Whatever it is isn't serious, l know.

250
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:23,952
-l'm sorry for snapping at you.
-Don't worry about it, dear.

251
00:26:24,092 --> 00:26:28,688
Why don't you speak to Bill?
He'll be honest, whatever it is.

252
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:35,065
-l'm sure Bill Harper never lied.
-Yes, his mother says he never lies.

253
00:26:35,203 --> 00:26:38,036
-There, you see?
-lt'd be all right if...

254
00:26:38,206 --> 00:26:42,540
-...if l speak to him about it?
-Why, of course.

255
00:26:42,678 --> 00:26:46,478
-Oh, Jimmy.
-Hello, Ma.

256
00:26:46,615 --> 00:26:50,574
Sit down. l'll have your breakfast
for you in a moment.

257
00:26:55,457 --> 00:26:59,723
-ls something worrying you?
-What have l got to worry about?

258
00:26:59,861 --> 00:27:03,592
-Why don't you tell me?
-Don't cross-examine me!

259
00:27:03,732 --> 00:27:08,192
Jimmy!
Don't let Mother see you like that.

260
00:27:24,653 --> 00:27:30,023
There is certainly an organized gang
distributing narcotics to students.

261
00:27:30,158 --> 00:27:33,855
Not only in my school,
but all over the city.

262
00:27:33,995 --> 00:27:37,658
You government men have got to find
some way to stop it.

263
00:27:37,933 --> 00:27:40,766
Of course, l agree with you,
Dr. Carroll.

264
00:27:40,902 --> 00:27:44,804
But do you realize marihuana
is not like other forms of dope?

265
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,205
lt grows wild in almost every state
in the Union.

266
00:27:48,343 --> 00:27:51,938
Thus, there is no interstate commerce
in the drug.

267
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,708
So, the government's hands are tied.

268
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:59,446
Frankly, the only sure cure is a
widespread campaign in education.

269
00:27:59,588 --> 00:28:02,682
lt's fine to talk about education,
Mr. Wyatt.

270
00:28:02,824 --> 00:28:07,193
But we educators can't do anything
until the public is aroused.

271
00:28:07,329 --> 00:28:09,297
Let me show you something.

272
00:28:09,431 --> 00:28:13,561
ln 1 930, the records on marihuana
in the Narcotics Division

273
00:28:13,702 --> 00:28:16,637
scarcely filled a small folder
like this.

274
00:28:16,772 --> 00:28:20,071
Today, they fill cabinets.

275
00:28:23,712 --> 00:28:28,115
All these...devoted to
marihuana records.

276
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:33,146
Here is an example.

277
00:28:33,288 --> 00:28:37,520
A 16-year-old lad, apprehended
in the act of staging a holdup.

278
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:41,117
16 years old,
and a marihuana addict.

279
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:46,565
-Here is a most tragic case.
-Yes, l remember. Just a young boy.

280
00:28:46,701 --> 00:28:50,637
Under the drug's influence,
he killed his entire family.

281
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:53,900
Then there is the most
vicious type of case.

282
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:55,134
Here.

283
00:28:55,277 --> 00:29:00,044
ln Michigan. A young girl,
1 7 years old. A reefer smoker.

284
00:29:00,182 --> 00:29:03,515
Taken in a raid
in the company of five young men.

285
00:29:03,652 --> 00:29:05,586
Here is a most flagrant case.

286
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,883
l remember. The papers made
quite a play of it.

287
00:29:09,024 --> 00:29:14,985
-ln West Virginia, wasn't it?
-Yes. And there are hundreds of them.

288
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:20,295
l'd like to take these records.
l feel they would be invaluable to me

289
00:29:20,435 --> 00:29:25,600
-in combating the evil in my school.
-You're very welcome, Dr. Carroll.

290
00:29:28,844 --> 00:29:30,573
Sit down, Bill.

291
00:29:32,848 --> 00:29:36,284
There seems to be something wrong.
What is it?

292
00:29:36,418 --> 00:29:40,912
You were always a fine student.
You always had excellent grades.

293
00:29:41,056 --> 00:29:44,617
l guess the work is getting harder,
Dr. Carroll.

294
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:47,250
No. No, it isn't that.

295
00:29:47,395 --> 00:29:51,525
Bill, l'd like to help you.
But l can't, unless you let me.

296
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,600
You're undermining your health.

297
00:29:53,735 --> 00:29:58,468
There's nothing, Dr. Carroll, really.
l'll study harder, honest.

298
00:29:58,607 --> 00:30:03,101
Honest? lf you were being honest
with me and honest with yourself,

299
00:30:03,245 --> 00:30:07,113
l'm afraid you'd tell me
an entirely different story.

300
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:12,787
l'm going to ask you
a straightforward question.

301
00:30:13,221 --> 00:30:17,021
-l'd like a straightforward answer.
-Yes, sir.

302
00:30:17,158 --> 00:30:20,821
lsn't it true that you have,
perhaps unwillingly,

303
00:30:20,962 --> 00:30:26,594
acquired a harmful habit through
association with undesirable people?

304
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:32,734
-Well?
-Oh no, sir. l haven't, Dr. Carroll.

305
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:35,934
Well, that is, you see, l'm...

306
00:30:36,077 --> 00:30:38,739
...worried about something at home.

307
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,577
All right, my boy.
We'll just have to let it go at that.

308
00:30:42,717 --> 00:30:46,380
But remember, if you ever
want to confide in me,

309
00:30:46,521 --> 00:30:50,685
-no one will ever be the wiser.
-Thank you, Dr. Carroll.

310
00:30:57,499 --> 00:31:01,333
-Hi, Mary, want to play?
-Thanks, l'm waiting for someone.

311
00:31:01,469 --> 00:31:05,462
lf you're waiting for Bill,
he hasn't been here for weeks.

312
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:11,109
-Come on, Jimmy, play something hot!
-OK!

313
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:22,586
Come on, Billy! Dance with me!

314
00:31:44,379 --> 00:31:48,782
-Didn't take Bill long to catch on.
-Don't take any of them long.

315
00:31:53,855 --> 00:31:58,383
-Hey, don't you ever get fed?
-You're feeding me, can't you see?

316
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:07,734
-Give me a knife and fork, will you?
-Get it yourself.

317
00:32:38,366 --> 00:32:41,699
Come on, Bill!

318
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:45,567
Come on! Come on, Bill!

319
00:32:45,707 --> 00:32:49,768
Come on, Bill.

320
00:33:31,352 --> 00:33:34,378
-Good morning, we're the police.
-Good morning.

321
00:33:34,522 --> 00:33:39,653
We're tracing a hit-and-run.
Someone caught part of the license.

322
00:33:39,794 --> 00:33:43,252
-We're checking all numbers like it.
-l'll try to help.

323
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:48,700
-Do you recall the 29th, last month?
-The day before Mother's birthday.

324
00:33:48,837 --> 00:33:52,898
Yes, l left school and went
to the dressmaker with mother.

325
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:57,000
-l was there all afternoon.
-Did you loan your car to two men?

326
00:33:57,145 --> 00:34:02,310
-No, l had the car all afternoon.
-Thanks, Miss. Sorry to trouble you.

327
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,510
Tell me... Did they...?
Was the person killed?

328
00:34:05,653 --> 00:34:10,750
Fortunately not. But that's still
no excuse for hit-and-run driving.

329
00:34:21,903 --> 00:34:24,633
Has Jimmy Lane been here today?

330
00:34:25,673 --> 00:34:30,542
He was in. He went over to
Mae's place. You know where that is.

331
00:34:30,678 --> 00:34:36,878
He was going to wait for me here,
so he didn't give me Mae's address.

332
00:34:37,018 --> 00:34:41,455
Are you sure Jimmy didn't leave
any message for me? Mary?

333
00:34:43,691 --> 00:34:46,182
No, he didn't.

334
00:34:46,327 --> 00:34:50,787
But l guess you're OK.
l'll write it down for you.

335
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:07,638
-Mary! Come right in!
-ls Jimmy here?

336
00:35:07,782 --> 00:35:10,182
Oh, why, he's around somewhere.

337
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:14,118
l think he went to take Agnes home.
He'll be right back.

338
00:35:14,255 --> 00:35:17,053
Sit down, Mary.
Let me take your coat.

339
00:35:19,861 --> 00:35:22,489
Who's the new kid just came in?

340
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:32,606
lt's that gal Ralph's
gone overboard for.

341
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,073
We've never been able
to get her up here before.

342
00:35:41,216 --> 00:35:44,811
Hey, hey. Scram, will ya?

343
00:36:11,412 --> 00:36:13,972
-Smoke, Mary?
-Thanks.

344
00:36:14,115 --> 00:36:17,949
-Are you sure Jimmy'll be back soon?
-Sure. Any minute.

345
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:25,683
Say, what's the matter?
Am l an orphan?

346
00:37:26,688 --> 00:37:31,057
-Where do you put it? A hollow leg?
-Thanks, dear.

347
00:37:32,026 --> 00:37:34,051
Here, Mary.

348
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:39,494
-Oh, Mary, give me a kiss, Mary!
-No! Don't! Don't!

349
00:37:39,634 --> 00:37:43,502
-Please, no!
-Oh, Mary!

350
00:37:44,405 --> 00:37:47,431
You leave me alone!

351
00:37:48,409 --> 00:37:50,900
-Go away!
-Mary! Everybody's...

352
00:37:57,685 --> 00:38:02,486
Leave me alone! Oh, leave me alone!

353
00:38:03,524 --> 00:38:06,618
-Everything's over.
-Leave me be!

354
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,395
Ralph! Ralph!

355
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,498
Look!

356
00:39:21,135 --> 00:39:23,399
Jack, is she all right?

357
00:39:28,576 --> 00:39:30,737
She's dead.

358
00:39:33,915 --> 00:39:37,078
Mae, get me some water.

359
00:39:37,752 --> 00:39:39,720
Now listen, you two.

360
00:39:39,854 --> 00:39:43,312
Get out of here. Forget you were ever
in here today.

361
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:46,586
l'll handle this. Now get going.

362
00:39:58,739 --> 00:40:00,730
Give it to me.

363
00:40:09,183 --> 00:40:11,151
Here.

364
00:40:21,929 --> 00:40:23,658
Mary?

365
00:40:34,342 --> 00:40:38,779
Mary? Mary!

366
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:44,876
-What happened?
-You killed her.

367
00:40:47,889 --> 00:40:51,325
Mary, Mary!

368
00:40:52,994 --> 00:40:56,259
Oh, Mary...

369
00:40:56,397 --> 00:41:00,231
Look. After l scram,
you call the cops.

370
00:41:00,368 --> 00:41:02,836
And this is your story. Remember it.

371
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:07,964
These kids came here for some beer.
From the kitchen, you heard shots.

372
00:41:08,109 --> 00:41:10,805
You came in, and
that's what you found.

373
00:41:10,945 --> 00:41:13,846
Just stick to that story.

374
00:41:15,116 --> 00:41:17,243
Mary!

375
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:23,147
Mary! Speak to me! Mary!

376
00:41:56,924 --> 00:42:02,055
-Hello, Jack.
-l was just talking to a friend.

377
00:42:02,196 --> 00:42:04,096
A cop.

378
00:42:05,132 --> 00:42:09,000
Sergeant on the homicide squad.

379
00:42:09,136 --> 00:42:13,596
-Guy you hit that day died.
-Died? You... l mean you didn't...?

380
00:42:13,741 --> 00:42:18,838
No. l didn't crack,
and l'm not going to.

381
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:22,472
-Nobody'll know you drove that car.
-Thanks, Jack.

382
00:42:23,918 --> 00:42:27,354
Just don't say you were ever
up in Mae's apartment.

383
00:42:27,488 --> 00:42:29,649
Why sure, Jack!

384
00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:32,987
OK.

385
00:42:41,802 --> 00:42:46,535
Your honor, l'd like to recall
Dr. Alfred Carroll to the stand.

386
00:42:46,674 --> 00:42:50,132
Call Dr. Alfred Carroll to the stand.

387
00:42:59,787 --> 00:43:03,314
Dr. Carroll, as principal of
the Lakeside High School,

388
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:05,584
did you, in the last three months,

389
00:43:05,726 --> 00:43:09,355
notice changes in the demeanor of
your student, William Harper?

390
00:43:09,497 --> 00:43:12,364
Yes, in a number of things.

391
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:17,995
For example, at times,
disassociation of ideas.

392
00:43:19,006 --> 00:43:24,842
Also, l happened to attend the recent
interscholastic tennis matches.

393
00:43:24,979 --> 00:43:29,382
While Bill Harper had been considered
an exceedingly good player,

394
00:43:29,517 --> 00:43:33,044
l saw him miss the ball by
as much as three or four feet.

395
00:43:33,187 --> 00:43:37,123
This, l understand, could be
attributed to the use of marihuana.

396
00:43:37,258 --> 00:43:39,954
lt causes errors in time and space.

397
00:43:40,094 --> 00:43:41,391
Objection, your honor!

398
00:43:41,529 --> 00:43:44,987
The witness isn't qualified
as an expert on narcotics.

399
00:43:45,132 --> 00:43:49,466
Sustained. Dr. Carroll has been
called merely as a character witness.

400
00:43:49,937 --> 00:43:55,432
Although you didn't personally know
the defendant was using marihuana,

401
00:43:55,576 --> 00:44:00,809
did you notice any changes that would
lead you to believe, as an educator,

402
00:44:00,948 --> 00:44:03,178
that he was under some severe stress

403
00:44:03,317 --> 00:44:06,548
which might possibly have been
induced by some drug?

404
00:44:06,687 --> 00:44:10,680
Yes. l recall distinctly,
a few weeks ago.

405
00:44:10,825 --> 00:44:13,385
lt was during a class
of English literature.

406
00:44:13,527 --> 00:44:17,429
There was a serious discussion of
Shakespeare's <i>Romeo and Ju</i>/<i>iet</i>,

407
00:44:17,565 --> 00:44:22,093
when he burst into an uncontrollable
fit of hysterical laughter.

408
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:24,228
Oh, by the way, Dr. Carroll,

409
00:44:24,371 --> 00:44:29,172
six months ago, what was your opinion
regarding the character of my client?

410
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:32,302
He was a fine, upstanding
American boy.

411
00:44:32,446 --> 00:44:34,812
A good scholar, a good athlete,

412
00:44:34,949 --> 00:44:40,148
and representative of the caliber of
young men we are proud to graduate.

413
00:44:47,128 --> 00:44:51,690
Oh, snap out of it, will you?
lt's not our fault.

414
00:44:52,733 --> 00:44:57,693
Why'd l ever bring him up there,
anyway? He's just a kid.

415
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:01,501
-They can't hang him.
-Shut up, shut up!

416
00:45:01,642 --> 00:45:05,373
Why don't you let yourself go? Talk.

417
00:45:05,513 --> 00:45:08,641
Go off your nuts
and have me that way too.

418
00:45:08,783 --> 00:45:11,411
-lt's his own fault, wasn't it?
-Shut up!

419
00:45:11,552 --> 00:45:16,512
They've got us hidden out, haven't
they? The cops can't find us!

420
00:45:16,657 --> 00:45:20,718
Jack. Jack, l want
to get out of this place.

421
00:45:21,729 --> 00:45:26,462
You'll stay here as long as we have
to keep those two under cover.

422
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:31,264
Till the trial's over...or the boss
gets a better idea.

423
00:45:31,405 --> 00:45:36,069
-But they're getting on my nerves.
-lt can't last much longer.

424
00:45:37,144 --> 00:45:40,671
l'm not worried about her.
We got to keep him gagged.

425
00:45:40,815 --> 00:45:43,045
Oh, he's about ready to crack.

426
00:45:43,217 --> 00:45:45,811
Just keep him from having
too many reefers.

427
00:45:45,953 --> 00:45:48,148
Any day now, that punk'll get hot.

428
00:45:48,289 --> 00:45:52,658
He'll probably spill and tell all
if he gets a chance.

429
00:45:55,629 --> 00:45:58,792
l don't think he'll get it.

430
00:46:00,734 --> 00:46:03,635
-l'll see you later.
-Where are you going?

431
00:46:03,771 --> 00:46:06,331
l'm going to see the boss.

432
00:46:17,918 --> 00:46:20,978
-Hello, Jack.
-Hello, Boss.

433
00:46:25,025 --> 00:46:29,018
-What'll we do about that Wiley guy?
-Still jittery, huh?

434
00:46:29,163 --> 00:46:32,428
-l don't know what he'll do.
-Feed him hot sticks.

435
00:46:32,566 --> 00:46:36,229
Mae's doing that. No good.

436
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:40,431
l got a hunch that he's due to crack
when that Harper verdict comes in.

437
00:46:40,574 --> 00:46:45,375
He's liable to take a powder on us
and blow his topper to the D.A.

438
00:46:45,512 --> 00:46:52,418
You mean you think we'd all be better
off if he never heard the verdict?

439
00:46:52,553 --> 00:46:54,578
Well,

440
00:46:54,722 --> 00:46:57,054
what are you waiting for?

441
00:47:06,867 --> 00:47:10,928
You, ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, have a duty to perform.

442
00:47:11,071 --> 00:47:15,007
A duty to yourselves
and to our community.

443
00:47:15,142 --> 00:47:18,600
Mary Lane is dead.

444
00:47:18,746 --> 00:47:21,112
The evidence you've
heard at this trial

445
00:47:21,248 --> 00:47:26,117
could not have failed to convince you
of the guilt of the defendant.

446
00:47:26,253 --> 00:47:29,711
By his own admission, he pressed
the trigger of the weapon

447
00:47:29,857 --> 00:47:35,454
that sent lovely and innocent Mary
Lane to a tragic and untimely death.

448
00:47:36,897 --> 00:47:42,130
We are not so much concerned about
the motives as about the deed itself.

449
00:47:42,269 --> 00:47:47,832
While the defendant has told you that
he saw someone attacking Mary Lane,

450
00:47:47,975 --> 00:47:50,739
and that his mind went blank
from that moment on,

451
00:47:50,878 --> 00:47:56,839
the defense has not produced
one witness to verify that statement.

452
00:47:57,551 --> 00:48:03,217
Now, ladies and gentlemen, you've
heard able men testify at this trial,

453
00:48:03,357 --> 00:48:05,587
men who have tried
to bring out the fact

454
00:48:05,693 --> 00:48:09,356
that the defendant might have
become momentarily insane

455
00:48:09,496 --> 00:48:12,363
when he fired the shot
that killed Mary Lane.

456
00:48:12,499 --> 00:48:16,060
But the defense has been unable
to prove that he was insane.

457
00:48:16,203 --> 00:48:21,402
He was sane when he visited the
apartment where the tragedy occurred.

458
00:48:21,542 --> 00:48:23,567
He habitually visited the place.

459
00:48:23,711 --> 00:48:26,839
He was sane when he went to a bedroom
with another woman.

460
00:48:26,981 --> 00:48:32,419
You heard what went on in that room,
from the defendant's own lips.

461
00:48:32,553 --> 00:48:35,750
lnvolved as he was in
a tawdry love affair,

462
00:48:35,889 --> 00:48:40,553
Mary Lane was in the way.
She had found him out.

463
00:48:40,694 --> 00:48:45,063
ln a moment of anger, he deliberately
and willfully killed her.

464
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:48,168
lf such deeds are permitted
to go unpunished,

465
00:48:48,302 --> 00:48:51,499
this community would cease to be
a decent and safe place

466
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:54,630
for us or our children to live.

467
00:48:54,775 --> 00:48:58,267
l do not believe l have to plead,
or even demand,

468
00:48:58,412 --> 00:49:01,313
that you bring in a verdict
to punish the defendant

469
00:49:01,448 --> 00:49:04,713
for the crime that he has committed
against society.

470
00:49:04,852 --> 00:49:10,051
You are upright citizens. That is why
you were chosen to judge another.

471
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:15,594
As honest, upright citizens, there is
only one verdict you can find.

472
00:49:15,729 --> 00:49:19,563
And that is a verdict of ''Guilty.''

473
00:49:21,235 --> 00:49:26,901
And this court will be adjourned
until the jury's verdict is reached.

474
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:36,113
l suppose you all feel the same
about this case.

475
00:49:41,221 --> 00:49:46,249
-But he might have been insane.
-No, he knew what he was doing.

476
00:49:51,331 --> 00:49:55,495
-But supposing he was insane?
-You'll never make anyone believe it.

477
00:49:55,636 --> 00:49:58,264
We'll take a first vote.

478
00:50:12,686 --> 00:50:16,645
Eleven for conviction.
One for acquittal.

479
00:50:20,194 --> 00:50:23,652
There's a reasonable doubt
about his sanity. We can't...

480
00:50:23,797 --> 00:50:27,289
No doubt that he murdered her.
He admitted it himself.

481
00:50:27,434 --> 00:50:30,335
That wasn't the first time
he was there.

482
00:50:40,247 --> 00:50:44,616
We got to make an example before such
boys contaminate all of our children.

483
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:48,084
We can't let every murderer hide
behind a gag of insanity.

484
00:50:48,222 --> 00:50:52,716
Sure, they see red before they kill
somebody. But whose fault is it?

485
00:51:35,035 --> 00:51:37,663
Have you reached a verdict?

486
00:51:37,804 --> 00:51:38,930
We have.

487
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:42,008
The defendant will rise.

488
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,837
What is your verdict?

489
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:51,007
We find the defendant
guilty as charged.

490
00:51:55,622 --> 00:51:59,183
No!

491
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,170
Stop that racket! Stop it!

492
00:52:49,309 --> 00:52:53,803
What's the matter with you?
You give me the creeps.

493
00:52:59,953 --> 00:53:01,978
Mae. Mae!

494
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:06,187
-What do you want?
-Bring me some reefers.

495
00:53:14,301 --> 00:53:16,929
They're going to hang him.

496
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:22,667
-Blanche. They're going to hang him.
-Oh, come on. Get a hold of yourself.

497
00:53:24,378 --> 00:53:26,778
Here you are.

498
00:53:26,913 --> 00:53:29,905
And quit that crazy laughing!

499
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:34,510
-Where's Jack? l want to leave.
-You'll hang if you don't pipe down.

500
00:53:34,655 --> 00:53:38,591
l want to see Jack. Jack.

501
00:53:38,725 --> 00:53:41,717
l want to see Jack.

502
00:53:41,862 --> 00:53:43,591
Jack.

503
00:53:45,098 --> 00:53:48,932
-You'd better quiet him.
-l can't do anything with him.

504
00:53:55,409 --> 00:53:58,105
l've got to see Jack.

505
00:53:58,245 --> 00:54:01,476
We can't let that kid hang.

506
00:54:05,285 --> 00:54:09,415
He'll be here. Don't worry.
He'll be here in a little while.

507
00:54:09,556 --> 00:54:13,424
l've got to see him. l've got to...

508
00:54:28,742 --> 00:54:33,042
Come on, darling.
Everything'll be over soon.

509
00:54:35,248 --> 00:54:40,117
-Want me to play something for you?
-Yeah. That's it. Play something.

510
00:54:40,253 --> 00:54:43,222
All right. Come on.

511
00:54:45,525 --> 00:54:47,254
Sit down.

512
00:54:50,797 --> 00:54:54,358
Honey, give me a smoke, will you?

513
00:55:21,595 --> 00:55:24,029
Faster.

514
00:55:25,065 --> 00:55:27,693
Faster!

515
00:55:29,636 --> 00:55:31,604
Play faster!

516
00:55:34,741 --> 00:55:39,201
Faster. Play faster.

517
00:55:40,247 --> 00:55:42,078
Faster.

518
00:56:19,553 --> 00:56:22,386
l know what you want.

519
00:56:22,522 --> 00:56:24,547
You want to kill me.

520
00:56:25,492 --> 00:56:28,950
You're crazy. Take it easy, kid.

521
00:56:30,163 --> 00:56:33,064
l just want to talk to you.

522
00:56:52,152 --> 00:56:57,317
Hurry, hurry! There's a terrible
fight going on! Yes... Apartment 32.

523
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:20,837
Stop it! Stop it! Let go of me!
Take your hands off of me!

524
00:57:20,981 --> 00:57:24,849
Stop it! Take your hands off me!
Stop it!

525
00:57:24,985 --> 00:57:27,385
Stop it!

526
00:57:36,363 --> 00:57:40,925
<i>Who hired you and Jack Perry?</i>
<i>Are you ready to te</i>// <i>what you know?</i>

527
00:57:41,067 --> 00:57:42,694
<i>Yes!</i>

528
00:57:42,836 --> 00:57:45,566
/<i>'</i>// <i>ta</i>/<i>k</i>.

529
00:58:48,702 --> 00:58:53,833
lf we can gain leniency
for my client, she will plead guilty,

530
00:58:53,974 --> 00:58:57,842
and turn state's evidence
in the case of William Harper.

531
00:58:57,978 --> 00:59:01,505
l regret this court is not prepared
to bargain with justice.

532
00:59:01,648 --> 00:59:05,140
l'll tell anyway. l was there.
l saw it.

533
00:59:05,285 --> 00:59:08,846
l know who killed Mary. And l'll tell
you who killed Mary Lane.

534
00:59:08,989 --> 00:59:11,355
lt wasn't Bill. lt was Jack.

535
00:59:12,092 --> 00:59:16,552
Jack Perry. He shot Mary and then
he put the gun in Bill's hand.

536
00:59:16,696 --> 00:59:21,759
We were all at the apartment one day.
Mary came in looking for her brother.

537
00:59:21,901 --> 00:59:24,995
Bill and l,
we'd been in another room.

538
00:59:25,138 --> 00:59:28,699
Bill came in and caught Ralph
with Mary. They started to fight.

539
00:59:28,842 --> 00:59:33,905
Jack had the gun. He was going to hit
Bill over the head to make him stop.

540
00:59:34,047 --> 00:59:38,882
And then...then the gun went off.
l saw it.

541
00:59:39,019 --> 00:59:42,785
l can see it now. lt was horrible!

542
00:59:44,224 --> 00:59:50,060
Before we knew it, Mary...
Mary was dead.

543
00:59:53,667 --> 00:59:57,228
But you see, Judge, Bill didn't know
he hadn't killed Mary.

544
00:59:57,370 --> 01:00:01,067
He was so doped up,
they made him think he had.

545
01:00:01,207 --> 01:00:05,735
Ralph wanted to tell you, too.
Oh, if they'd only let him.

546
01:00:06,413 --> 01:00:10,611
But this is the truth, Judge.
l'm telling you the truth.

547
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:17,019
After Jack saw that Mary was dead,
he put the gun in Bill's hand.

548
01:00:17,157 --> 01:00:19,523
lt was Jack's fault.

549
01:00:19,659 --> 01:00:23,095
And it was my fault, too.

550
01:00:23,229 --> 01:00:27,325
l got all of them to come up
to the apartment.

551
01:00:27,467 --> 01:00:30,595
l'm just as much to blame.

552
01:00:30,737 --> 01:00:34,537
l am. l am.

553
01:00:35,308 --> 01:00:39,574
Do you wish to plead guilty to a
charge of fostering moral delinquency

554
01:00:39,713 --> 01:00:46,209
-in the case of William Harper?
-Yes, yes. l'm guilty. l am!

555
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,787
Prepare a statement
for signature, and an order

556
01:00:49,923 --> 01:00:55,759
setting aside the verdict in the case
of the People v. William Harper.

557
01:00:57,764 --> 01:01:02,861
ln the interests of justice, l shall
direct a verdict of not guilty.

558
01:01:13,413 --> 01:01:16,007
Sign here, please.

559
01:01:33,867 --> 01:01:39,703
You shall be brought into court on
Thursday, the 1 7th, for sentencing.

560
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:42,672
Meanwhile, you will be held
as a material witness

561
01:01:42,809 --> 01:01:45,869
in the case of
the People v. Ralph Wiley.

562
01:03:03,223 --> 01:03:06,624
We have come in the hearings
before this court today

563
01:03:06,759 --> 01:03:13,358
to what l hope will be the final
actions in a sad, unfortunate case,

564
01:03:13,499 --> 01:03:18,334
one whose horrible tragedy
will forever remain with me.

565
01:03:18,471 --> 01:03:22,100
l am happy to have been enabled,
before it was too late,

566
01:03:22,242 --> 01:03:27,612
to set aside the verdict in the case
of the People v. William Harper.

567
01:03:28,147 --> 01:03:29,808
But, young man,

568
01:03:29,949 --> 01:03:36,445
although this court believes that to
convict you would be grossly unjust,

569
01:03:36,589 --> 01:03:39,854
we cannot condone your acts.

570
01:03:39,993 --> 01:03:44,657
We only express the hope that your
experiences may not alone keep you,

571
01:03:44,797 --> 01:03:50,633
but thousands of others, from
the vicious pitfalls of marihuana.

572
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:54,604
Thus, l am ordering you to remain
in this court during the next case

573
01:03:54,741 --> 01:04:00,077
so that you will have to witness what
you yourself so narrowly escaped.

574
01:04:00,713 --> 01:04:03,773
Call the case of
the People v. Ralph Wiley.

575
01:04:08,521 --> 01:04:10,489
Bill.

576
01:04:11,524 --> 01:04:13,492
Bill.

577
01:04:31,311 --> 01:04:35,771
Your honor, the State waives trial
of the defendant, Ralph Wiley...

578
01:04:37,317 --> 01:04:40,616
...and recommends that he
be placed in an institution

579
01:04:40,753 --> 01:04:44,120
for the criminally insane
for the rest of his natural life.

580
01:04:44,257 --> 01:04:48,057
The defendant's counsel joins
the State in this request.

581
01:04:48,795 --> 01:04:53,926
Since counsel for the defense and
counsel for the state agree on this,

582
01:04:54,067 --> 01:04:57,127
l see no reason why the request
should not be granted.

583
01:04:59,138 --> 01:05:02,539
That happened right here,
to your neighbors.

584
01:05:02,675 --> 01:05:06,805
lt is not too much to say that in
your hands lies the possibility

585
01:05:06,946 --> 01:05:09,744
of averting other tragedies like it.

586
01:05:09,882 --> 01:05:15,252
We must work untiringly to oblige
our children to learn the truth,

587
01:05:15,388 --> 01:05:20,155
because it is only through knowledge
that we can safely protect them.

588
01:05:20,293 --> 01:05:25,356
Failing this, the next tragedy may be
that of your daughter,

589
01:05:25,498 --> 01:05:28,865
or your son, or yours,

590
01:05:29,002 --> 01:05:32,438
or yours...or yours.

591
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:45,000
