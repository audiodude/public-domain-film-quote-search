1
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,200
The name of our town is Grover's Corners,
New Hampshire.

2
00:01:54,224 --> 00:01:56,524
It's just across
the line from Massachusetts.

3
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,248
Latitude is 42 degrees, 40 minutes.

4
00:02:00,072 --> 00:02:02,072
Longitude is 70 degrees, 37 minutes.

5
00:02:03,296 --> 00:02:06,296
Running through the middle
of the town is Main Street.

6
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,220
Cutting across Main Street on the left
is the railroad tracks.

7
00:02:10,244 --> 00:02:12,244
Beyond the railroad tracks is Polish Town--

8
00:02:12,268 --> 00:02:16,168
you know, foreign folks who
come here to work in the mills--

9
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:19,292
a couple of Canuck families,
and the Catholic Church.

10
00:02:21,116 --> 00:02:23,240
You can see the steeple
on the Congregational Church.

11
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,140
The Presbyterian is just across the street.

12
00:02:26,164 --> 00:02:29,264
The Methodist and the
Unitarian are up a block.

13
00:02:29,288 --> 00:02:32,288
The Baptist Church is down
in the hollow...by the river.

14
00:02:34,212 --> 00:02:37,212
Next to the post office is the town hall.

15
00:02:37,236 --> 00:02:38,936
The jail's in the basement.

16
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,260
Bryan once made a speech
right on those very steps.

17
00:02:42,784 --> 00:02:44,784
It's a nice town, know what I mean?

18
00:02:44,808 --> 00:02:49,008
Nobody very wonderful ever come out of it,
so far as we know.

19
00:02:49,032 --> 00:02:51,232
The earliest dates on the tombstones

20
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:53,256
up there in the cemetery say 1670.

21
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,780
There're Grovers and Cartwrights

22
00:02:55,804 --> 00:02:57,804
and Gibbses and Herseys--

23
00:02:57,828 --> 00:03:01,428
same names as you find around here now.

24
00:03:01,452 --> 00:03:04,252
First, we'll show you a day in our town.

25
00:03:04,276 --> 00:03:07,276
Not as it is today in the year 1940,

26
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,200
but as it used to be in the year 1901.

27
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:12,224
All right, operator, let's start.

28
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:18,248
Yes, sir, that's the way our town looked
back in the year 1901.

29
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:22,272
Along Main Street, there's a row of stores
with hitchin' posts...

30
00:03:22,296 --> 00:03:24,396
and horse blocks in front of 'em.

31
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,220
The first automobile is gonna
come along in about five years.

32
00:03:28,244 --> 00:03:31,444
The date is June 7, 1901.

33
00:03:31,468 --> 00:03:33,968
It's just before dawn.

34
00:03:33,992 --> 00:03:37,292
Yeah, just about.

35
00:03:37,316 --> 00:03:41,216
The sky's already beginning...

36
00:03:41,216 --> 00:03:44,264
to show some streaks of light in it over
there in the east, back of our mountain.

37
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:48,264
The morning star gets wonderful bright
the moment before it has to go.

38
00:03:49,288 --> 00:03:52,288
The only lights on in the town are
a cottage over in Polish Town,

39
00:03:52,312 --> 00:03:54,312
where a mother's just
giving birth to twins,

40
00:03:54,336 --> 00:03:56,336
and down in the depot
where Shorty Hawkins...

41
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,660
is getting ready to flag
the 5:45 for Boston.

42
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:02,684
There she is now.

43
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:06,632
Of course, naturally, out
in the country all around,

44
00:04:06,632 --> 00:04:08,732
there've been lights on for some time,

45
00:04:08,756 --> 00:04:12,556
what with milkin' and so on,
but townfolk sleep late.

46
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,280
Here comes Joe Crowell,
delivering the morning papers.

47
00:04:18,304 --> 00:04:21,204
So...another day has begun.

48
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:26,228
Here comes Doc Gibbs from that baby case
I was tellin' you about.

49
00:04:27,252 --> 00:04:29,252
And this is Doc Gibbs' house.

50
00:04:29,276 --> 00:04:31,276
His neighbor's Editor Webb.

51
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,200
There's Mrs. Gibbs coming downstairs
to get breakfast.

52
00:04:36,224 --> 00:04:42,224
Later on, about 1910, she's going on to visit her daughter, Rebecca, in Canton, Ohio.

53
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:46,248
Mrs. Gibbs is going to die there...
pneumonia.

54
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:49,572
But she's going to be brought back here,
and she's going to be buried...

55
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:51,295
in the cemetery right here in our town...

56
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:54,296
with a whole mess of Gibbses and Herseys.

57
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,220
In our town, we like to know
the facts about everybody.

58
00:04:58,244 --> 00:05:02,244
And there's Mrs. Webb coming downstairs
to get her breakfast too.

59
00:05:04,068 --> 00:05:07,268
Mrs. Webb was a Grover before
she married Editor Webb.

60
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:08,492
Yeah.

61
00:05:09,316 --> 00:05:12,216
Children...children, time to get up!

62
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,240
George...Rebecca!

63
00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:16,264
Emily, time to get up!

64
00:05:16,288 --> 00:05:18,788
Wally...it's 7:00!

65
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:34,512
Mornin', Howie.

66
00:05:34,536 --> 00:05:35,736
Mornin', Mrs. Gibbs.

67
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,060
Looks like you're late today.

68
00:05:37,084 --> 00:05:38,684
Yes, somethin' wrong with the separator.

69
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,708
Don't know what it was.

70
00:05:45,332 --> 00:05:46,532
There ya be.

71
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:48,556
Thanks, Howie.

72
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,480
Mornin', Mrs. Webb.

73
00:05:57,504 --> 00:05:58,704
Mornin', Mr. Newsome.

74
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,028
Mighty fine day.

75
00:06:04,052 --> 00:06:06,052
Yeah.

76
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:10,576
How's Mrs. Newsome?

77
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,100
Good.

78
00:06:13,324 --> 00:06:15,324
Emily...Wally!

79
00:06:15,348 --> 00:06:17,648
George...Rebecca!

80
00:06:25,272 --> 00:06:26,772
Come on, get up.

81
00:06:28,296 --> 00:06:30,296
Bessie, come on.

82
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,320
What's the matter with you?

83
00:06:32,344 --> 00:06:34,044
Ah, they've quit taking milk,
now, come on!

84
00:06:34,068 --> 00:06:35,268
Mornin', Howie!

85
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:36,492
Mornin', Doc!

86
00:06:36,516 --> 00:06:38,516
Bessie acting up?

87
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,240
She's all mixed up about the route ever since the Lockhart's stopped takin' a quart of milk a day.

88
00:06:42,264 --> 00:06:44,264
She wants to leave 'em
a quart just the same.

89
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:46,288
Keeps pulling me the whole trip.

90
00:06:46,312 --> 00:06:47,812
Somebody sick?

91
00:06:47,836 --> 00:06:49,836
Twins over at Mrs. Gorislovsky's.

92
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,560
Twins, huh.
This town keeps gettin' bigger every year.

93
00:06:52,608 --> 00:06:53,608
Come on, now,
come on, Bessie.

94
00:06:53,632 --> 00:06:54,732
Mornin', Doc.

95
00:06:54,756 --> 00:06:55,856
Mornin', Joe.

96
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,280
Want your paper now?

97
00:06:57,304 --> 00:06:58,404
Yeah, I'll take it.

98
00:06:58,428 --> 00:06:59,628
Anybody been sick, Doc?

99
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:01,652
No, twins over in Polish Town.

100
00:07:01,676 --> 00:07:04,276
Joe, I see your teacher
Miss Foster's gonna get married.

101
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,200
Yes, sir, to a fella over in Concord.

102
00:07:06,224 --> 00:07:08,224
How do you boys feel about that?

103
00:07:08,248 --> 00:07:10,248
Well, of course,
it ain't none of my business,

104
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:12,672
but I think if a person
starts out to be a teacher,

105
00:07:12,696 --> 00:07:14,696
she oughta stay one.

106
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,720
How's the knee, Joe?

107
00:07:16,744 --> 00:07:17,944
Fine, Doc.

108
00:07:17,968 --> 00:07:19,168
Never think 'bout it at'll.

109
00:07:19,192 --> 00:07:20,392
Only like you said,

110
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,916
it always tells me when it's gonna rain.

111
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,440
What's it telling you today? Gonna rain?

112
00:07:23,464 --> 00:07:24,464
No, sir.

113
00:07:24,488 --> 00:07:25,688
- Sure?
- Yes, sir.

114
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,212
- Knee never makes mistakes?
- No, sir.

115
00:07:27,236 --> 00:07:28,836
- Doc.
- Joe.

116
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,760
<i>Want to tell you something
about that boy, Joe Crowell.<i>

117
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:36,184
<i>Joe was awful smart,
so he got a scholarship to Boston Tech.<i>

118
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:39,208
<i>Yes, gonna be a great engineer, Joe was.<i>

119
00:07:39,232 --> 00:07:44,032
<i>But...the war broke out...
and he died in France.<i>

120
00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:46,256
<i>All that education for nothing.<i>

121
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,380
- Everything all right, Frank?
- Yes.

122
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,004
I declare, easy as kittens.

123
00:07:53,028 --> 00:07:54,528
Children, hurry up!

124
00:07:54,552 --> 00:07:56,552
George...Rebecca!

125
00:07:57,676 --> 00:07:59,276
Bacon'll be ready in a moment.

126
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,900
Sit down and drink your coffee.

127
00:08:02,124 --> 00:08:03,824
You can catch a couple of hours
sleep this morning, won't ya?

128
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:05,848
Mrs. Wentworth's comin' at 11:00.

129
00:08:05,872 --> 00:08:07,872
Guess I know what that's about too.

130
00:08:08,296 --> 00:08:10,296
Her stomach ain't what it ought to be.

131
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,620
All told, you won't get more
than three hours sleep.

132
00:08:12,644 --> 00:08:14,644
Frank Gibbs, I don't know
what's gonna become of you.

133
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:16,668
I think we should go away some place
and take a rest.

134
00:08:16,692 --> 00:08:18,692
It'd do you good.

135
00:08:24,216 --> 00:08:25,916
Children, hurry now!

136
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,640
Emily...Wally!

137
00:08:29,364 --> 00:08:30,964
You'll have to speak to George.

138
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:32,488
Seems like something's
come over him lately.

139
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,012
He's no help to me at all.

140
00:08:34,036 --> 00:08:35,536
Can't even get him to cut some wood.

141
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,060
Is he sassy to you?

142
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:38,284
Just whines.

143
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:40,108
All he thinks about is that old baseball.

144
00:08:40,132 --> 00:08:42,132
George...Rebecca,
you'll be late for school!

145
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:43,656
George!

146
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,880
George, look sharp!

147
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:45,904
<i>Yes, Pa.<i>

148
00:08:45,928 --> 00:08:47,428
Don't you hear your mother calling you?

149
00:08:47,452 --> 00:08:49,452
Guess I'll go upstairs and catch 40 winks.

150
00:08:49,476 --> 00:08:51,776
Ma...Ma, what dress shall I wear?

151
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,200
<i>I washed and ironed
the blue gingham for you special.<i>

152
00:08:54,224 --> 00:08:56,924
Oh, Ma, I hate that dress!

153
00:08:59,348 --> 00:09:03,148
<i>Every day, I go to school
dressed like a sick turkey!<i>

154
00:09:03,472 --> 00:09:06,172
<i>Oh, Rebecca, you always look very nice.<i>

155
00:09:10,296 --> 00:09:12,296
Ma, George is throwing soap at me!

156
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,220
<i>I'll come up and slap the both of ya,
that's what I'll do!<i>

157
00:09:16,544 --> 00:09:20,044
Hurry up, children, it's after 7:00,
and I don't want to call you again!

158
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:29,468
Ma.

159
00:09:29,492 --> 00:09:31,492
Mornin', children.

160
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,416
Children, I won't have it!

161
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
Breakfast's as good as any meal.

162
00:09:37,464 --> 00:09:38,964
I won't have you gobbling like wolves.

163
00:09:38,988 --> 00:09:40,488
It'll stunt your growth.

164
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:42,012
Wally, put your book away.

165
00:09:42,036 --> 00:09:44,236
Ma, by 10:00,
I gotta know all about Canada.

166
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,260
You know the rules as well as I do.

167
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:47,784
No books at table.

168
00:09:47,808 --> 00:09:50,608
As for me, I'd rather have my children
healthy than bright.

169
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,632
I'm both, Mama, you know I am.

170
00:09:52,656 --> 00:09:54,656
I'm the brightest girl
in school for my age.

171
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,680
I have a wonderful memory.

172
00:09:56,704 --> 00:09:58,704
Eat your breakfast.

173
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:01,428
I'll speak to your father when he's rested.

174
00:10:01,452 --> 00:10:04,052
It'd seem 25 cents a week's
enough for a boy your age.

175
00:10:04,076 --> 00:10:06,076
I don't know how you spend it all.

176
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,100
Oh, Ma, I got a lot of things to buy.

177
00:10:08,124 --> 00:10:11,024
Strawberry frosties,
that's what you spend it on.

178
00:10:11,248 --> 00:10:13,548
I don't see how Rebecca
comes to have so much money.

179
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,172
She's got more than a dollar.

180
00:10:15,196 --> 00:10:17,196
I've been savin' it up.

181
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,220
It's good to spend some now and then.

182
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:22,244
Ma, do you know
what I like most in the world?

183
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:23,268
Do ya?

184
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:24,592
Money.

185
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:26,616
Eat your breakfast.

186
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,240
There's the first bell!
I gotta go!

187
00:10:37,064 --> 00:10:39,064
Hurry up, Wally!

188
00:10:40,388 --> 00:10:42,388
Bye, Mama.

189
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,212
Now, walk fast, you don't have to run!

190
00:10:48,936 --> 00:10:50,636
Wally, pull up your pants at the knees!

191
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,160
Rebecca, give Miss Foster
my best congratulations!

192
00:10:53,184 --> 00:10:54,684
Can you remember that?

193
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,208
Rebecca...pick up your feet.

194
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:09,232
Here, chick...chick...chick...

195
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:15,356
Where did you come from?
You don't belong to me.

196
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,080
What ya scared of, nobody's gonna hurt ya.

197
00:11:19,004 --> 00:11:20,404
Mornin', Julia.

198
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:21,852
Mornin', Myrtle.
How's your cold?

199
00:11:21,852 --> 00:11:23,652
Oh, still got that ticklin'
feeling in my throat.

200
00:11:23,652 --> 00:11:26,700
Told Charles I didn't know as I'd go
to choir rehearsal tonight.

201
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,500
Ever try singin' over your voice?

202
00:11:28,524 --> 00:11:30,524
Yes, but somehow I can't do that
and stay on key.

203
00:11:30,548 --> 00:11:32,548
Beans have been good this year.
Let me help ya.

204
00:11:33,272 --> 00:11:35,572
I decided to put up
40 quarts if it kills me.

205
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,296
Children say they hate 'em,
but they manage to get 'em down all winter.

206
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,320
Myrtle, I got to tell ya somethin'.
If I don't tell somebody, I'll burst.

207
00:11:43,344 --> 00:11:44,444
Why, Julia Gibbs.

208
00:11:44,468 --> 00:11:48,268
One of those secondhand furniture men
from Boston came to see me last Friday.

209
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:50,492
First I thought it was a patient
waitin' to see Dr. Gibbs,

210
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:52,992
but he wormed his way right into my parlor.

211
00:11:53,016 --> 00:11:57,116
Myrtle Webb, he offered me $350 for Grandmother Hersey's highboy as I'm sittin' here.

212
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,240
Well, you're gonna take it, aren't ya?

213
00:11:59,664 --> 00:12:00,764
I don't know.

214
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:02,188
You don't know...?
$350!

215
00:12:02,212 --> 00:12:03,712
What's come over you?

216
00:12:04,336 --> 00:12:06,636
Well, if I could get the doctor
to take the money...

217
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,260
and go away on a trip,
I'd sell it like that.

218
00:12:09,284 --> 00:12:12,784
You know, it's always been a dream
of my life to see Paris, France.

219
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,208
Crazy, I suppose.

220
00:12:17,232 --> 00:12:19,532
For years, I've been promisin' myself
if we ever had the chance...

221
00:12:19,556 --> 00:12:20,956
How does the doctor feel about it?

222
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,080
Well I did beat about the bush a little.

223
00:12:24,104 --> 00:12:26,604
Said if I ever got a legacy
--that's the way I put it--

224
00:12:27,128 --> 00:12:28,328
I'd make him take me.

225
00:12:28,352 --> 00:12:29,452
What'd he say?

226
00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:30,476
You know how he is.

227
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,000
Haven't heard a serious word
out of him since I've known him.

228
00:12:33,024 --> 00:12:34,524
"No", he says.

229
00:12:34,548 --> 00:12:38,048
"Might make him discontented with Grover's
Corners to go traipsing over to Europe.

230
00:12:38,072 --> 00:12:40,272
"No, let well enough alone," he said.

231
00:12:40,296 --> 00:12:44,096
Well if that secondhand man's real serious
about buying it, you sell it, Julia.

232
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,420
You'll get to see Paris.

233
00:12:46,444 --> 00:12:48,444
Just drop a hint from time to time.

234
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,968
That's how I got Mr. Webb to take me
to see the Atlantic Ocean, you know.

235
00:12:50,992 --> 00:12:52,492
I'm sorry I mentioned it.

236
00:12:52,516 --> 00:12:55,216
It seems to me once
in your life before you die,

237
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,640
you oughta see a country
where they don't speak in English...

238
00:12:57,664 --> 00:12:59,664
and don't even wanna.

239
00:12:59,688 --> 00:13:01,688
<i>That'll do, ladies, thank you very much.<i>

240
00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:03,912
<i>Now, we'll skip a few hours.<i>

241
00:13:11,636 --> 00:13:15,236
Now, before we get on, I think we oughta have a little more information about the town.

242
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,260
A kind of a scientific account,
you might say.

243
00:13:18,284 --> 00:13:21,284
So I've invited Professor Willard
of our state university...

244
00:13:21,308 --> 00:13:26,308
to come here and try to sketch
in a few details of our past history.

245
00:13:32,232 --> 00:13:34,232
There he is now.

246
00:13:34,256 --> 00:13:35,656
Am I late?

247
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,680
Right on time.

248
00:13:37,704 --> 00:13:41,104
May I introduce Professor Willard
of our state university?

249
00:13:42,128 --> 00:13:44,128
Just a few brief words, Professor.

250
00:13:44,152 --> 00:13:45,952
Unfortunately, our time is limited.

251
00:13:45,976 --> 00:13:48,276
Yes, let me see.

252
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,100
Grover's Corners.

253
00:13:51,524 --> 00:13:55,524
Grover's Corners lies on the old Pliocene
granite of the Appalachian Range.

254
00:13:55,548 --> 00:13:58,548
I might say that's some of
the oldest land in the world.

255
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:00,772
We're very proud of that around here.

256
00:14:01,296 --> 00:14:04,296
Some highly interesting
fossils have been found.

257
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,020
I might say unique fossils,
two miles north of town...

258
00:14:08,044 --> 00:14:10,844
in Silas Peckham's cow pasture.

259
00:14:10,868 --> 00:14:14,868
These may be seen in the museum
of the university at any time.

260
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:17,792
Well, that is, at any reasonable time.

261
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:22,216
Shall I tell 'em about the meteorological
conditions, the mean precipitation, etc.?

262
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,240
I'm afraid we won't have time for that,
Professor.

263
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:28,064
We might have a few words about
the history of man here, though.

264
00:14:28,088 --> 00:14:30,788
- Oh, anthropological data.
- Yes.

265
00:14:30,812 --> 00:14:32,312
Let's see.

266
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:35,136
Early Amerindian stock,
Cotahatchie tribes.

267
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,160
No evidences before
the tenth century of this era.

268
00:14:38,184 --> 00:14:40,684
Now entirely disappeared.

269
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:44,208
Oh, possible traces in three families.

270
00:14:44,232 --> 00:14:48,232
Migration in the early 17th century of
English brachycephalic, blue-eyed stock,

271
00:14:48,256 --> 00:14:53,256
and since then,
some Slav and Mediterranean...

272
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,280
And the population, Professor.

273
00:14:55,304 --> 00:15:00,304
Within the town limits, 2640.
The po...

274
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:04,528
Oh, is that so.

275
00:15:04,552 --> 00:15:08,052
In that case,
the population at the moment is 2642.

276
00:15:08,076 --> 00:15:14,276
The postal districts bring in 507 more,
making a total of 3149.

277
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,200
Mortality, birth rates--constant.

278
00:15:17,224 --> 00:15:21,624
By McPherson's gauge, 6.32.

279
00:15:21,648 --> 00:15:23,248
Thank you very much, Professor.

280
00:15:23,272 --> 00:15:25,572
I'm sure we're all
very much obliged to you.

281
00:15:25,596 --> 00:15:27,296
Not at all, sir.
Not at all.

282
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,320
Good day.

283
00:15:31,544 --> 00:15:34,544
And now, the social and political report.

284
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,568
Oh, Editor Webb.

285
00:15:36,592 --> 00:15:37,792
<i>Mr. Webb.<i>

286
00:15:38,216 --> 00:15:41,216
Charlie Webb's the father
of Wally and Emily.

287
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,240
Emily's the smart girl
with the good memory.

288
00:15:44,264 --> 00:15:46,764
You know, you saw her at breakfast.

289
00:15:47,288 --> 00:15:49,988
Alright, Editor Webb, it's your turn now.

290
00:15:50,012 --> 00:15:52,012
Well, I don't have to tell ya...

291
00:15:52,012 --> 00:15:54,312
that we're run here
by a board of select men.

292
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:57,136
All males vote at the age of 21.

293
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,660
Women vote indirect.

294
00:15:58,684 --> 00:16:04,284
Politically, we're 86% republican,
12% democrat, 4% socialist...

295
00:16:04,308 --> 00:16:06,308
the rest indifferent.

296
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:12,732
Religiously, we're 85% Protestants,
12% Catholics...the rest indifferent.

297
00:16:14,356 --> 00:16:16,556
Very ordinary town, if you ask me,

298
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,280
but our young people here
seem to like it well enough.

299
00:16:19,304 --> 00:16:23,204
Lots of 'em settle down right here to live,
even after they've been away to college.

300
00:16:24,628 --> 00:16:27,228
Now, is there anybody in the audience
who'd like to ask...

301
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,752
Editor Webb any questions about our town?

302
00:16:31,276 --> 00:16:34,776
<i>Is there much drinkin'
in Grover's Corners?<i>

303
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Well, ma'am,
I wouldn't know what you'd call much.

304
00:16:38,224 --> 00:16:40,724
Saturday nights, the farmhands meet down...

305
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:43,248
at Edward's stable and holler some.

306
00:16:43,272 --> 00:16:47,072
We got one or two town drunks,
but they're always having remorses...

307
00:16:47,096 --> 00:16:49,296
every time an evangelist comes to town.

308
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,120
No, I'd say that liquor wasn't
a regular thing in a home here,

309
00:16:53,144 --> 00:16:55,244
except in the medicine chest.

310
00:16:55,268 --> 00:16:58,568
Probably good for snake bites, you know.
Always was.

311
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:02,592
<i>Mr. Webb.<i>

312
00:17:02,616 --> 00:17:03,816
Yes.

313
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:09,340
<i>Is there any culture or
love of beauty in Grover's Corners?<i>

314
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:14,264
Well, no, ma'am, not much, that is,
in the sense you mean.

315
00:17:14,288 --> 00:17:17,288
There are some girls that play the piano
at the high school commencement,

316
00:17:17,312 --> 00:17:19,812
but they ain't happy about it.

317
00:17:21,036 --> 00:17:23,236
No, there ain't much culture.

318
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,060
Robinson Crusoe and the Bible
and Händel's Largo--

319
00:17:26,084 --> 00:17:29,284
we all know that--
and Whistler's Mother.

320
00:17:29,308 --> 00:17:31,308
That's about as far as we go.

321
00:17:31,332 --> 00:17:32,832
<i>Thank you very much, Mr. Webb.<i>

322
00:17:34,156 --> 00:17:35,856
<i>Is there no one in town...<i>

323
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,680
I'm sorry, but we haven't time
for any more questions.

324
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:40,704
We must be getting on with the picture.

325
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,628
<i>It's getting on in the afternoon.<i>

326
00:17:43,652 --> 00:17:46,252
<i>All 2642 have had their dinners.<i>

327
00:17:46,276 --> 00:17:48,276
<i>All the dishes have been washed.<i>

328
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,900
<i>There's an early afternoon
calm about the town.<i>

329
00:17:52,224 --> 00:17:55,024
<i>Charlie Webb's going home to mow his lawn.<i>

330
00:17:55,048 --> 00:17:59,248
<i>One man in ten thinks it's a privilige
to push his own lawn mower.<i>

331
00:17:59,272 --> 00:18:02,272
<i>The afternoon session of school is over.<i>

332
00:18:03,296 --> 00:18:05,296
<i>Doc Gibbs is in his office
tappin' people...<i>

333
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,120
<i>and making 'em say, "Ahhh."<i>

334
00:18:07,144 --> 00:18:09,144
Ahhh.

335
00:18:13,068 --> 00:18:16,868
<i>I have to go home and
help my mother, I promised.<i>

336
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:19,992
Emily, walk simply.

337
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,516
Who do you think you are today?

338
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,540
Papa, you're terrible.

339
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,864
One minute, you tell me to
stand up straight,

340
00:18:28,888 --> 00:18:31,088
and the next minute, you call me names.

341
00:18:31,212 --> 00:18:33,712
I just don't listen to you.

342
00:18:35,036 --> 00:18:38,536
Golly, never got a kiss
from such a great lady before!

343
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,160
Hello, Emily.

344
00:18:42,184 --> 00:18:44,184
Oh, hello.

345
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:49,308
You made a fine speech in class today.

346
00:18:49,332 --> 00:18:53,432
Well, I was really ready to make a speech
on the Monroe Doctrine,

347
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:57,056
but at the last minute,
Miss Foster made me talk...

348
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,680
about the Louisiana Purchase instead.

349
00:19:00,204 --> 00:19:02,704
I worked an awful long time
on both of them.

350
00:19:03,228 --> 00:19:05,228
Gee, it's funny, Emily.

351
00:19:05,252 --> 00:19:08,252
From my window up there,
I can see your head nights...

352
00:19:08,276 --> 00:19:11,476
when you're doin' your homework
over in your room.

353
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,100
Why, can you?

354
00:19:14,224 --> 00:19:17,224
You certainly do stick to it, Emily.

355
00:19:17,248 --> 00:19:20,248
I don't see how you
can sit still that long.

356
00:19:20,272 --> 00:19:22,272
I guess you must like school.

357
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:27,896
Well, I feel it's just something
you have to go through.

358
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,220
What do you think, Emily?

359
00:19:30,244 --> 00:19:33,244
We might work out a kind of telegraph
from your window to mine,

360
00:19:33,268 --> 00:19:38,068
and you could give me a hint every once in
a while on one of those algebra problems.

361
00:19:38,092 --> 00:19:39,192
Well...

362
00:19:39,216 --> 00:19:42,216
Well, I don't mean the answers, Emily.
Of course not.

363
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,240
I mean, just some little hint.

364
00:19:45,764 --> 00:19:47,764
Well, I think hints are allowed,

365
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:53,188
so if you get stuck, George,
just whistle to me,

366
00:19:53,212 --> 00:19:55,712
and I'll give you some hints.

367
00:19:56,236 --> 00:20:01,236
Gosh...you're just naturally bright,
I guess.

368
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:06,860
Well...I figure it's just
the way a person's born.

369
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:12,084
Yeah...but you see,
I want to be a farmer.

370
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:16,108
My Uncle Luke says that whenever I'm ready,

371
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,132
I can come over and work on his farm.

372
00:20:18,156 --> 00:20:22,256
If I'm any good at all,
I can just gradually have it.

373
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,980
You mean, the house and everything?

374
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:26,504
Yeah.

375
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:34,828
Well, I guess I better be gettin' off
to the baseball field.

376
00:20:34,852 --> 00:20:37,352
Thanks for the talk, Emily.

377
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:39,476
Afternoon, Mrs. Webb.

378
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,800
Hi, George.

379
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,124
So long, Emily.

380
00:20:42,148 --> 00:20:43,448
So long, George.

381
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,172
<i>Emily, what ya doing?<i>

382
00:21:24,196 --> 00:21:26,196
Nothing, Mama.

383
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,220
If you're doing nothing, you can come in
here and help me with this yarn.

384
00:21:40,944 --> 00:21:44,744
Well, George Gibbs let himself have
a real conversation, didn't he?

385
00:21:44,768 --> 00:21:46,968
He's growin' up.

386
00:21:46,992 --> 00:21:49,192
How old would George be?

387
00:21:49,216 --> 00:21:50,716
Oh, I don't know.

388
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,040
Let's see, he must be around 17.

389
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:57,764
Mama, I made a speech in class today.
I was very good.

390
00:21:57,788 --> 00:22:00,088
You must recite it
to your father at supper.

391
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:01,412
What was it about?

392
00:22:01,436 --> 00:22:03,636
The Louisiana Purchase.

393
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,060
It was like silk off a spool.

394
00:22:07,084 --> 00:22:09,384
I'm going to make speeches all my life.

395
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,908
You're holding it too tight, Emily.

396
00:22:11,632 --> 00:22:13,632
There, that's better.

397
00:22:13,956 --> 00:22:16,256
- Mama?
- Huh?

398
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,780
Will you answer me a question, serious?

399
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:21,204
Seriously, dear, not serious.

400
00:22:21,228 --> 00:22:23,228
Seriously, will you?

401
00:22:23,252 --> 00:22:24,752
Of course I will.

402
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:29,576
Mama...am I good-looking?

403
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,700
Of course you are.

404
00:22:31,124 --> 00:22:33,124
Both of my children
have gotten good features.

405
00:22:33,148 --> 00:22:35,148
It'd be a shame if they hadn't.

406
00:22:35,172 --> 00:22:37,172
Oh, Mama, that's not what I mean.

407
00:22:37,196 --> 00:22:40,696
What I mean is...am I pretty?

408
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,820
I've already told you yes!

409
00:22:43,844 --> 00:22:45,244
Now, that's enough of that!

410
00:22:45,468 --> 00:22:47,668
You've got a nice young, pretty face.

411
00:22:47,692 --> 00:22:49,692
Never heard such foolishness.

412
00:22:49,716 --> 00:22:52,316
Oh, Mama, you never tell us
the truth about anything.

413
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,640
I am telling you the truth!

414
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,664
Mama, were you pretty?

415
00:22:57,688 --> 00:22:59,688
Yes, I was, if I do say it.

416
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:03,612
I was the prettiest girl in town
next to Mamie Cartwright.

417
00:23:03,636 --> 00:23:06,636
Oh, but Mama,
you've got to say something about me.

418
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,660
Am I pretty enough to get anybody...

419
00:23:10,684 --> 00:23:14,284
well, to get people interested in me?

420
00:23:14,608 --> 00:23:16,608
Emily, you make me tired!
Now, stop it!

421
00:23:16,632 --> 00:23:20,132
You're pretty enough
for all normal purposes!

422
00:23:25,456 --> 00:23:26,756
It's evening.

423
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,480
You can hear the choir practicing
in the Congregational Church.

424
00:23:30,504 --> 00:23:34,504
The children are all home
doing their schoolwork.

425
00:23:36,528 --> 00:23:39,528
The day is running down like a tired clock.

426
00:24:50,952 --> 00:24:53,852
Alright...that's better,

427
00:24:53,876 --> 00:24:56,676
which ain't no miracle.

428
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,700
Now, do it again.

429
00:25:00,824 --> 00:25:07,424
Remember, ladies...music come into
the world to give pleasure.

430
00:25:10,048 --> 00:25:12,448
Now, try it again.

431
00:25:21,072 --> 00:25:23,072
Softly.

432
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,296
Softer!

433
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,220
Now, listen, everybody.

434
00:25:34,244 --> 00:25:39,744
Get it out of your minds that
music's only good when it's loud.

435
00:25:41,868 --> 00:25:44,868
You leave loudness to the Methodists.

436
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:50,792
You couldn't beat 'em,
even if you wanted to.

437
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,216
Once again, now...

438
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,340
"Art thou weary,
art thou languid?"

439
00:25:59,264 --> 00:26:05,564
It's a question, ladies and gentlemen...
make it talk.

440
00:26:05,888 --> 00:26:12,888
Oh, and remember, on Sunday,
take the second verse real soft.

441
00:26:14,812 --> 00:26:17,812
Sort of die out at the end.

442
00:26:19,836 --> 00:26:21,836
Ready?

443
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,360
Psst...Emily.

444
00:26:39,884 --> 00:26:42,884
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

445
00:26:44,808 --> 00:26:47,308
I can't work at all.

446
00:26:47,332 --> 00:26:50,232
The moonlight's so terrible.

447
00:26:55,356 --> 00:26:58,056
Emily, did you get the third problem?

448
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880
- Which?
- The third.

449
00:27:04,404 --> 00:27:08,404
Oh, yes, George,
that's the easiest of them all.

450
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,828
I don't see it.

451
00:27:12,852 --> 00:27:16,152
Emily, could you give me a hint?

452
00:27:20,176 --> 00:27:22,876
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

453
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,200
The answer's in yards.

454
00:27:27,824 --> 00:27:29,824
In yards?

455
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,848
What do you mean?

456
00:27:31,872 --> 00:27:33,872
Square yards.

457
00:27:33,896 --> 00:27:36,396
Oh, square yards.

458
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,320
Yes, George, don't you see?

459
00:27:41,044 --> 00:27:42,544
Yeah.

460
00:27:44,268 --> 00:27:46,268
Square yards of wallpaper!

461
00:27:48,692 --> 00:27:51,992
Oh, I see.
Square yards of wallpaper.

462
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:56,816
- Thanks a lot, Emily.
- You're welcome.

463
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,240
My...isn't the moonlight terrible?

464
00:28:10,864 --> 00:28:12,864
I think if you hold your breath,

465
00:28:12,888 --> 00:28:15,888
you can hear the train
all the way to Contoocook.

466
00:28:23,412 --> 00:28:25,412
Hear it?

467
00:28:25,836 --> 00:28:27,836
Yeah, what do you know.

468
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,360
Well...I guess I'd better
get back now and try to work.

469
00:28:36,384 --> 00:28:37,884
Good night, Emily.

470
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,808
Good night, George.

471
00:28:44,332 --> 00:28:47,032
<i>Oh, George, can you come down a minute?<i>

472
00:28:47,056 --> 00:28:49,056
Yes, Pa.

473
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
Make yourself comfortable, George.

474
00:28:57,004 --> 00:28:59,004
I'll only keep you a minute.

475
00:29:02,028 --> 00:29:05,828
- George, how old are you?
- Me?

476
00:29:05,852 --> 00:29:07,852
I'm past 17.

477
00:29:08,876 --> 00:29:12,076
What do you want to do after school's over?

478
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,500
You know, Pa, I want to be a farmer
on Uncle Luke's farm.

479
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:23,024
And you'll be willing, will you, to get up
early and milk and feed the stock?

480
00:29:23,048 --> 00:29:26,048
And you'll be able to hoe and hay all day?

481
00:29:27,072 --> 00:29:29,072
Sure, I will.

482
00:29:29,096 --> 00:29:31,096
What do you mean, Pa?

483
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:38,120
Well, George, when I was here in the office
today, I heard a funny sound.

484
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:40,744
What do you think it was?

485
00:29:41,068 --> 00:29:43,768
It was your mother chopping wood.

486
00:29:46,092 --> 00:29:50,092
Now, there you see
your mother getting up early,

487
00:29:50,116 --> 00:29:53,016
cooking meals all day,
washing and ironing,

488
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,040
and yet she has to go out
in the backyard and chop wood.

489
00:29:58,064 --> 00:30:00,864
I suppose she got tired of asking you.

490
00:30:00,888 --> 00:30:05,888
I suppose she just gave up and decided
it was easier to do it herself.

491
00:30:07,912 --> 00:30:10,912
Yet, you eat her meals.

492
00:30:11,036 --> 00:30:14,036
You put on the clothes
she keeps nice for ya.

493
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,060
Then you run out and play baseball...

494
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:23,084
like she was a hired girl
we kept around the house...

495
00:30:23,108 --> 00:30:25,108
but didn't like very much.

496
00:30:28,032 --> 00:30:31,532
I knew all I had to do was
call it to your attention.

497
00:30:36,056 --> 00:30:38,056
Here's a handkerchief, son.

498
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,580
Wonder what's happened to your mother?

499
00:30:49,004 --> 00:30:52,004
Choir practice never was
as late as this before.

500
00:30:53,028 --> 00:30:55,428
It's only half past eight, Pa.

501
00:30:57,052 --> 00:30:59,052
I don't know what she wants
in that choir anyway.

502
00:30:59,076 --> 00:31:02,376
She hasn't got any more voice
than an old crow.

503
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,300
Traipsing around the street
at this hour of the night.

504
00:31:13,024 --> 00:31:16,324
Just about time you retired,
don't you think, George?

505
00:31:18,048 --> 00:31:20,048
Yes, Pa.

506
00:31:42,072 --> 00:31:44,072
<i>My, it's late.<i>

507
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:47,096
<i>A real nice choir practice, wasn't it?<i>

508
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,120
<i>Myrtle Webb, look at that moon.<i>

509
00:31:49,944 --> 00:31:51,944
Potato weather, sure.

510
00:31:52,068 --> 00:31:55,068
Well, naturally I didn't want to
say a word about it...

511
00:31:55,092 --> 00:31:58,092
in front of those others,
but now we're alone,

512
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:01,316
really it's the worst scandal
that ever was in this town.

513
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,340
- What?
- Why, Simon Stimson.

514
00:32:03,364 --> 00:32:04,364
Now, Louella.

515
00:32:04,388 --> 00:32:09,488
But Julia, to have the organist at
a church drink and drink year after year.

516
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:10,512
Louella!

517
00:32:10,536 --> 00:32:12,536
Julia, you know he was drunk tonight.

518
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,060
Now, Louella,
we all know about Mr. Stimson.

519
00:32:15,084 --> 00:32:17,184
We all know about
the trouble he's been through.

520
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:19,208
And Dr. Ferguson knows.

521
00:32:19,232 --> 00:32:21,232
If Dr. Ferguson's willing to
keep him on his job,

522
00:32:21,256 --> 00:32:24,656
the only thing the rest of us
can do is not notice it.

523
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,180
Not to notice it?

524
00:32:26,204 --> 00:32:27,504
But it's getting worse.

525
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,328
No, it ain't, Louella, it's getting better.

526
00:32:29,352 --> 00:32:31,952
I've been in that choir
twice as long as you have,

527
00:32:31,976 --> 00:32:34,076
and it doesn't happen
anywhere near so often.

528
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Oh, my...
I hate to go to bed on a night like this.

529
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:41,524
- Well...good night, Louella.
- Good night.

530
00:32:41,548 --> 00:32:43,948
- Night, Julia.
- Night, Myrtle.

531
00:32:45,072 --> 00:32:46,672
Can you get home all right, Louella?

532
00:32:46,696 --> 00:32:48,696
Oh, it's as bright as day.

533
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,220
I can see Mr. Soames
scowling at the window now.

534
00:32:54,044 --> 00:32:57,744
You'd think we'd been to a dance
the way the menfolk carry on.

535
00:32:58,068 --> 00:33:00,068
- Good night, Julia.
- Good night, Louella.

536
00:33:00,092 --> 00:33:02,692
- See you on Sunday.
- See you then.

537
00:33:08,016 --> 00:33:10,016
Well, we had a real good time.

538
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,540
You're late enough.

539
00:33:11,564 --> 00:33:13,964
Frank, I'm not any later than usual.

540
00:33:18,088 --> 00:33:21,088
You stopping to gossip with a lot of hens.

541
00:33:21,112 --> 00:33:23,112
Now, don't be grouchy.

542
00:33:26,036 --> 00:33:27,836
Smell my heliotrope.

543
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,660
What'd you do all the time I was away?

544
00:33:33,684 --> 00:33:36,084
Oh, I read as usual.

545
00:33:37,008 --> 00:33:39,708
Well...
what did the girls gossip about tonight?

546
00:33:39,732 --> 00:33:42,032
Believe me, Frank,
there's something to gossip about.

547
00:33:42,056 --> 00:33:44,456
Simon Stimson?
Far gone was he?

548
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,080
The worst I've ever seen.

549
00:33:46,104 --> 00:33:48,104
Frank, how's all that going to end?

550
00:33:48,128 --> 00:33:50,028
Dr. Ferguson can't forgive him forever.

551
00:33:50,052 --> 00:33:54,052
I guess I know Simon as well as
anybody in this town.

552
00:33:54,076 --> 00:33:57,976
Some people just ain't made
for small-town life.

553
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I don't know how that'll end, but there's
nothing we can do but leave it alone.

554
00:34:04,024 --> 00:34:06,024
- Get in.
- Oh, no, not yet.

555
00:34:06,548 --> 00:34:08,548
Frank, I'm worried about you.

556
00:34:08,572 --> 00:34:10,272
What are you worried about?

557
00:34:10,296 --> 00:34:13,096
Well, I think it's my duty to plan for you

558
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,120
to get a real rest and change.

559
00:34:15,144 --> 00:34:18,044
If I get that legacy,
I'm gonna insist upon it.

560
00:34:18,068 --> 00:34:21,968
Now, now, Julie, there's no sense
in going all over that again.

561
00:34:21,992 --> 00:34:24,092
Come on, it's getting late.

562
00:34:25,016 --> 00:34:27,816
First thing you know,
you'll catch a cold.

563
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,040
I gave George a piece of my mind tonight.

564
00:34:30,064 --> 00:34:32,864
I reckon you'll get your wood chopped...

565
00:34:32,888 --> 00:34:34,888
for a little while anyway.

566
00:34:35,012 --> 00:34:37,612
You know, that Mrs. Fairchild always
locks her front door every night.

567
00:34:37,636 --> 00:34:39,636
All of them out in that part of town do.

568
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,660
They're all getting too citified.

569
00:34:41,684 --> 00:34:43,684
That's the trouble with them.

570
00:34:45,008 --> 00:34:48,508
They haven't got a thing fit to burgle,
and everybody knows it.

571
00:34:52,332 --> 00:34:54,332
Good evening, Constable.

572
00:34:54,356 --> 00:34:56,356
Good evening, Mr. Webb.

573
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,880
- Quite a moon.
- Yeah.

574
00:35:00,904 --> 00:35:02,904
All quiet tonight?

575
00:35:02,928 --> 00:35:04,928
Simon Stimson is roaming around a little.

576
00:35:04,952 --> 00:35:07,452
I just saw his wife
moving out to hunt for him,

577
00:35:07,476 --> 00:35:09,976
so I looked the other way.

578
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
There he is now.

579
00:35:32,024 --> 00:35:34,024
Good evenin', Simon.

580
00:35:38,048 --> 00:35:40,048
Good evenin'.

581
00:35:40,072 --> 00:35:43,072
Most of the town's
settled down for the evening.

582
00:35:43,596 --> 00:35:46,196
Guess we'd better do the same.

583
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,720
Can I walk along with you?

584
00:35:57,344 --> 00:35:58,844
Good night.

585
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,568
I don't know how that's gonna end.

586
00:36:13,592 --> 00:36:15,592
Oh, Bill, if you see
my boy smokin' cigarettes,

587
00:36:15,616 --> 00:36:17,616
give a word to him, will ya?

588
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,640
He thinks a lot of you, Bill.

589
00:36:19,664 --> 00:36:22,564
I don't think
he smokes no cigarettes, Mr. Webb.

590
00:36:22,588 --> 00:36:25,588
At least ways,
not more than two or three a year.

591
00:36:25,612 --> 00:36:27,612
Well, I hope not.

592
00:36:27,636 --> 00:36:30,136
- Good night, Bill.
- Night, Mr. Webb.

593
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,060
Who's that up there?

594
00:36:56,084 --> 00:36:58,084
Is that you, Myrtle?

595
00:36:58,108 --> 00:37:00,108
Oh, no, it's me, Papa.

596
00:37:00,132 --> 00:37:02,132
Why aren't you in bed?

597
00:37:03,256 --> 00:37:05,256
I don't know.

598
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,180
I just can't sleep yet, Papa.

599
00:37:11,304 --> 00:37:13,804
The moonlight's so wonderful...

600
00:37:15,528 --> 00:37:19,228
and...the smell of Mrs. Gibbs' heliotrope.

601
00:37:21,352 --> 00:37:23,352
Can you smell it?

602
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:27,276
Ummm...yes.

603
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,300
Haven't any troubles on your mind
have ya, Emily?

604
00:37:30,324 --> 00:37:32,324
Troubles, Papa, no.

605
00:37:32,348 --> 00:37:35,148
Well, don't let your mother catch ya.

606
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:37,172
Good night, Emily.

607
00:37:37,396 --> 00:37:39,396
Night, Papa.

608
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,620
I never told ya about that
letter Jane Crawford got...

609
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:51,644
from her minister when she was sick.

610
00:37:51,668 --> 00:37:56,568
He wrote Jane a letter, and on the
envelope, the address was like this.

611
00:37:56,592 --> 00:38:02,592
It said, "Jane Crawford,
The Crawford Farm, Grover's Corners,

612
00:38:02,616 --> 00:38:08,516
Sutton County, New Hampshire,
The United States of America"...

613
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,040
What's funny about that?

614
00:38:10,064 --> 00:38:11,864
But listen, it's not finished!

615
00:38:12,188 --> 00:38:17,388
"The United States of America,
Continent of North America,

616
00:38:17,412 --> 00:38:26,412
Western Hemisphere, The Earth, The Solar
System, The Universe, The Mind of God."

617
00:38:26,436 --> 00:38:28,536
That's what it said on the envelope.

618
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,160
Hmmm...what do ya know.

619
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:33,584
Yep, and the postman
brought it just the same.

620
00:38:36,508 --> 00:38:38,208
What do ya know?

621
00:39:01,532 --> 00:39:03,532
Well...three years have gone by.

622
00:39:04,556 --> 00:39:06,556
The sun's come up over a thousand times.

623
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,580
Summers and winters have cracked
the mountains a little bit more,

624
00:39:09,604 --> 00:39:11,604
and the rain's brought
down some of the dirt.

625
00:39:11,628 --> 00:39:13,628
Some babies who weren't even born before...

626
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:15,652
have begun talking
regular sentences already.

627
00:39:16,576 --> 00:39:18,776
And some folks who thought
they were right young and spry...

628
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,200
have discovered they can't bound up
a flight of stairs the way they used to...

629
00:39:22,224 --> 00:39:24,224
without their hearts flutterin' a little.

630
00:39:24,248 --> 00:39:26,548
All that can happen in a thousand days.

631
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:29,572
Nature's been pushin' and contrivin'
in other ways too.

632
00:39:29,596 --> 00:39:32,596
A number of young people
fell in love and got married.

633
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,320
Most everybody in the world gets married.

634
00:39:35,344 --> 00:39:37,544
In this town,
there aren't hardly any exceptions.

635
00:39:38,568 --> 00:39:42,068
Most everybody climbs into
the grave married.

636
00:39:43,592 --> 00:39:46,092
What you've seen
was called the "daily life".

637
00:39:46,116 --> 00:39:49,016
Let's call what you're going to see
"love and marriage".

638
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,040
So, it's three years later--1904.

639
00:39:53,564 --> 00:39:56,564
It's July 7,
just after the high school commencement.

640
00:39:56,588 --> 00:39:59,388
That's the time most young people
jump up and get married,

641
00:39:59,412 --> 00:40:04,312
as soon as they've passed their final examinations in solid geometry and Cicero's orations.

642
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:08,536
That's the time most young people
think themselves fitted to get married.

643
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,560
It's early morning again--
this time it's been raining.

644
00:40:11,584 --> 00:40:14,584
It's been thunderin' and pourin'.

645
00:40:15,508 --> 00:40:19,508
I don't know...
may start in again any moment.

646
00:40:22,532 --> 00:40:24,932
Yeah...there's the 5:45 for Boston.

647
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:29,156
<i>And there's Si Crowell, delivering
the papers like his brother before him.<i>

648
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,580
<i>And there's Mrs. Gibbs...<i>

649
00:40:32,604 --> 00:40:37,504
<i>and Mrs. Webb coming downstairs to get breakfast just as though this were an ordinary day.<i>

650
00:40:38,528 --> 00:40:40,528
<i>I don't have to point out
to the women in the audience...<i>

651
00:40:40,552 --> 00:40:42,552
<i>that both these ladies
they see before them...<i>

652
00:40:42,576 --> 00:40:48,076
<i>both these ladies have been cooking three meals a day-- one of 'em for 21 years and the other for 25--<i>

653
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,100
<i>and never took a summer vacation.<i>

654
00:40:51,524 --> 00:40:54,224
<i>They raised two children apiece,
washed, cleaned the house,<i>

655
00:40:54,248 --> 00:40:56,248
<i>and never had a nervous breakdown.<i>

656
00:40:58,072 --> 00:41:01,072
<i>And here comes Howie Newsome
and Bessie delivering the milk.<i>

657
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:07,896
- Mornin', Howie.
- Mornin', Si.

658
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,020
Anything in the paper I oughta know?

659
00:41:10,044 --> 00:41:12,444
Nothin' much, 'cept for George is...

660
00:41:12,468 --> 00:41:14,868
about the best baseball pitcher
Grover's Corners ever had.

661
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:16,892
George Gibbs, huh?

662
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:20,516
I don't see how he can give up
a thing like that just to get married.

663
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,040
Would you have, Howie?

664
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:24,164
Can't say, never had no talent that way,

665
00:41:24,188 --> 00:41:26,188
but in '95, we had a player, Si,

666
00:41:26,212 --> 00:41:28,212
that even George Gibbs
couldn't have touched.

667
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:29,736
Name of Hank Todd.

668
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,760
But he went down to Maine
to become a parson.

669
00:41:31,784 --> 00:41:33,784
A wonderful ballplayer.

670
00:41:34,008 --> 00:41:36,008
- Si.
- Howie.

671
00:41:44,932 --> 00:41:46,432
Mornin', Mrs. Gibbs.

672
00:41:46,456 --> 00:41:47,756
<i>Mornin', Howie.<i>

673
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,580
Too bad it's so wet, but I guess
it's cleared up for good.

674
00:41:50,604 --> 00:41:53,504
I certainly hope it has. But I'll have
a house full of relations today, Howie.

675
00:41:53,528 --> 00:41:56,028
Looks like I'll need
three of milk and two of cream.

676
00:41:56,052 --> 00:41:59,652
Three of milk and two of cream. My wife
says to tell ya we hope they'll be happy.

677
00:41:59,676 --> 00:42:02,676
Thanks a lot, Howie. Tell your wife
I hope she gets to the weddin'.

678
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,700
Maybe she can.
She'll get there if she can.

679
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,324
Mornin', Mrs. Webb.

680
00:42:08,348 --> 00:42:09,648
Mornin', Mr. Newsome.

681
00:42:09,672 --> 00:42:11,872
I told ya four quarts, but I hope
you can spare me another.

682
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,896
Yes, I brought you a pint of cream too.

683
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,920
Mrs. Newsome told me special to tell ya...

684
00:42:15,944 --> 00:42:18,044
as we hope they'll be very happy.
I know they'll be.

685
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:20,468
Thank ya, Mr. Newsome,
and thank Mrs. Newsome.

686
00:42:20,492 --> 00:42:22,492
We're countin' on seein' ya at the church.

687
00:42:22,516 --> 00:42:25,016
Yes, we hope to get there alright.
Wouldn't miss that.

688
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,140
Well, Ma, the day's come for
losing one of your chicks.

689
00:42:33,164 --> 00:42:35,164
Frank Gibbs, don't you say another word!

690
00:42:35,188 --> 00:42:36,888
I feel like cryin' any minute.

691
00:42:36,912 --> 00:42:38,412
Sit down and drink your coffee.

692
00:42:38,436 --> 00:42:41,936
Groom's upstairs shaving himself,
only there isn't very much to shave.

693
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,060
He's whistling and singing
like he was glad to leave us.

694
00:42:45,084 --> 00:42:48,984
Every now and then saying
"I do" to the mirror,

695
00:42:49,008 --> 00:42:51,008
but it don't sound convincing to me.

696
00:42:51,032 --> 00:42:53,032
I don't know how he's gonna get along.

697
00:42:53,056 --> 00:42:55,056
I've always arranged his clothes,

698
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,080
seen to it his feet were dry,
and he had warm things on.

699
00:42:58,104 --> 00:43:01,104
They're too young.
Emily'll never think of those things.

700
00:43:01,128 --> 00:43:02,828
He'll catch his death of cold
within a week.

701
00:43:02,852 --> 00:43:04,452
I remember my wedding morning, Julie.

702
00:43:04,476 --> 00:43:05,976
Don't start that, Frank Gibbs.

703
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I was the scaredest young fellow
in the state of New Hampshire.

704
00:43:09,024 --> 00:43:11,024
Thought I'd made a mistake for sure.

705
00:43:11,048 --> 00:43:13,048
When I saw you coming down the aisle,

706
00:43:13,072 --> 00:43:15,672
I thought you were the prettiest girl
I'd ever seen.

707
00:43:15,696 --> 00:43:18,996
The whole trouble was,
I'd never seen you before.

708
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,820
There I was right in the Congregational
Church being married to a total stranger.

709
00:43:22,844 --> 00:43:24,644
How do you think I felt?

710
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:27,168
I tell ya, Frank,
weddin's are perfectly horrible things.

711
00:43:27,192 --> 00:43:29,192
Farces, that's what they are.

712
00:43:30,916 --> 00:43:32,616
Made somethin' for ya.

713
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,640
Why Julie Hersey!

714
00:43:34,664 --> 00:43:36,664
French toast.

715
00:43:37,088 --> 00:43:38,788
It ain't hard to make.

716
00:43:38,812 --> 00:43:40,712
Besides, I had to do something.

717
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:43,036
How d'ya sleep last night, Julie?

718
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:47,060
Heard a lot of hours struck off.

719
00:43:47,084 --> 00:43:49,084
I get a shock every time
I think of George...

720
00:43:49,108 --> 00:43:51,108
setting out as a family man.

721
00:43:51,132 --> 00:43:53,932
That great gangling thing.

722
00:43:54,956 --> 00:43:58,156
I tell you, Julie, there's nothing
in the world so terrifying as a son.

723
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:01,980
The relation between a father and a son
is the dangdest, awkwardest...

724
00:44:02,004 --> 00:44:05,004
Well, mother and daughter's no picnic,
I can tell ya.

725
00:44:08,028 --> 00:44:13,128
I do...I do...I do...I do.

726
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:19,052
They'll have a lot of trouble, I suppose,
but that's none of our business.

727
00:44:19,076 --> 00:44:22,076
Everybody's got a right
to their own troubles.

728
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,900
You know one thing that scared me
when I married you?

729
00:44:27,924 --> 00:44:29,924
Go along with you.

730
00:44:29,948 --> 00:44:34,948
I was afraid we didn't have material for
conversation more than'd last a few weeks.

731
00:44:40,072 --> 00:44:43,072
I was afraid we'd run out and
have to eat our meals in silence.

732
00:44:43,096 --> 00:44:44,896
That's a fact.

733
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:50,720
Well, you and I have been conversing for 20 years without any noticeable barren spells.

734
00:44:50,744 --> 00:44:53,644
Good weather, bad weather,
it ain't very choice,

735
00:44:53,668 --> 00:44:55,668
but I always find something to say.

736
00:44:56,392 --> 00:44:59,992
- Did you hear Rebecca stirring around up there?
- No.

737
00:45:00,016 --> 00:45:03,216
This is the only day in the year
when she isn't managing everyone's affairs.

738
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,040
She's pouting in her room,
and I have an idea she's crying.

739
00:45:06,064 --> 00:45:08,064
Land sakes, this has got to stop!

740
00:45:08,088 --> 00:45:12,088
Rebecca...Rebecca,
come and eat your breakfast.

741
00:45:19,812 --> 00:45:21,312
Good morning, everybody!

742
00:45:21,336 --> 00:45:23,336
Only four more hours to live!

743
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,060
<i>George Gibbs, where ya goin'?<i>

744
00:45:27,084 --> 00:45:29,084
I'm just steppin' across the grass
to see my girl.

745
00:45:29,108 --> 00:45:31,608
Now, George, put your rubbers on.
It's been rainin' hard.

746
00:45:31,632 --> 00:45:34,032
Don't step out of this house
unless you're prepared.

747
00:45:34,056 --> 00:45:35,856
Oh, Ma!
It's just a step!

748
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,380
<i> You'll catch your death of cold
and cough through the service!<i>

749
00:45:38,404 --> 00:45:39,904
- Ahh...
<i>- George.<i>

750
00:45:39,928 --> 00:45:41,928
Do as your mother tells ya!

751
00:45:46,052 --> 00:45:48,252
<i>From tomorrow on,
you can kill yourself in all weather,<i>

752
00:45:48,276 --> 00:45:51,976
but when you're in my house,
you'll live wisely, thank you.

753
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,500
Maybe Mrs. Webb ain't used to
callers at 7:00 in the mornin'.

754
00:45:55,024 --> 00:45:56,624
Here, have a cup of coffee first!

755
00:45:56,648 --> 00:45:58,648
Be back in a minute!

756
00:46:00,872 --> 00:46:02,672
- Good mornin', George.
- Good mornin', Mother Webb.

757
00:46:02,696 --> 00:46:03,896
Goodness, you frightened me.

758
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,820
George, I hate to say it, but you
understand, I can't ask you in.

759
00:46:06,844 --> 00:46:09,344
- Why not? - You know as well as I do
a groom can't see...

760
00:46:09,368 --> 00:46:12,168
his bride on his wedding day,
till he sees her in church first.

761
00:46:12,192 --> 00:46:13,592
That's just a superstition.

762
00:46:13,616 --> 00:46:15,616
- Good morning, Mr. Webb.
- Mornin', George.

763
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,440
You don't believe in
that superstition, do you?

764
00:46:17,464 --> 00:46:19,964
There's a lot of common sense
in superstitions, George.

765
00:46:19,988 --> 00:46:24,488
Millions have followed it, and don't you be
the first to fly in the face of custom.

766
00:46:26,012 --> 00:46:28,012
- How's Emily?
- She hasn't waked up yet.

767
00:46:28,036 --> 00:46:30,036
Haven't heard a sound out of her.

768
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:33,960
- Emily's asleep? - No wonder, we were up
till all hours sewin' and packin'.

769
00:46:34,084 --> 00:46:37,984
George, you sit down here with Mr. Webb
and drink that cup of coffee.

770
00:46:38,008 --> 00:46:41,808
I'll run up and see that she
doesn't come down and surprise ya.

771
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,732
There's some bacon there.
Don't be too long about it.

772
00:47:14,056 --> 00:47:16,056
Well, George, how are ya?

773
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,080
Well, I'm fine.

774
00:47:21,504 --> 00:47:27,004
Mr. Webb...what common sense
could there be in a superstition like that?

775
00:47:28,028 --> 00:47:31,528
Well, George, on the weddin' mornin',
a girl's head is full of...

776
00:47:31,552 --> 00:47:34,052
oh, you know, clothes
and one thing or another.

777
00:47:34,076 --> 00:47:36,076
Don't you think that's probably it?

778
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:40,200
Oh, yeah...I think that's it.

779
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:42,224
I guess I never thought of that before.

780
00:47:42,248 --> 00:47:46,048
A girl's apt to be a mite nervous
on her weddin' day.

781
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:53,072
Gee, I wish a person could get married
without all that marchin' up and down.

782
00:47:53,096 --> 00:47:56,796
Every man that's ever lived
has felt that way, George,

783
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,920
but it hasn't been any use.

784
00:47:58,944 --> 00:48:02,044
It's the womenfolks who
build up weddin's, my boy.

785
00:48:03,068 --> 00:48:05,968
A man looks mighty
small at a weddin', George.

786
00:48:05,992 --> 00:48:07,992
All those good women standing
shoulder to shoulder...

787
00:48:08,016 --> 00:48:12,016
makin' sure that the knot's
tied in a mighty public way.

788
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,640
But you believe in it, don't you, Mr. Webb?

789
00:48:18,064 --> 00:48:21,064
Yes...oh, yes,
now don't misunderstand me, George.

790
00:48:22,088 --> 00:48:24,088
Marriage is a wonderful thing.
A wonderful thing.

791
00:48:25,012 --> 00:48:28,012
- Don't you forget that, George!
- No, sir.

792
00:48:33,036 --> 00:48:38,036
Mr. Webb...how old were you
when you got married?

793
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:44,060
Well, you see, I'd been to college and
I'd taken a little time to get settled.

794
00:48:44,084 --> 00:48:46,084
Mrs. Webb wasn't much older
than what Emily is.

795
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:49,508
Oh, age hasn't much to do with it, my boy.

796
00:48:51,032 --> 00:48:54,032
That is, compared with...other things.

797
00:48:55,056 --> 00:48:57,056
What were you gonna say, Mr. Webb?

798
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:02,080
Oh, I don't know,
was I going to say somethin'?

799
00:49:03,804 --> 00:49:11,004
George...I was remembering the other night the advice my father gave me when I got married.

800
00:49:11,028 --> 00:49:13,028
Yes, he said, "Charles," he said.

801
00:49:13,052 --> 00:49:17,652
"Start right off by showin' her who's boss.

802
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:22,076
"Best thing to do is to give
an order about something.

803
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:25,000
"Even if it don't make sense.

804
00:49:25,024 --> 00:49:28,024
Just so she'll learn to obey," he said.

805
00:49:29,048 --> 00:49:31,048
Then he said,
"If anything about her irritates you,

806
00:49:31,072 --> 00:49:32,372
"conversation or anything,

807
00:49:32,396 --> 00:49:34,396
"get right up and leave the house.

808
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,420
That'll make it clear to her."

809
00:49:36,444 --> 00:49:38,844
And oh, yes, he said,

810
00:49:38,868 --> 00:49:41,868
"Never tell your wife
how much money you have."

811
00:49:41,892 --> 00:49:43,392
Never!

812
00:49:43,416 --> 00:49:44,916
Well, I couldn't do exactly that...

813
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,415
So I overlooked his advice,
and I've been happy ever since.

814
00:49:51,716 --> 00:49:53,716
Let that be a lesson to you, my boy.

815
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:57,140
Never ask advice of anybody
on personal matters.

816
00:49:57,164 --> 00:49:59,764
<i>George, Emily's got to come down
and eat her breakfast.<i>

817
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,788
She sends you her love,
but she don't want to lay eyes on ya.

818
00:50:01,812 --> 00:50:03,812
Good-bye.

819
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:07,636
Good-bye.

820
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,260
Myrtle...I guess you didn't know about
that older superstition.

821
00:50:14,284 --> 00:50:15,584
What do you mean, Charles?

822
00:50:15,608 --> 00:50:17,608
Since the caveman, no bridegroom
should see his father-in-law...

823
00:50:17,632 --> 00:50:19,732
on the day of the weddin' or near it.

824
00:50:19,756 --> 00:50:21,756
Remember that.

825
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:30,780
Now, before we get on with the wedding,
I think we should see how it all began--

826
00:50:30,804 --> 00:50:32,804
this plan to spend a lifetime together.

827
00:50:32,828 --> 00:50:36,728
I'm awfully interested in
how such big things begin.

828
00:50:37,752 --> 00:50:42,052
You know, you're 21 or 22,
then...you're 70.

829
00:50:42,776 --> 00:50:45,776
You've been a lawyer for 50 years,
and the white-haired lady beside you...

830
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,700
has eaten 50,000 meals with you.

831
00:50:48,724 --> 00:50:51,624
How do such things begin?

832
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:54,748
Now, George and Emily are gonna show you the conversation they had when they first knew,

833
00:50:54,772 --> 00:50:57,772
as the saying goes,
they were meant for one another.

834
00:50:57,796 --> 00:51:00,796
<i>Now, it all happened last year
on the way home from school.<i>

835
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:03,720
<i>George had just been elected
the president of the senior class,<i>

836
00:51:03,744 --> 00:51:06,744
<i>and Emily had just been
elected secretary and treasurer.<i>

837
00:51:06,768 --> 00:51:08,768
<i> Now, you all know how important that is.<i>

838
00:51:08,792 --> 00:51:12,792
Emily, can I carry your books home for ya?

839
00:51:12,816 --> 00:51:16,316
Oh, well...thank you, it isn't far.

840
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:22,340
Bob, if I'm late, start practice.
We'll give Herb some long, high ones.

841
00:51:22,364 --> 00:51:24,364
<i>Alright.<i>

842
00:51:27,388 --> 00:51:29,588
Awfully glad you were elected too, Emily.

843
00:51:29,612 --> 00:51:31,612
Thank you.

844
00:51:32,436 --> 00:51:36,236
Emily, why are you mad at me?

845
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,260
Oh, I'm not mad at you.

846
00:51:39,384 --> 00:51:41,384
You've been treating me so funny lately.

847
00:51:44,308 --> 00:51:47,308
Well, since you asked me, I might as well
say it right out, George.

848
00:51:48,332 --> 00:51:50,332
- Good-bye, Miss Corcoran.
- Emily.

849
00:51:50,356 --> 00:51:53,356
- Good-bye, Mrs. Corcoran.
- George.

850
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,380
What is it?

851
00:51:57,304 --> 00:52:01,304
I don't like the whole change
that's come over you this last year.

852
00:52:04,328 --> 00:52:07,328
I'm sorry if that hurt your feelings,

853
00:52:07,352 --> 00:52:11,352
but I've just got to tell the truth
and shame the devil.

854
00:52:11,376 --> 00:52:14,376
Change?
What do you mean?

855
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,300
Well, up to a year ago,
I used to like you a lot.

856
00:52:20,324 --> 00:52:26,224
I used to watch you while you did everything, because we've been friends so long.

857
00:52:27,348 --> 00:52:30,348
Then you started spending
all your time at baseball,

858
00:52:30,372 --> 00:52:34,072
and you never stop to
speak to anybody anymore!

859
00:52:34,096 --> 00:52:36,096
Not to really speak!

860
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,320
Not even to your own family you didn't,

861
00:52:38,344 --> 00:52:41,344
and George, it's a fact.

862
00:52:41,368 --> 00:52:47,268
Since you've been captain,
you've got awful stuck up and conceited,

863
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:49,392
and all the girls say so.

864
00:52:50,816 --> 00:52:52,816
It hurts me to hear 'em say it,

865
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,340
but I have to agree with them a little,
because it's true.

866
00:52:59,364 --> 00:53:04,364
Gosh, Emily, I never thought that
such thing was happening to me.

867
00:53:06,388 --> 00:53:10,388
I guess it's hard for a fella not to have
some faults creep into his character.

868
00:53:12,412 --> 00:53:14,812
I always expect a man to be perfect,

869
00:53:14,836 --> 00:53:16,336
and I think he should be.

870
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:21,360
Well, I...I don't think it's possible
to be perfect, Emily.

871
00:53:21,384 --> 00:53:23,884
Well, my father is.

872
00:53:23,908 --> 00:53:26,308
And as far as I can see, your father is.

873
00:53:28,332 --> 00:53:31,332
There's no reason on earth why
you shouldn't be too.

874
00:53:32,856 --> 00:53:35,356
I feel that it's just the other way around.

875
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,380
Men aren't naturally good, but girls are.

876
00:53:41,304 --> 00:53:44,304
Well, you might as well know right now
that I'm not perfect.

877
00:53:46,328 --> 00:53:50,128
It isn't as easy for a girl
to be perfect as a man,

878
00:53:50,152 --> 00:53:55,252
because...well...

879
00:53:55,276 --> 00:53:58,276
we girls are more nervous.

880
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,300
Oh, now, I'm sorry I said that about you.

881
00:54:05,324 --> 00:54:07,324
I don't know what made me say it.

882
00:54:07,348 --> 00:54:10,848
- Emily... - Now, I can see
it isn't the truth at all.

883
00:54:12,372 --> 00:54:15,372
Suddenly, I feel it isn't important anyway.

884
00:54:21,396 --> 00:54:27,296
Emily...would you like
an ice cream soda or somethin'...

885
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,320
before you go home?

886
00:54:33,344 --> 00:54:35,344
Thank you, I would.

887
00:54:39,068 --> 00:54:41,068
Hello, George.
Hello, Emily.

888
00:54:41,092 --> 00:54:42,592
Hello, Mr. Morgan.

889
00:54:42,616 --> 00:54:44,316
Now, what can I do for ya?

890
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:47,340
Why, Emily Webb,
what you been cryin' about?

891
00:54:47,364 --> 00:54:50,364
She got an awful scare, Mr. Morgan,

892
00:54:50,388 --> 00:54:52,388
that hardware store wagon
almost ran over her.

893
00:54:53,812 --> 00:54:56,612
Everybody says that Tom Huckins
drives like a crazy man.

894
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:59,336
Well, here, let me
give you a glass of water.

895
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,360
Gracious, you look all shook up.

896
00:55:02,384 --> 00:55:04,684
I tell ya, you got to look both ways...

897
00:55:04,708 --> 00:55:06,408
before you cross Main Street these days.

898
00:55:06,432 --> 00:55:08,432
It's getting worse every year.

899
00:55:08,456 --> 00:55:10,456
What'll you have?

900
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,380
I'll have a strawberry phosphate,
Mr. Morgan.

901
00:55:14,304 --> 00:55:16,304
Oh, no, Emily, have a soda with me.

902
00:55:16,328 --> 00:55:17,628
Well, I...

903
00:55:17,652 --> 00:55:19,652
Two strawberry ice cream sodas, Mr. Morgan.

904
00:55:20,376 --> 00:55:22,376
Two strawberry ice cream sodas.
Yes...

905
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,300
Yes, sir, I want to tell ya something.

906
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:30,324
There are 275 horses in Grover's Corners
this very moment I'm talkin' to you.

907
00:55:30,348 --> 00:55:32,348
State inspector was in here yesterday.

908
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:35,372
Now, with all these
automobiles coming along,

909
00:55:35,396 --> 00:55:38,396
looks to me like the only safe place
to stay was to home.

910
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:40,620
I can remember the time
when a dog could lie...

911
00:55:40,644 --> 00:55:42,844
in the middle of
Main Street all day long...

912
00:55:42,868 --> 00:55:45,368
without anything comin'
along to disturb him.

913
00:55:46,392 --> 00:55:48,392
There ya are.

914
00:55:48,416 --> 00:55:50,416
Howdy, Mrs. Ellis, what can I do for ya?

915
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,340
- I've got a prescription.
- Yes, well, let's see.

916
00:55:53,364 --> 00:55:55,064
<i>Shouldn't take long to fill that.<i>

917
00:55:55,088 --> 00:55:57,188
<i>Just sit down, and I'll be
with you in just a minute.

918
00:55:57,212 --> 00:55:59,012
It's so expensive.

919
00:55:59,036 --> 00:56:01,036
No, Emily, don't you think about that.

920
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,360
We're celebratin' our election.

921
00:56:04,384 --> 00:56:07,884
Emily, I...want to ask you a favor.

922
00:56:09,308 --> 00:56:10,808
What?

923
00:56:12,332 --> 00:56:17,332
If I go away to
State Agricultural College next year,

924
00:56:17,356 --> 00:56:20,356
will ya write me a letter once in awhile?

925
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,380
I certainly will.

926
00:56:25,304 --> 00:56:27,204
I certainly will, George.

927
00:56:30,128 --> 00:56:33,328
It certainly seems like
being away three years,

928
00:56:33,352 --> 00:56:36,852
you'd get out of touch with things.

929
00:56:38,376 --> 00:56:43,276
Maybe letters from Grover's Corners
won't seem so interesting after awhile.

930
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,800
Grover's Corners isn't
a very important place...

931
00:56:45,824 --> 00:56:48,824
when you think of all New Hampshire,

932
00:56:50,348 --> 00:56:52,848
but I think it's a very nice town.

933
00:56:54,372 --> 00:56:59,372
The day wouldn't come when I wouldn't
want to know everything about our town.

934
00:56:59,396 --> 00:57:01,396
Well, I know that's true, Emily.

935
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:07,320
Well...
I'll try to make my letters interesting.

936
00:57:12,144 --> 00:57:15,344
You know, Emily,
whenever I meet a farmer,

937
00:57:15,368 --> 00:57:17,368
I ask him if he thinks it's important...

938
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:20,392
to go to agricultural school
to be a good farmer.

939
00:57:20,416 --> 00:57:22,116
Why, George!

940
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:25,340
Yeah, and some of 'em
even say it's a waste of time.

941
00:57:25,364 --> 00:57:30,364
You can get all that stuff anyway
in the pamphlets the government puts out.

942
00:57:32,388 --> 00:57:33,888
Uncle Luke's gettin' pretty old,

943
00:57:33,912 --> 00:57:37,612
and he's about ready for me
to start taking over his farm.

944
00:57:38,836 --> 00:57:41,336
Tomorrow, if I could.

945
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:47,260
Oh, but George, maybe it's important for you to go and learn all that about cattle judging...

946
00:57:47,284 --> 00:57:50,784
and soils and those things.

947
00:57:52,308 --> 00:57:54,308
Of course, I don't know.

948
00:57:56,332 --> 00:58:00,332
Emily...
I'm gonna make up my mind right now.

949
00:58:00,356 --> 00:58:01,856
I won't go.

950
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,380
I'll tell Pa about it tonight.

951
00:58:03,404 --> 00:58:07,404
But George, you don't have to decide
right now. It's a whole year away.

952
00:58:07,428 --> 00:58:12,328
Emily, I'm glad you spoke to me
about that fault in my character.

953
00:58:12,952 --> 00:58:16,952
Everything you said was right,
but there was one thing wrong with it.

954
00:58:16,976 --> 00:58:20,276
That's when you said
I wasn't noticing people.

955
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,300
You, for instance.

956
00:58:24,324 --> 00:58:27,324
You say you were watching me
when I did everything.

957
00:58:27,348 --> 00:58:30,348
I was doin' the same thing
about you all the time.

958
00:58:30,372 --> 00:58:32,372
Why...

959
00:58:32,396 --> 00:58:39,296
Sure, I always thought about you
as one of the chief people I thought about.

960
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:42,820
I always made sure you
were sitting on the bleachers,

961
00:58:42,844 --> 00:58:44,844
who you were with.

962
00:58:46,268 --> 00:58:49,368
For three days now, I've been trying
to walk home with you,

963
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:52,292
but something always got in the way.

964
00:58:52,316 --> 00:58:57,316
Yesterday, I was standing out
by the wall waiting for you,

965
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:00,140
and you walked home with Miss Corcoran.

966
00:59:03,364 --> 00:59:08,164
Oh, George...life's awful funny.

967
00:59:08,188 --> 00:59:09,688
How could I have known...

968
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:15,312
Emily, I'm gonna tell you why
I'm not going to agricultural school.

969
00:59:15,336 --> 00:59:20,236
I think once you've found a person
you're very fond of...

970
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:23,360
and a person who's fond of you too...

971
00:59:23,384 --> 00:59:28,384
and likes you well enough
to be interested in your character,

972
00:59:28,408 --> 00:59:32,308
I think that's just as
important as college is.

973
00:59:32,332 --> 00:59:34,132
Even more so.

974
00:59:34,156 --> 00:59:36,156
That's what I think.

975
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:40,180
I think it's awfully important too.

976
00:59:42,804 --> 00:59:44,804
Emily.

977
00:59:44,828 --> 00:59:47,328
Yes, George?

978
00:59:48,352 --> 00:59:55,152
Emily, if I do improve
and make a big change,

979
00:59:57,376 --> 01:00:03,376
would you be...I mean...
could you be...

980
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,900
Well, I am now!

981
01:00:05,924 --> 01:00:08,424
I always have been!

982
01:00:12,748 --> 01:00:17,248
So I guess this is a pretty important
talk we've been having.

983
01:00:19,372 --> 01:00:21,372
Yes.

984
01:00:23,396 --> 01:00:25,396
Yes.

985
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,920
<i>- Good-bye, Mrs. Ellis.
- Good day.<i>

986
01:00:41,844 --> 01:00:44,344
If you'll wait a minute,
I'll walk you home.

987
01:00:55,868 --> 01:00:58,168
- Mr. Morgan.
- Yes.

988
01:00:59,892 --> 01:01:02,892
I'll have to go home and get the money
to pay you for this.

989
01:01:02,916 --> 01:01:05,316
Why, George Gibbs,
do you mean to tell me...

990
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:06,840
Mr. Morgan, I got a reason.

991
01:01:06,864 --> 01:01:10,264
I'll leave my gold watch
with you until I get back.

992
01:01:10,288 --> 01:01:12,788
No, no, you keep your watch, George.
I'll trust ya.

993
01:01:12,812 --> 01:01:14,312
But I'll be back in five minutes.

994
01:01:14,336 --> 01:01:16,336
I'll trust ya for ten years, George.

995
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:18,360
Not a day more, though.

996
01:01:23,884 --> 01:01:25,884
- Feeling all right now, Emily?
- Oh, yes.

997
01:01:25,908 --> 01:01:28,408
Thank you, Mr. Morgan, it's nothing.

998
01:01:30,032 --> 01:01:32,032
I'm ready.

999
01:01:43,756 --> 01:01:46,356
Well, now, to get on with the wedding.

1000
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,880
<i>There's a lot of things
to be said about a wedding.<i>

1001
01:01:51,904 --> 01:01:54,804
<i>We can't get to more
than one wedding, naturally,<i>

1002
01:01:54,828 --> 01:01:56,828
<i>especially not a wedding
in Grover's Corners<i>

1003
01:01:56,852 --> 01:01:58,852
<i>where weddings are mighty short and plain.<i>

1004
01:01:59,876 --> 01:02:02,876
<i>People think a lot of thoughts
during a wedding.<i>

1005
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:06,800
<i>The bride, the groom, the relatives,
and the guests.<i>

1006
01:02:06,824 --> 01:02:08,824
<i>And even the minister.<i>

1007
01:02:10,248 --> 01:02:13,248
<i>Yes...a lot of thoughts
go on during a wedding.<i>

1008
01:02:15,872 --> 01:02:18,772
<i>I've married 200 couples in my day.<i>

1009
01:02:18,796 --> 01:02:21,796
<i>M marries M.<i>

1010
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:24,720
<i>Millions of them.<i>

1011
01:02:24,744 --> 01:02:28,844
<i>The cottage, the go-cart,
the Sunday afternoon drives in the country,<i>

1012
01:02:28,868 --> 01:02:31,768
<i>the first rheumatism, the grandchildren,<i>

1013
01:02:31,792 --> 01:02:36,892
<i>the second rheumatism, the death bed,
the reading of the will.<i>

1014
01:02:39,816 --> 01:02:43,416
<i>Once in a thousand times, it's interesting.<i>

1015
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:48,240
<i>I don't know why on earth
I should be crying.<i>

1016
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:51,764
<i>I suppose there's nothin' to cry about,<i>

1017
01:02:51,788 --> 01:02:56,488
<i>but this morning at breakfast,
it just come over me.<i>

1018
01:02:56,512 --> 01:03:01,312
<i>There was Emily, eatin' her breakfast,
as she's done for 17 years.<i>

1019
01:03:02,836 --> 01:03:05,836
<i>She's going out of my house.<i>

1020
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,860
<i>I suppose that's it.<i>

1021
01:03:10,884 --> 01:03:14,784
<i>I never felt so alone in my whole life.<i>

1022
01:03:14,808 --> 01:03:18,308
<i>I don't want to get married.<i>

1023
01:03:18,332 --> 01:03:21,332
<i>Why can't I stay for awhile as I am?<i>

1024
01:03:22,856 --> 01:03:25,756
<i>Papa, darling, don't you remember
what you used to say...<i>

1025
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:28,880
<i>all the time that I was your girl?<i>

1026
01:03:28,904 --> 01:03:31,904
<i>I don't want to get married.<i>

1027
01:03:39,328 --> 01:03:41,328
<i>I'm gonna get married.<i>

1028
01:03:41,352 --> 01:03:43,152
<i>I'm grown up.<i>

1029
01:03:43,176 --> 01:03:45,176
<i>I'm gettin' old.<i>

1030
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:49,800
<i>I don't want to get old,
takin' on all these responsibilities.<i>

1031
01:03:49,824 --> 01:03:52,324
<i>Why is everybody pushing me so?<i>

1032
01:03:52,348 --> 01:03:56,348
<i>All I want to do is be a fella,
and I'm gonna get married.<i>

1033
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:04,972
Cheer up, Ma, I'm gettin' married.

1034
01:04:06,396 --> 01:04:07,896
Come on, Ma.

1035
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,920
Now, Ma, you'll see Thursday night.

1036
01:04:09,944 --> 01:04:12,444
Emily and I will be over for supper
every Thursday night.

1037
01:04:12,468 --> 01:04:14,468
You'll see.

1038
01:04:16,392 --> 01:04:18,392
Come on, Ma,
we've got to get ready for this.

1039
01:04:18,416 --> 01:04:21,316
- Got the ring?
- Oh, yes, sir.

1040
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:23,340
Come on.

1041
01:05:19,364 --> 01:05:20,864
It's a lovely wedding.

1042
01:05:20,888 --> 01:05:23,188
Loveliest wedding I ever saw.

1043
01:05:23,212 --> 01:05:26,712
Oh, I do love a good wedding, don't you?

1044
01:05:26,736 --> 01:05:29,336
Doesn't she make a lovely bride?

1045
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:43,260
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered together here...

1046
01:05:43,284 --> 01:05:46,384
in the sight of God
and in the face of this company...

1047
01:05:46,408 --> 01:05:48,908
to join together this man and this woman...

1048
01:05:48,932 --> 01:05:50,732
in holy matrimony.

1049
01:05:50,756 --> 01:05:53,256
Don't know when I seen
such a lovely wedding.

1050
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,680
I always cry.

1051
01:05:55,704 --> 01:05:57,804
I don't know why it is,
but I always cry.

1052
01:05:57,828 --> 01:06:01,328
<i>I just like to see young people happy.<i>

1053
01:06:01,352 --> 01:06:03,852
<i>They're such a lovely couple.<i>

1054
01:06:04,376 --> 01:06:07,276
<i>I've never been to such a nice wedding.<i>

1055
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:10,000
To love and to cherish,

1056
01:06:10,024 --> 01:06:11,824
till death you do part,

1057
01:06:11,848 --> 01:06:14,348
according to God's holy ordinance
and thereto...

1058
01:06:14,372 --> 01:06:15,672
plight her your troth?

1059
01:06:15,696 --> 01:06:17,396
I do.

1060
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,320
Do you, Emily,
take George to your wedded husband,

1061
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:24,144
to have and to hold from this day forward,

1062
01:06:24,168 --> 01:06:27,368
for better, for worse,
for richer, for poorer,

1063
01:06:27,392 --> 01:06:29,392
in sickness and in health,

1064
01:06:29,416 --> 01:06:32,316
to love and to cherish,
till death you do part,

1065
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:35,140
according to God's holy ordinance...

1066
01:06:35,164 --> 01:06:37,164
and thereto plight him your troth?

1067
01:06:38,588 --> 01:06:40,288
I do.

1068
01:06:41,312 --> 01:06:44,312
<i>What token dost thou give of thy sincerity?<i>

1069
01:06:45,136 --> 01:06:46,936
<i>With this ring...<i>

1070
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,760
<i>With this ring...<i>

1071
01:06:48,784 --> 01:06:49,884
<i>I thee wed.<i>

1072
01:06:49,908 --> 01:06:51,308
<i>I thee wed.<i>

1073
01:06:51,332 --> 01:06:53,332
For as much as George and Emily...

1074
01:06:53,356 --> 01:06:55,356
have consented together in holy wedlock,

1075
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:58,380
and have witnessed the same
before God and this company,

1076
01:06:58,404 --> 01:07:01,304
<i>and have declared the same
by giving and receiving a ring,<i>

1077
01:07:01,328 --> 01:07:04,328
<i>I pronounce that they are husband and wife.<i>

1078
01:07:05,252 --> 01:07:06,552
<i>Amen.<i>

1079
01:07:16,076 --> 01:07:17,676
Forever.

1080
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,700
Forever and ever.

1081
01:07:37,724 --> 01:07:39,724
Pay you the first of the month like usual.

1082
01:07:39,748 --> 01:07:41,248
See ya, Howie.

1083
01:07:45,372 --> 01:07:49,172
Man his age shouldn't be
drivin' one of those things.

1084
01:07:49,196 --> 01:07:52,096
Not when he's got a lot of
young fellas to do it for him.

1085
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:54,320
Howie likes to deliver the milk himself.

1086
01:07:54,344 --> 01:07:56,344
Says he gets the feel of the town that way.

1087
01:07:56,368 --> 01:07:58,668
You know, in all these years,
he never kept a book.

1088
01:07:58,692 --> 01:08:00,792
Carries all the accounts in his head.

1089
01:08:00,816 --> 01:08:02,816
I hear he's been doin' so well...

1090
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:05,040
he's begun lockin'
his front door at nights.

1091
01:08:05,064 --> 01:08:06,364
Afraid of burglars.

1092
01:08:06,388 --> 01:08:08,088
Ain't no burglars in this town yet.

1093
01:08:08,112 --> 01:08:10,312
No, but Howie's heard about 'em.

1094
01:08:30,836 --> 01:08:33,836
This time, nine years
have gone by, friends.

1095
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,860
It's the summer of 1913.

1096
01:08:36,884 --> 01:08:39,584
Gradual changes in Grover's Corners.

1097
01:08:39,608 --> 01:08:41,708
Horses are gettin' rarer.

1098
01:08:41,732 --> 01:08:44,032
Farmers are coming into town now in Fords.

1099
01:08:44,856 --> 01:08:50,856
Still, you'd be surprised, though, on the whole, things don't change much around here.

1100
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:57,880
This is an important part of Grover's
Corners up here on this hilltop.

1101
01:08:57,904 --> 01:08:59,904
Lots of sky, lots of clouds,

1102
01:08:59,928 --> 01:09:03,828
often lots of sun and moon and stars.

1103
01:09:05,652 --> 01:09:07,652
Certainly a beautiful spot up here.

1104
01:09:10,876 --> 01:09:12,776
I often wonder why people
want to be buried...

1105
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,800
in Woodlawn in Brooklyn...

1106
01:09:14,824 --> 01:09:18,724
when they might pass the same time
up here in New Hampshire.

1107
01:09:18,848 --> 01:09:23,848
Over here are the old stones...1660...1670.

1108
01:09:23,872 --> 01:09:28,872
Strong-minded people who
come a long ways to be independent.

1109
01:09:29,296 --> 01:09:33,896
<i>Over here...are some Civil War veterans.<i>

1110
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,820
Iron flags on their graves.

1111
01:09:36,844 --> 01:09:38,844
New Hampshire boys.

1112
01:09:38,868 --> 01:09:41,868
They had a notion that the Union
ought to be kept together,

1113
01:09:41,892 --> 01:09:45,892
altough they'd never seen
more than 50 miles of it themselves.

1114
01:09:45,916 --> 01:09:48,816
All they knew was a name, friends--

1115
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:50,840
the United States of America.

1116
01:09:52,864 --> 01:09:55,264
The United States of America.

1117
01:09:55,288 --> 01:09:57,788
And they went and died about it.

1118
01:10:05,812 --> 01:10:07,812
<i>This is the new part of the cemetery.<i>

1119
01:10:08,836 --> 01:10:13,636
<i>There's Mrs. Soames who enjoyed
the wedding so much, remember?<i>

1120
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:15,860
<i>And there's our friend, Mrs. Gibbs.<i>

1121
01:10:15,884 --> 01:10:18,684
<i>Yeah, Doc Gibbs lost his wife
three years ago,<i>

1122
01:10:18,708 --> 01:10:20,808
<i>just about this time.<i>

1123
01:10:20,832 --> 01:10:23,332
<i>And that little Webb's boy, Wallace,
whose appendix burst...<i>

1124
01:10:23,356 --> 01:10:25,856
<i>on a Boy Scout trip to Crawford Notch.<i>

1125
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,880
<i>There's Mr. Stimson,
the organist of the Congregational Church.<i>

1126
01:10:30,904 --> 01:10:32,904
<i>He drank a lot, they used to say.<i>

1127
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:35,228
<i>Hung himself in the attic.<i>

1128
01:10:35,252 --> 01:10:37,852
<i>They tried to hush it up,
but of course, it got around.<i>

1129
01:10:37,876 --> 01:10:39,976
<i>He wrote his own epitaph.<i>

1130
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,800
<i>Ain't a verse, exactly,
it's just a lot of notes.<i>

1131
01:10:43,824 --> 01:10:46,824
<i>I wouldn't know what it was.<i>

1132
01:10:46,848 --> 01:10:49,248
<i>It was all writ up in the Boston papers
at the time, though.<i>

1133
01:10:49,272 --> 01:10:52,772
A lot of sorrows kind of
quieted down up here too.

1134
01:10:53,396 --> 01:10:55,396
All those important things--

1135
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:59,120
mother and daughter,
husband and wife,

1136
01:10:59,144 --> 01:11:01,544
enemy and enemy,
money and miser--

1137
01:11:01,568 --> 01:11:04,368
all those terribly important things...

1138
01:11:05,392 --> 01:11:09,192
here kind of burns away.

1139
01:11:09,216 --> 01:11:11,016
Burns out.

1140
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,840
And what's left?

1141
01:11:12,864 --> 01:11:16,364
What's left when memory is gone
and your identity, Mrs. Smith?

1142
01:11:19,388 --> 01:11:21,388
Something eternal.

1143
01:11:22,312 --> 01:11:26,312
We all know down in our bones
that something is eternal,

1144
01:11:26,336 --> 01:11:28,636
and that something has to
do with human beings.

1145
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:34,360
All the greatest people that have lived for the past 5,000 years have been telling us that.

1146
01:11:34,384 --> 01:11:38,384
And yet, you'll be surprised
how we lose sight of that fact.

1147
01:11:38,408 --> 01:11:42,308
There's something eternal
about every human being.

1148
01:11:45,332 --> 01:11:49,332
I guess I'm thinking these thoughts today
on account of our friend, Emily.

1149
01:11:49,356 --> 01:11:54,356
Another baby's expected down at
that happy home we saw started.

1150
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:55,880
It's Emily's second.

1151
01:11:55,904 --> 01:11:59,304
There's a little boy about six years old,

1152
01:11:59,328 --> 01:12:02,328
but this time, Emily's pretty sick.

1153
01:12:02,352 --> 01:12:06,352
Doc Gibbs is going around these days
with a mighty worried face.

1154
01:12:39,176 --> 01:12:41,176
<i>I want to live.<i>

1155
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:45,300
<i>Oh, I want to live.<i>

1156
01:13:12,324 --> 01:13:14,324
<i>Who's coming now, Julia?<i>

1157
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:16,348
<i>My daughter-in-law, Emily Webb.<i>

1158
01:13:16,372 --> 01:13:18,372
<i>What ails her?<i>

1159
01:13:18,396 --> 01:13:21,396
<i>Trouble bringing a baby into the world.<i>

1160
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:25,220
<i>Why, I remember Emily's wedding.<i>

1161
01:13:25,244 --> 01:13:27,244
<i>Wasn't it a lovely wedding?<i>

1162
01:13:27,268 --> 01:13:31,268
<i>I remember I called on George
and Emily at their farm...<i>

1163
01:13:31,292 --> 01:13:33,292
<i>just before I died.<i>

1164
01:13:33,316 --> 01:13:35,316
<i>It's a beautiful farm.<i>

1165
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,840
<i>Dear friends, as we gather here...<i>

1166
01:14:14,864 --> 01:14:17,864
<i>in the last tribute of memory
to our loved one...<i>

1167
01:14:17,888 --> 01:14:19,888
<i>Hello, Mother Gibbs.<i>

1168
01:14:19,912 --> 01:14:21,912
<i>Hello, Emily.<i>

1169
01:14:21,936 --> 01:14:23,936
<i>Hello, Emily.<i>

1170
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,960
<i>Hello, Mrs. Soames.<i>

1171
01:14:25,984 --> 01:14:28,584
<i>Hello, sis.<i>

1172
01:14:30,108 --> 01:14:32,108
<i>Hello, Wally.<i>

1173
01:14:33,032 --> 01:14:35,032
<i>...eternal in the heavens.<i>

1174
01:14:47,656 --> 01:14:49,656
<i>Mother Gibbs, they're going.<i>

1175
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:51,680
<i>Yes, dear.<i>

1176
01:15:10,804 --> 01:15:14,604
<i>Father Gibbs is bringing some of my
flowers to you, Mother Gibbs.<i>

1177
01:15:25,728 --> 01:15:31,728
<i>Mother Gibbs, I never realized
how troubled and sad he looks.<i>

1178
01:15:31,752 --> 01:15:33,752
<i>I loved him so.<i>

1179
01:15:34,876 --> 01:15:38,876
<i>Father Gibbs...Father Gibbs!<i>

1180
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:03,700
<i>I'm so tired, Mother Gibbs.<i>

1181
01:16:06,324 --> 01:16:11,824
<i>Mother Gibbs, when does
this feeling go away--<i>

1182
01:16:11,848 --> 01:16:16,548
<i>being strange here...
how long do I...<i>

1183
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:18,272
<i>Hush, dear.<i>

1184
01:16:18,296 --> 01:16:20,596
<i>Just wait and be patient.<i>

1185
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:25,720
<i>How do you do, Mr. Stimson?<i>

1186
01:16:25,744 --> 01:16:27,744
How do you do, Emily?

1187
01:16:28,868 --> 01:16:31,768
Mother Gibbs,
George and I have made that farm...

1188
01:16:31,792 --> 01:16:34,892
into just the best place you ever saw.

1189
01:16:34,916 --> 01:16:37,116
We thought of you all the time.

1190
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:39,840
We wanted to show you the new barn...

1191
01:16:39,864 --> 01:16:42,864
and the great long cement
drinking fountain for the stock.

1192
01:16:42,888 --> 01:16:45,888
We bought that out of
the money you left us.

1193
01:16:45,912 --> 01:16:48,712
I, dear?

1194
01:16:48,736 --> 01:16:54,736
Mother Gibbs, don't you remember,
the legacy you left us?

1195
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:58,960
Why, it was more than $350.

1196
01:16:58,984 --> 01:17:01,884
Oh, yes...yes, Emily.

1197
01:17:05,808 --> 01:17:09,108
It won't be the same
for George without me...

1198
01:17:11,832 --> 01:17:13,832
but it's a lovely farm.

1199
01:17:17,856 --> 01:17:20,356
My boy's spending the day at Mrs. Carter's.

1200
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:24,880
Oh, Mr. Carter, my little boy
is spending the day at your house.

1201
01:17:24,904 --> 01:17:26,904
<i>He is?<i>

1202
01:17:26,928 --> 01:17:28,928
<i>Yes, he loves it there.<i>

1203
01:17:32,852 --> 01:17:37,852
Mother Gibbs,
one can go back...in memory...

1204
01:17:37,876 --> 01:17:40,876
and live each of those days over again!

1205
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:48,600
Why, just then, for a moment,
I was thinking about the farm,

1206
01:17:48,624 --> 01:17:51,624
and for a moment, I was there!

1207
01:17:51,648 --> 01:17:54,848
And my baby was in my arms as plain as day!

1208
01:17:54,872 --> 01:17:57,772
Yes, but when you've been here longer,

1209
01:17:57,796 --> 01:18:01,896
you'll realize that our life
here is to forget all that.

1210
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:08,820
To think of what is ahead
and be ready for what is ahead.

1211
01:18:08,844 --> 01:18:12,844
But Mother Gibbs,
how can I ever forget that life?

1212
01:18:12,868 --> 01:18:15,068
It's all I know.
It's all I had.

1213
01:18:17,892 --> 01:18:21,892
One can go back and
live all those days over again.

1214
01:18:21,916 --> 01:18:23,916
I feel it.
I know it.

1215
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:29,840
You not only live it...
you watch yourself living it.

1216
01:18:31,864 --> 01:18:33,564
I'll choose a happy day.

1217
01:18:33,588 --> 01:18:35,888
Oh, Emily, it isn't wise.

1218
01:18:35,912 --> 01:18:37,912
Really, it isn't.

1219
01:18:37,936 --> 01:18:40,936
I'll choose the day
I first knew I loved George.

1220
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:48,260
Why should that be painful?

1221
01:18:48,284 --> 01:18:52,684
Because it's the happiest days
that are the hardest to relive.

1222
01:18:52,708 --> 01:18:54,708
And to forget.

1223
01:18:54,832 --> 01:18:57,832
But I must.
I must!

1224
01:18:59,756 --> 01:19:02,856
Then chose an unimportant day.

1225
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,880
Chose the least important day in your life.

1226
01:19:05,904 --> 01:19:08,404
It will be important enough.

1227
01:19:11,828 --> 01:19:15,828
I'll choose...I'll choose.

1228
01:19:16,852 --> 01:19:21,752
<i>Yes, Emily, think hard.<i>

1229
01:19:21,776 --> 01:19:23,776
<i>Remember.<i>

1230
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,800
I'm remembering.

1231
01:19:28,824 --> 01:19:33,824
I'm remembering...
I'm remembering...

1232
01:19:36,848 --> 01:19:39,348
<i>There's Main Street!<i>

1233
01:19:40,872 --> 01:19:44,872
<i>There's Mr. Morgan's drug store
before he changed it.<i>

1234
01:19:44,896 --> 01:19:47,396
<i>And there's the livery stable!<i>

1235
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:51,820
<i>That's the town I knew as a little girl.<i>

1236
01:19:52,844 --> 01:19:56,844
<i>And look...there's the old white fence...<i>

1237
01:19:56,868 --> 01:19:58,868
<i>that used to be around our house.<i>

1238
01:19:58,892 --> 01:20:00,892
<i>Oh, I'd forgotten that!<i>

1239
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:02,916
<i>I love it so.<i>

1240
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,640
<i>There's Mama coming downstairs
to make breakfast!<i>

1241
01:20:24,764 --> 01:20:26,764
<i>Mama.<i>

1242
01:20:30,888 --> 01:20:35,888
<i>Look, there's Howie Newsome,
and there's Joe Crowell.<i>

1243
01:20:36,712 --> 01:20:39,012
- Mornin', Howie.
- Mornin', Joe.

1244
01:20:39,036 --> 01:20:42,836
<i>Children...Emily...Wally, time to get up!<i>

1245
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:46,860
- Mornin', Mrs. Webb.
- Mornin', Mr. Newsome.

1246
01:20:47,884 --> 01:20:49,384
Sure is cold.

1247
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:51,808
Yes'm, ten below at my barn, Mrs. Webb.

1248
01:20:55,832 --> 01:20:58,832
- Keep yourself dressed up, Mr. Newsome.
- Yes'm.

1249
01:20:59,856 --> 01:21:02,356
Oh, tell Emily many happy
returns of the day.

1250
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:09,880
Now, I know!
It's my 16th birthday!

1251
01:21:10,704 --> 01:21:14,104
<i>Mama, I can't find my blue
hair ribbon anywhere.<i>

1252
01:21:14,128 --> 01:21:16,328
Just open your eyes, dear, that's all.

1253
01:21:16,352 --> 01:21:18,752
I laid it out special for ya
on the dresser there.

1254
01:21:18,776 --> 01:21:20,876
If it were a snake, it'd bite ya.

1255
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,500
Oh, how young Mama looks.

1256
01:21:26,524 --> 01:21:29,324
I didn't know Mama was ever that young.

1257
01:21:29,348 --> 01:21:31,348
<i>- Mornin' Howie. 
- Mornin', Mr. Webb.<i>

1258
01:21:31,372 --> 01:21:32,472
There's Papa!

1259
01:21:32,496 --> 01:21:33,696
<i>You're up early.<i>

1260
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:35,820
<i>Been back to my old college
to make a speech.<i>

1261
01:21:35,844 --> 01:21:37,244
Any news here?

1262
01:21:37,268 --> 01:21:40,068
<i>A customer was called this mornin'
to rescue a Polish fella.<i>

1263
01:21:40,092 --> 01:21:41,592
<i>Darn near froze to death.<i>

1264
01:21:41,616 --> 01:21:43,616
I'll put that in the paper.

1265
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:48,240
Mornin', Mother.

1266
01:21:48,264 --> 01:21:49,764
Well, there you are, back at last.

1267
01:21:49,788 --> 01:21:51,988
- How'd it go, Charles?
- Oh, fine, I guess.

1268
01:21:52,012 --> 01:21:54,012
I told 'em a few things.

1269
01:21:54,036 --> 01:21:55,836
Everything all right here?

1270
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:57,860
Yes, can't think of anything
that happened special.

1271
01:21:57,884 --> 01:21:59,584
<i>It's been mighty cold.<i>

1272
01:21:59,608 --> 01:22:02,108
<i>Howie Newsome says it's ten
below down at his barn.<i>

1273
01:22:02,132 --> 01:22:04,132
Yes, well, it's colder than
that at Hamilton College.

1274
01:22:04,156 --> 01:22:06,156
Students' ears are fallin' off.

1275
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:08,180
Ain't Christian.

1276
01:22:08,204 --> 01:22:09,704
<i>Paper have any mistakes in it?<i>

1277
01:22:09,728 --> 01:22:11,328
<i>Not that I noticed.<i>

1278
01:22:11,352 --> 01:22:13,852
<i>Oh, you can have your coffee
when you want it, Charles.<i>

1279
01:22:14,976 --> 01:22:16,976
Don't forget, it's Emily's birthday.

1280
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,700
Did you remember to get her anything?

1281
01:22:18,724 --> 01:22:20,224
Got it right here.

1282
01:22:20,248 --> 01:22:22,848
Where's my girl?
Where's my birthday girl?

1283
01:22:22,872 --> 01:22:25,672
<i>Don't interrupt her now, Charles.
You can see her at breakfast.<i>

1284
01:22:25,696 --> 01:22:27,696
<i>She's slow enough as it is.<i>

1285
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:31,820
I can't bear it!

1286
01:22:34,844 --> 01:22:37,044
Why did they ever have to get old?

1287
01:22:39,868 --> 01:22:42,568
Mama, I'm here.

1288
01:22:42,592 --> 01:22:44,592
I'm grown up!

1289
01:22:45,816 --> 01:22:47,816
Oh, I love you all.

1290
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,840
Everything.

1291
01:22:50,864 --> 01:22:53,364
I can't look at everything hard enough.

1292
01:22:56,888 --> 01:22:58,488
Hurry up, children!
It's 7:00.

1293
01:22:58,512 --> 01:23:00,512
I don't want to call you again!

1294
01:23:08,836 --> 01:23:10,836
Morning, Mama.

1295
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:15,760
Well, now, dear, a happy birthday to my
girl and many happy returns.

1296
01:23:15,784 --> 01:23:17,784
A surprise is waiting for ya
on the table there.

1297
01:23:17,808 --> 01:23:19,808
Oh, Mama, you shouldn't have!

1298
01:23:19,832 --> 01:23:21,832
I can't...I can't!

1299
01:23:21,856 --> 01:23:23,656
Birthday or no birthday,

1300
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,480
I want you to eat your breakfast
good and slow.

1301
01:23:25,504 --> 01:23:27,504
I want you to grow up
and be a good, strong girl.

1302
01:23:27,528 --> 01:23:30,028
That in the blue package
is from your Aunt Carrie.

1303
01:23:30,852 --> 01:23:31,952
Good morning.

1304
01:23:31,976 --> 01:23:32,976
George!

1305
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,200
<i>Good morning, George.<i>

1306
01:23:34,224 --> 01:23:36,024
I brought this over
for your birthday, Emily.

1307
01:23:36,048 --> 01:23:37,848
Many happy returns of the day.

1308
01:23:37,872 --> 01:23:39,072
Thank you.

1309
01:23:39,096 --> 01:23:40,996
It's only a photograph album.

1310
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:43,020
Oh, George, I'd forgotten.

1311
01:23:43,044 --> 01:23:45,044
It's beautiful!

1312
01:23:45,468 --> 01:23:47,468
Oh, it's just an album.

1313
01:23:48,092 --> 01:23:50,792
I'm going out to
my Uncle Luke's farm today.

1314
01:23:50,816 --> 01:23:52,316
I like it out there.

1315
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:55,940
George, we grew up and were married,
don't you remember!?

1316
01:23:55,964 --> 01:23:58,664
Uncle Luke gave you the farm!

1317
01:23:58,888 --> 01:24:00,188
Well, good-bye.

1318
01:24:00,212 --> 01:24:02,612
Good-bye and thanks.

1319
01:24:03,336 --> 01:24:05,536
Chew this good and slow.

1320
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:07,560
It'll help keep you warm on a cold day.

1321
01:24:09,784 --> 01:24:11,584
Mama.

1322
01:24:11,608 --> 01:24:14,808
Just look at me for one minute
as though you really saw me!

1323
01:24:15,932 --> 01:24:17,932
Mama.

1324
01:24:17,956 --> 01:24:19,756
Twelve years have gone by!

1325
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:21,780
I'm dead!

1326
01:24:22,804 --> 01:24:24,804
I married George Gibbs, Mama!

1327
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:28,328
Wally's dead too.

1328
01:24:28,352 --> 01:24:31,852
Mama, his appendix burst
on a camping trip to Crawford Notch!

1329
01:24:31,876 --> 01:24:35,276
We felt just terrible about it,
don't you remember?

1330
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:41,100
Just for a moment, now, we're all together.

1331
01:24:41,824 --> 01:24:44,824
Mama, let's be happy, just for a moment.

1332
01:24:45,848 --> 01:24:47,848
Let's look at one another!

1333
01:24:49,872 --> 01:24:52,372
<i>That in the yellow package is something
I found in the attic...<i>

1334
01:24:52,396 --> 01:24:53,596
<i>among your grandmother's things.<i>

1335
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:56,920
<i>You're old enough to wear it,
and I thought you'd like it.<i>

1336
01:24:56,944 --> 01:24:58,844
<i>Oh, and this is from you!<i>

1337
01:24:58,868 --> 01:25:00,568
<i>It's lovely.<i>

1338
01:25:00,592 --> 01:25:03,592
<i>It's just what I wanted!
It's beautiful.<i>

1339
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:05,616
<i>I hoped you'd like it.<i>

1340
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,540
<i>Wally has a present for you too.<i>

1341
01:25:07,564 --> 01:25:10,864
<i>He made it at manual training class.
Be sure and make a fuss over it.<i>

1342
01:25:10,888 --> 01:25:13,388
Your father's got a surprise for you too.

1343
01:25:13,712 --> 01:25:15,712
I don't know what it is myself.

1344
01:25:16,836 --> 01:25:18,336
There he comes.

1345
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:20,860
<i>Where's my girl?
Where's my birthday girl?<i>

1346
01:25:21,384 --> 01:25:23,684
I can't...I can't go on!!!

1347
01:25:29,308 --> 01:25:31,808
It goes so fast.

1348
01:25:34,332 --> 01:25:36,832
We don't have time to look at one another.

1349
01:25:44,356 --> 01:25:46,356
I didn't realize.

1350
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:56,380
All that was going on...
and we never noticed.

1351
01:26:00,304 --> 01:26:02,804
Must I go back to my grave?

1352
01:26:02,828 --> 01:26:04,828
Wait.

1353
01:26:06,352 --> 01:26:08,352
One more look.

1354
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:14,376
Good-bye.

1355
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:18,300
Good-bye, world!

1356
01:26:20,324 --> 01:26:22,324
Good-bye, Grover's Corners.

1357
01:26:22,948 --> 01:26:24,948
Mama...Papa.

1358
01:26:27,272 --> 01:26:29,772
Good-bye to clocks ticking...

1359
01:26:30,396 --> 01:26:33,396
my butternut tree,
and Mama's sunflowers.

1360
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:39,320
Food and coffee and new-ironed dresses...

1361
01:26:39,344 --> 01:26:44,344
and hot baths and sleeping and waking up!

1362
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:49,868
Oh, earth, you're too wonderful
for anybody to realize!

1363
01:26:52,392 --> 01:26:55,992
Do any human beings ever realize life
while they live it?

1364
01:26:56,016 --> 01:26:58,516
Every, every minute.

1365
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:02,340
Oh, I want to live,
I want to live, I want to live!

1366
01:27:02,364 --> 01:27:04,364
Of course you do, Emily, of course.

1367
01:27:46,388 --> 01:27:49,388
Most everybody's asleep
in Grover's Corners.

1368
01:27:49,412 --> 01:27:51,412
Oh, there are a few lights on.

1369
01:27:53,336 --> 01:27:55,336
Down at the depot, Shorty Hawkins
has just watched...

1370
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,360
the Albany train go by.

1371
01:27:57,984 --> 01:28:01,384
And of course,
out in George and Emily's farm,

1372
01:28:01,408 --> 01:28:02,908
<i>they're still up.<i>

1373
01:28:02,932 --> 01:28:04,932
<i>Talking over the new baby, I suppose.<i>

1374
01:28:05,456 --> 01:28:09,356
<i>It's like what one of those
Midwestern poets said,<i>

1375
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:11,380
<i>"You gotta love life to have life,<i>

1376
01:28:11,404 --> 01:28:14,404
<i>and you gotta have life to love life."<i>

1377
01:28:24,328 --> 01:28:27,328
Eleven o'clock in Grover's Corners.

1378
01:28:27,352 --> 01:28:30,352
Tomorrow will be another day.

1379
01:28:30,376 --> 01:28:33,376
Everybody's resting in Grover's Corners.

1380
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:35,400
You get a good rest too.

1381
01:28:45,324 --> 01:28:46,824
Good night.
