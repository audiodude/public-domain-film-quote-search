Well, Smithers,
what's on your mind this mornin'?

680
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:59,186
Remember what I told ya when you
slapped that last tax on coffee -

681
00:45:59,186 --> 00:46:01,257
that you were cuttin'
your own bloomin' throat?

682
00:46:01,257 --> 00:46:03,986
Sure. I remembers.
What of it?

683
00:46:03,986 --> 00:46:06,722
There was a riot
down on the village last night...

684
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:10,322
and your tax collector got beaten up
so his own mother wouldn't know 'im.

685
00:46:10,322 --> 00:46:13,699
Oh, that's old stuff.
My army's got them niggers already.

00:46:13,699 --> 00:46:17,103
And I'm gonna dress 'em down
before the whole court this mornin'.

- They all needs a lesson.
- Too late to give 'em a lesson now, me lad.

688

You've got 'em squeezed dry.

Look a-here. When I takes this job,
what I tells ya?

690
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:30,745
I says three years for my cleanup,
don't I?

691
00:46:30,745 --> 00:46:33,687
Well, we's got six months to go.

they ain't no chain gangs and no jim crow...

697
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:55,009
In six months,
