00:01:46,544 --> 00:01:49,878
<i>I'm Sindbad the sailor
So hearty and hale</i>

2
00:01:50,048 --> 00:01:53,040
<i>I live on an island
On the back of a whale</i>

3
00:01:53,218 --> 00:01:54,913
<i>It's a whale of an island</i>

4
00:01:54,986 --> 00:01:56,750
<i>That's not a bad joke</i>

5
00:01:56,921 --> 00:02:00,482
<i>Its lord and its master
Is this handsome bloke</i>

6
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,990
<i>Who's the most remarkable
Extraordinary fellow?</i>

7
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:10,829
<i>Sindbad the sailor!</i>

8
00:02:11,102 --> 00:02:14,094
<i>I scare all creation on land or on sea</i>

9
00:02:14,172 --> 00:02:16,971
<i>But talk about women
They all fall for me</i>

10
00:02:17,042 --> 00:02:19,841
<i>I take my adventures
Wherever they're found</i>

11
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:23,948
<i>I don't wanna brag, folks
But I've been around</i>

12
00:02:24,116 --> 00:02:29,596
<i>Who's the most phenomenal
Extra-special kind of fellow?</i>

13
00:02:30,856 --> 00:02:34,013
<i>Sindbad the sailor</i>

14
00:02:34,693 --> 00:02:37,856
<i>From the valley of serpents
These diamonds I took</i>

15
00:02:38,029 --> 00:02:41,522
<i>I clean out those serpents
With one dirty look</i>

16
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:44,667
Serpents.

17
00:02:50,175 --> 00:02:53,693
<i>Now look at this monster
So strong and so huge</i>

18
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,112
<i>He'd frighten King Kong
But he's only my stooge</i>

19
00:02:58,283 --> 00:03:01,644
<i>The capture of Boola
For me was just fun</i>

20
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,202
<i>Whoever said two heads
Were better than one?</i>

21
00:03:16,768 --> 00:03:21,597
<i>Who's the most phenomenal
Extraordinary fellow?</i>

22
00:03:21,673 --> 00:03:25,515
You, Simlaut the sailor!

23
00:03:30,115 --> 00:03:34,213
How you like that? Stooges.

24
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:40,654
<i>On one of my travels
I ran into this</i>

25
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:44,033
<i>Now, there was a thrill
I'd be sorry to miss</i>

26
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,957
<i>He spread out his wings
And the sunlight grew dim</i>

27
00:03:49,134 --> 00:03:51,034
<i>He took me in his feet</i>

28
00:03:51,303 --> 00:03:54,466
<i>But I ran off with him</i>

29
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,938
<i>Who's the most remarkable
Extraordinary fellow?</i>

30
00:04:01,413 --> 00:04:04,283
<i>Sindbad the sailor</i>

31

33
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,898
<i>I'm afraid of nobody under the sun</i>

34
00:04:20,232 --> 00:04:24,432
<i>All I say is "boo"
And my enemies run</i>

35
00:04:25,103 --> 00:04:29,267
<i>Who's the most remarkable
Extraordinary fellow?</i>

36
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,738
<i>It's Popeye the sailor man</i>

37
00:04:33,511 --> 00:04:36,606
<i>Popeye the sailor man</i>

38
00:04:36,782 --> 00:04:39,879
<i>I'm strong to the finish
'Cause I eats me spinach</i>

<i>I'm Popeye the sailor man</i>

40
00:04:43,522 --> 00:04:46,781
<i>I'm one tough gazooka
Which hates all palookas</i>

41
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,259
<i>What ain't on the up and square</i>

42
00:04:50,429 --> 00:04:53,831
<i>I biffs an' I bops 'em
An' always out-roughs ‘em</i>

00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:57,264
<i>But none of 'em gets nowhere</i>

44
00:04:57,436 --> 00:05:00,565
<i>If anyone dasses
To risk me fist</i>

45
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:04,334
<i>It's bop and it's wham, understand?</i>

46
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,510
<i>So keep good behavior
That's your one lifesaver</i>

47
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,709
<i>With Popeye the sailor man</i>

48
00:05:10,883 --> 00:05:13,680
<i>Oh, I'm Popeye the sailor man</i>

49
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,890
<i>Popeye the sailor man</i>

50

<i>I'm Popeye the swag whaler man</i>

52
00:05:25,498 --> 00:05:27,796
Who fouls the air with a note so sour

53
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:30,402
and dares to challenge Sindbad's...

54
00:05:32,138 --> 00:05:35,655
Why, I'll fix him.

55
00:05:45,552 --> 00:05:47,162
Wreck that ship.

56
00:05:51,825 --> 00:05:54,626
But bring me the woman.

57
00:05:58,098 --> 00:05:59,598
Go.

58
00:06:58,058 --> 00:07:00,993
Oh! Oh! Wh-what happened?

59
00:07:04,264 --> 00:07:07,599
He-he-help! Popeye!

60
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:10,434
Oh, let me go. Let me go.
Let me go!

61
00:07:10,504 --> 00:07:11,994
No, no, no. Don't let me go. Don't.

62
00:07:12,072 --> 00:07:14,422
Oh, man the lifeboats.

63
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,842
Well, that was a nice ship we had once.

64
00:07:19,012 --> 00:07:20,872
Hey, did you see the same thing I saw?

65
00:07:20,981 --> 00:07:23,582
I'm gonna take another look at
that thing. See what that was.

66
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,918
That's the biggest buzzard I ever saw.
Look at that fellow go.

67
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,322
- Where am I?
- Hello there, sweetheart.

68
00:07:32,492 --> 00:07:35,819
- Let me see here, sweetie--
- Hey, keep away from me, you.

69
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:38,124
- Stop that. Let me alone.
- Come on.

70
00:07:38,298 --> 00:07:41,791
Ah, don't do that!
I'll slap you which way.

71
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:43,095
- Come here.
- I won't.

72
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,607
- Get up sugar, and give us a little smack.
- I'll give you a smack, all right. There.

73
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:50,036
Hey, we gotta save Olive Oyl.

74
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,044
Come on, Wimpy. Hurry up
before it's too late. Into the brink.

75
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:08,563
End of the line, everybody off.

76
00:08:09,331 --> 00:08:10,856
Oh, what's this?

77
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,058
"The Isle of Sindbad. Enter not.

78
00:08:13,235 --> 00:08:16,671
For whoso-ever passeth in,
passeth out. Sindbad."

79
00:08:16,838 --> 00:08:19,877
Is this so? Somebody probably
trying to be funny around here.

80
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:23,674
Ooh! Luncheon.

81
00:08:31,754 --> 00:08:35,019
Well, here I go within it.

82
00:08:39,194 --> 00:08:42,129
I don't like this place at all. Ooh.

83
00:08:42,664 --> 00:08:45,065
Sorry I ever came in here.

84
00:08:45,767 --> 00:08:48,371
Looks kind of spooky to me around here.

85
00:08:48,637 --> 00:08:50,230
What's this?

86
00:08:52,207 --> 00:08:54,574
Oh! Oh, yeah?

87
00:08:56,144 --> 00:08:58,838
Oh! Trying to scare me like that, huh?

88
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:07,101
Watch them dumb aminals try
to scare me like that. How about that?

89
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:11,418
- Help! Popeye, save me!
- Oh!

90
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:15,742
Oh, I'm coming, Olive.
I just got a little wall here.

91
00:09:19,635 --> 00:09:22,296
Do I hear footprints somewhere? Oh!

92
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:30,171
I wanna stop. I wanna stop this dancing.

93
00:09:30,312 --> 00:09:31,438
Stop!

94
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:33,081
Huh?

95
00:09:33,549 --> 00:09:35,444
- Oh, Popeye!
- Come back here.

96
00:09:37,186 --> 00:09:39,118
- Who invited you?
- I did.

97
00:09:39,188 --> 00:09:41,213
What are you gonna do about it, huh?

98
00:09:44,593 --> 00:09:46,745
How did you get in here?

99
00:09:52,368 --> 00:09:54,427
Fowled again. Hmm.

100
00:09:54,603 --> 00:09:57,564
I must resort to my last hamburger.

101
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:00,265
Oh! Huh?

102
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,410
Hey, I wants me goil.

103
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:04,944
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

104
00:10:05,114 --> 00:10:06,513
Who are you?

105
00:10:06,682 --> 00:10:09,403
I'm Popeye the sailor man.

106
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:11,380
Who are you?

107
00:10:11,554 --> 00:10:12,851
- Who am I?
- You heard what I said.

108
00:10:12,922 --> 00:10:14,421
- Who am I?
- That's what I said.

109
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,982
Why-- Argh!

110
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:22,288
<i>Who's the most remarkable
Extraordinary fellow?</i>

111
00:10:23,032 --> 00:10:25,062
You.

<i>Who's the most phenomenal
Extra-special kind of fellow?</i>

You.

114
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,369
Is the circus coming here?

115
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,516
<i>I'm afraid of nobody under the sun</i>

118
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:53,825
Who?

119
00:10:53,996 --> 00:10:55,796
- Popeye the sailor.
- What?

120
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:57,729
You better fix your shirt there,
young fellow.

121
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:01,530
- Hey! Hey, let me down.
- Well, let's see how great you are.

122
00:11:01,604 --> 00:11:03,370
Hey, let me down, you big-- Ow!

123
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,338
Whoa! Oh!

124
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:08,170
Oh, what's this?

125
00:11:08,344 --> 00:11:12,338
Hey, let me down,
you big overgrown canary.

126
00:11:13,182 --> 00:11:15,583
What are you doing?
Taking me for a ride or something?

127
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:17,380
Hey, let me go, I says.

128
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:20,079
I'm not going your way.
Come on, let me go. Hey!

129
00:11:20,924 --> 00:11:24,344
Oh, Popeye! Popeye! My Popeye.

130
00:11:26,062 --> 00:11:27,894
Come back to me!

131
00:11:34,337 --> 00:11:36,271
There you are, with gravy.

132
00:11:42,412 --> 00:11:44,573
The old goose is cooked, this guy--

133
00:11:44,647 --> 00:11:46,843
- Hey! Ow!
- Well, I--

134
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:50,350
- Don't you think we better talk this over?
- Try and get out of this one.

135
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,385
Oh my head, my head.

136
00:11:55,191 --> 00:11:56,958
Whoa!

137
00:11:59,528 --> 00:12:03,160
<i>Come, for to sleep
My baby kin</i>

138

<i>I close for you

141
00:12:22,251 --> 00:12:23,380
Oh, my.

142
00:12:23,553 --> 00:12:26,554
Oh, two against one, huh?

143
00:12:26,822 --> 00:12:28,483
How do you like that?

144
00:12:28,557 --> 00:12:31,149
What for you let that
Popeye smack our face?

145
00:12:31,227 --> 00:12:32,854
How do like about that?

146
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:34,846
You hold that Popeye in this hand.

147
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:37,603
By carbonate,
if I had that mug in this hand...

148
00:12:37,766 --> 00:12:40,667
...I make from him special dish
of chopped fricassee.

149
00:12:40,837 --> 00:12:43,304
I don't like chop-you-apart fricassee.

150
00:12:43,372 --> 00:12:45,966
I make for you to like it.

151
00:12:47,844 --> 00:12:50,668
Oh! Why, you two-headed--

152
00:12:54,617 --> 00:12:56,383
How do you like that?

153
00:12:58,554 --> 00:13:00,682
Ow! Ugh!

154
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:03,854
Ugh!

155
00:13:08,898 --> 00:13:11,492
Come on. You're gonna take
a double-header this time.

156
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:12,896
Wham!

157
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:21,034
Well, I guess I fixed those two fellows.
I would hate-- Oh, yeah?

158
00:13:22,178 --> 00:13:25,077
Who's gonna make who
like chicken frica-fricassee, huh?

159
00:13:31,888 --> 00:13:35,374
There's only room for one great sailor
in this world.

160
00:13:35,758 --> 00:13:38,386
And that's me.

161
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:40,407
Oh, says you.

162
00:13:53,609 --> 00:13:55,407
We're gonna come to terms right now.

163
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:12,486
Hey, what are you doing?

164
00:14:12,662 --> 00:14:15,933
Hey, you can't push me just so far.
That's all I gotta say--

165
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:31,342
Beat for beet, kiddo.
That's what I-- Take that!

166
00:14:32,682 --> 00:14:34,650
Whoa! Oh!

167
00:14:37,186 --> 00:14:38,918
Peekaboo!

168
00:14:43,859 --> 00:14:45,389
I sock you!

169
00:14:46,763 --> 00:14:48,462
Come out of there, you!

170
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,769
How do you like that?

171
00:14:57,506 --> 00:14:58,905
Do you give up?

172
00:15:00,676 --> 00:15:02,943
What are you, a fresh guy
or something? I'll show you.

173
00:15:08,717 --> 00:15:10,583
Uh-uh-uh! Don't leave me now.

174
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:41,038
Take that!

175
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:47,319
How do you like that?

176
00:15:50,593 --> 00:15:52,427
Come on, get up and fight.

177
00:15:52,495 --> 00:15:55,493
Give it to him, Popeye.
Give him the twister punch!

178
00:15:55,931 --> 00:15:57,993
Twister punch coming up.

179
00:15:58,801 --> 00:16:00,399
Take that!

180
00:16:06,935 --> 00:16:09,057
You're going places, you golem!

181
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,008
Who's the most remarkable

182
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:15,026
Extraordinary fellow?

183
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:19,440
You, Popeye the sailor!
