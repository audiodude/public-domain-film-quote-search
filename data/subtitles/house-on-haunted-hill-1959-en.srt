I am Watson Pritchard.

In just a minute I'll show you

13
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,733
Since it was built a

me in the morning... I

There'll be food and

00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,065
The hands and feet,
and things like that...

159
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,983
but no heads.

160
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,653
The wife, probably in a rage
threatened her husband with a knife,

161
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,614
and then, carried away by
hysteria took a swing at him,

162
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:21,657
and simply went on from there.

163
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:25,702
Well, she certainly went on. How many
people did she kill, Mr. Pritchard?

164
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,538
Only two. Her husband and her sister.

165
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,040
No one else was here.

166
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,160
So there are two loose heads just
floating around in here somewhere?

167
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,212
You can hear them at night.

168
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:39,660
- They whisper to each other and then cry.
- [LAUGHS]

169
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,301
Since our host isn't here,

170
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,595
would anyone care to mix me a drink?

171
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,167
Certainly, what will you have?

172
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:47,600
<i>[DOOR OPENING]</i>

173
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,633
Good evening.

174
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,857
I'm your host, Frederick Loren.

175
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,235
Since we're all strangers
to each other,

176
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,987
let's get acquainted
with a drink, shall we?

177
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,605
Mr. Loren.

178
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,908
I advise you to call
this party off now.

179
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,703
The ghosts are already
moving and that's a bad sign.

180
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,706
Let me apologize for my wife.
She will join us later.

181
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,082
- What do we have?
- Scotch with ice.

182
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,360
- Doctor?
- I'll have the same.

183
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,546
Now before the party begins,

184
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,798
let's go over the details.

185
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,134
The caretakers will
leave at midnight,

186
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:26,085
locking us in here until they
come back in the morning.

187
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,254
Once the door is locked,
there is no way out.

188
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:32,936
The windows have bars that
a jail would be proud of.

189
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:36,773
And the only door to the
outside locks like a vault.

190
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,483
There is no electricity,

191
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,985
no phone,

192
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,404
no one within miles,

193
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:45,228
so, no way to call for help.

194
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,560
Like a coffin.

195
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,081
So, if any of you decide
not to stay for the party

196
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,542
you must let me know before midnight.

197
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:59,838
Of course if you leave, I shan't
be able to pay you anything.

198
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,415
I'm interest in your
reason for this... party.

199
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,421
Besides some pleasant company.

200
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,182
Ghosts, doctor.

201
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,018
I think everyone wonders
what they would do...

202
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,092
if they saw a ghost.

203
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,690
And now my wife is giving us
all the opportunity to find out.

204
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,028
[CHUCKLES]
Amusing. Ghosts, etc...

205
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,364
being only creations of hysteria...

206
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,893
your party should be a success.

207
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,952
So Pritchard here promises
us genuine ghosts.

208
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,696
Seven now,

209
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,612
maybe more before morning.

210
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,860
That's cheerful.

211
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,706
4 men have been murdered this house.

212
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,256
And 3 women.

213
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,634
You planned your party
very well, Mr. Loren.

214
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,584
4 of us are men, 3 are women,

215
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,998
there's a ghost for everybody.

216
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,892
So Pritchard, why don't you take
us on a tour through the house...

217
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,546
and let's see what happens, uh.

218
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,560
PRITCHARD: See that stain?

219
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,646
Blood.

220
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,229
A young girl was killed here.

221
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,456
And whatever got her wasn't human.
Don't stand there!

222
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,325
What do you mean? Where?

223
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,680
It's too late. They've marked you.

224
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,433
Ridiculous. The roof probably leaks.

225
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,519
Oh, that must be what it is.
Who would want to haunt me?

226
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,021
I would say any
self-respecting male ghost.

227
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,857
I hope it doesn't come back.

228
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,192
Oh Mr. Pritchard,
you are the life of the party.

229
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,986
Oh, he hasn't even started yet.

230
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:49,906
Wasn't there a man who threw his
wife into a wine vat or something?

231
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,283
That was in the cellar.

232
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,654
There's been a murder almost
every place in this house.

233
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:13,255
All this belonged to a Mr. Norton,

234
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:17,259
who didn't die here.
He was electrocuted later.

235
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:24,308
Mr. Norton did a good deal
of experimenting with wines.

236
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,811
But his wife didn't
think it was any good.

237
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:32,282
So he filled a vat with
acid and threw her in.

238
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,936
She was supposed to stay down,

239
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,943
but the bones came up.

240
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,916
It's a funny thing,

241
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:44,537
but none of the murders
here were just ordinary.

242
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:48,203
Just shooting or stabbing...

243
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:51,551
They've all been sort of wild...

244
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:56,048
- violent and different.
- Look out!

245
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,142
Thank God, she didn't fall in.

246
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,921
You mean there's still acid in there?

247
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,451
Destroys everything
with hair and flesh.

248
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,084
Just leaves the bones.

249
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,928
My, it's dry and dusty down here.

250
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:53,390
Because there is a cure
for that, that stinks, come on.

251
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,534
How did you get
invited to this party?

252
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:14,994
No. Let them go on.
I mean, what did he tell you?

253
00:18:16,685 --> 00:18:21,308
[SIGHS] Mr. Loren said everybody
would get 10 thousand dollars.

254
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,518
But he didn't say anything
about being locked in?

255
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,795
No.

256
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,480
He just made a deal
with me on the phone.

257
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,804
But nothing about having to stay.

258
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,694
Aren't you going to stay?

259
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:36,349
If I don't, I lose
10 thousand dollars.

260
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,272
I'm going to stay, too.

261
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:43,231
- 10 thousand dollars.
- Yes.

262
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,191
Do you believe in ghosts?

263
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,486
I don't know.

264
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:52,005
Well, I believe in what that doc
says you can spook yourself.

265
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:55,634
Not a complaint, seeing things
that are not really there.

266
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,378
Or were they?

267
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,764
What do you do with your 10 thousand?

268
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,641
If we get it.

269
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,100
What do you mean "if we get it"?

270
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,269
Won't he pay us if we stay?

271
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,397
Oh I'm sure he will.
Ten thousand is no more to him than

272
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,924
a nickel is for us.

273
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,777
We were in a automobile accident.

274
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:17,398
Now I am the only one in the
family who can make any money.

275
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,063
Well, I have never
seen so many doors.

276
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,658
Closet.

277
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,121
Bottles.

278
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,856
Does it go any where?

279
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,231
Lance!

280
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,525
Lance!

281
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,679
Help me! Please!

282
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,597
Lance is gone!

283
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,681
And there's a ghost!

284
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,380
- See what I mean?
- Please come on!

285
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:13,138
Did you say Lance is gone?
Gone where?

286
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,645
We'll have to break it down!
It's locked!

287
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,647
Locked?

288
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,790
Are you all right?

289
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,497
Nothing that money won't cure.

290
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,712
I must... have bumped my head.

291
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,878
The only way you could
bump your head in here,

292
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,377
is to run head on into the wall.

293
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,638
You didn't do that, did you?

294
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,304
Let's get a bandage on that.

295
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,536
I wonder why they didn't kill him?

296
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:10,984
Who?

297
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:15,067
He didn't bump his head,
they hit him.

298
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,076
They?

299
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:40,316
Nora, when you came in,
you said something about a ghost?

300
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,403
- There was something.
- What did it look like?

301
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:48,074
Well, it was wearing a black thing
that went all the way to the floor.

302
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,785
Weren't you a little
frightened at the time?

303
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,358
Oh, yes.

304
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,457
That, Mr. Loren, is hysteria.

305
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,335
Well, then doctor, how do you
explain what happened to Lance?

306
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,238
Was that hysteria too?

307
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,718
You better get that
checked in a day or two.

308
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,211
Thanks, doc.

309
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,887
Wait for me in the hall.

310
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,028
The ghosts are
coming closer, Mr. Loren.

311
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:28,323
You really believe in your
pet ghosts, don't you Pritchard?

312
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:31,193
Before the night's over,
you will too.

313
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,037
- Would you like a drink, Lance?
- No, thanks.

314
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:36,486
I'd like one. Scotsman.

315
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,883
Mr. Loren, are you really going to
pay anyone who stays all night?

316
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,510

477

I think you all remember
the bargain we made

478
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:06,789
about staying all night.
10 thousand dollars apiece.

479

If any of you don't survive,

480
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,961
50 thousand dollars will be
divided amongst the rest of you.

If I should die...

482

You will be paid by my estate.

the outside by the caretakers,

we'll all be forced to to stay
in this house until morning.

485

If any of you decide not to stay...

486
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,771
you must leave with
the caretakers now.

487
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:33,800
You won't have a chance
to change your minds later

488
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:37,069
because there'll be
no way to get out.

you said your sister-in-law

00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:41,363
killed a man and woman
here and cut them up.

You said they found hands and feet,

but they never found any heads.

ought to stay with her.

636
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:19,497
Alright I'll put it, Pritchard!
Why did you come into this room?

637
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,866
- I'm the only one who understands.
- Understands what?

638
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:27,005
Your wife isn't there anymore,
she's already joined them.

639
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:29,799
Now Pritchard, I've had
enough of your spook talk.

640
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,295
Get out you sot, and don't come
back into this room again!

641
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,531
Where is what's her name...?

642
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:11,124
Nora?

643
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:14,928
I didn't disturb her since I
don't think this concerns her.

644
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:16,501
Now you're right.

645
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:19,126
DR. TRENT: Mr. Loren...

646
00:50:19,126 --> 00:50:22,477
isn't there some way
we can get out of this house now?

647
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:25,104
No. None at all.

648
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,856
We could try breaking out.

649
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,931
The only door to the
outside is made of steel.

650
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:33,597
The bars at the windows
are set in solid stone.

651
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,608
We gotta stay.

652
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:40,479
I'm not afraid of
your ghosts, Pritchard.

653
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,574
But I am afraid.

654
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,710
When we came here a few hours ago,

655
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,964
the only thing we had in common was
the 10 thousand dollars we'd get.

656
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:53,663
Now however we share something else.

657
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,794
The death of Mrs. Loren.

658
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:02,585
So far tonight, one of us was
almost killed by a falling chandelier.

659
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,758
One of us was mysteriously slugged.

660
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,429
One of us is being driven to
the brink of absolute hysteria.

661
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,556
And one of us is dead.

662
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:17,191
Were these accidents? Suicide?

663
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,993
And we must stay here
for six more hours?

664
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,361
6 hours?

665
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,318
Six of us.

666
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:28,615
- Time enough.
- Who will be next?

667
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,741
How will it happen?

668
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:34,325
Let me ask you a question doctor.

669
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:37,176
You were the first one
to see my wife dead.

670
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:40,430
Did you also see anything that
she could have climbed up on

671
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:43,084
- and then jumped?
- No.

672
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:45,427
Did any of you?

673
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,302
There was nothing.

674
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,650
How then did she get up there?

675
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:55,987
- So high,
- Exactly, Mr. Loren, how?

676
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:58,031
She couldn't have
pulled herself up there.

677
00:51:58,032 --> 00:52:00,309
She couldn't have
dropped from the ceiling.

678
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:03,104
Do you think your
wife killed herself?

679
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:04,946
No.

680
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,194
She was murdered.

681
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,568
By one of you.

682
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,366
Or you, Mr. Loren.

683
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:20,136
To deliberately kill someone
you must have a reason.

684
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,430
We were all strangers to your wife.

685
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:25,425
Only you had a motive for murder.

686
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:29,755
What husband hasn't at some
time wanted to kill his wife?

687
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:32,315
What husband hasn't had
a thousand opportunities

688
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:35,276
to do it in such a way so
that he'd never be suspected.

689
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,403
I'm not such a fool
as to hang my wife

690
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,113
from a ceiling by a rope.

691
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,615
The fact remains that you

692
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:43,368
or one of us murdered Mrs. Loren.

693
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:46,996
- And that's the matter for the police.
- So, how do we get the police?

694
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,741
That's my point.
We can't until morning.

695
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:51,668
What began as a silly party

696
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:55,004
given by an eccentric,
has now involved us all in murder.

697
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,756
For once Pritchard may be right.

698
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:59,967
If another murder is in the
works, let's stop it now.

699
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,679
- Another murder?
- Why not?

700
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,458
Maybe one of us saw much.

701
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:11,270
Why should even a millionaire want to
give each of us 10 thousand dollars

702
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,815
to spend one night in
a gloomy old house?

703
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:15,900
To see some ghosts and have a party?

704
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,861
- No.
- Have you finished trying me, doctor?

705
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,947
And is the verdict guilty of murder?

706
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:23,032
No, this isn't getting us anywhere.

707
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,368
Somebody killed
Mrs. Loren, we know that.

708
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:28,079
One of us is guilty and the
rest of us are innocent. Okay.

709
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,248
Now what we have to do
for the next six hours

710
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:33,126
is to protect ourselves...
from each other.

711
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:36,129
- Do you really think...?
- I don't think anything.

712
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:38,172
I just know that I'm
going to my room.

713
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,701
And if anybody comes in,
I'll shoot him...

714
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,218
or her.

715
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,720
And if we all stay in our rooms...

716
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:44,721
we'll be safe.

717
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:47,640
Because the innocent will have
no reason to leave his room,

718
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:50,560
and the guilty will admit
his guilt if he or she does.

719
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:54,355
- And we all have guns.
- Then we are all agreed?

720
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:57,509
Oh I wish this night were over.

721
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:02,431
Rooms? Guns?

722
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,893
I tell you it doesn't
make any difference.
