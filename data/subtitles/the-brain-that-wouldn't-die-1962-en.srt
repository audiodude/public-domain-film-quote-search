1
00:00:01,171 --> 00:00:03,043
Woman: Let me die.

2
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:06,288
Let me die.

3
00:02:00,104 --> 00:02:01,227
I should've known
he was as good as dead

4
00:02:01,436 --> 00:02:02,850
when they wheeled him in.

5
00:02:03,475 --> 00:02:04,265
You did everything possible,

6
00:02:04,473 --> 00:02:06,220
everything you could,
Dr. Cortner.

7
00:02:06,762 --> 00:02:07,927
Everything?

8
00:02:08,968 --> 00:02:10,840
Everything except
save my patient.

9
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:14,918
Everything in the books.

10
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:22,616
Now, Dad, do I have
permission to take over

11
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:24,073
and try things my way?

12
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:29,358
The operating room is
no place to experiment.

13
00:02:29,568 --> 00:02:31,480
He's dead;
I can't do any harm.

14
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,059
Very well.

15
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:39,346
The corpse is yours.
Do what you want to do.

16
00:02:39,929 --> 00:02:41,052
All right.

17
00:02:41,885 --> 00:02:43,590
Make an opening into
the chest cavity.

18
00:02:44,382 --> 00:02:46,295
Apply 100 milliamps of
current directly to the heart,

19
00:02:46,504 --> 00:02:49,291
then massage by hand.
I'll handle the brain area.

20
00:02:50,624 --> 00:02:52,287
- By yourself?
- By myself!

21
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:05,612
I've got to work fast,
if it isn't too late.

22
00:04:09,234 --> 00:04:10,939
You talk as if
he's still alive.

23
00:04:11,814 --> 00:04:12,936
Woman: He is!

24
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,974
I just picked up a
faint pulse beat.

25
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:17,930
Keep massaging the heart.

26
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:19,511
I am, I am.

27
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:21,967
These electric shocks
should stimulate

28
00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:24,089
the motor area enough to
enervate the heart again.

29
00:04:24,673 --> 00:04:26,627
Then he won't need
any external stimuli.

30
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,582
Keep away from
the motor area.

31
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,538
You'll paralyze him for good.

32
00:04:31,747 --> 00:04:34,118
Which would you rather be:
Paralyzed or dead?

33
00:04:34,327 --> 00:04:35,700
Don't try to play God.

34
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:38,529
Some choices are
not yours to make.

35
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:40,694
When the obstetrician
has to decide which to save,

36
00:04:40,902 --> 00:04:43,023
the mother or the child,
who plays God then?

37
00:04:43,856 --> 00:04:44,771
It's part of the game.

38
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,353
The game?

39
00:04:46,977 --> 00:04:50,348
The human body is not a jigsaw
puzzle to experiment on.

40
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,761
Still playing it safe
like the other doctors, hmm?

41
00:04:53,719 --> 00:04:56,423
Might as well save my breath.
Keep massaging the heart.

42
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:58,380
You've already lost
your patient, doctor.

43
00:04:58,588 --> 00:05:00,127
I'm going to save mine.

44
00:05:00,336 --> 00:05:02,998
Woman: His pulse is coming
back stronger than ever.

45
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,120
It's unbelievable.

46
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,370
Man: Nothing is unbelievable

47
00:05:06,578 --> 00:05:07,909
if you have the
nerve to experiment.

48
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,072
I've been working on
something like this for weeks.

49
00:05:11,614 --> 00:05:13,652
In your laboratory?

50
00:05:14,652 --> 00:05:15,483
I knew this would work,

51
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:16,898
if only I had the opportunity—

52
00:05:17,106 --> 00:05:19,103
You don't conduct
experiments on people.

53
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,683
You should be sure
of the results first.

54
00:05:24,555 --> 00:05:25,595
I am now.

55
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,425
Stop massaging the heart.

56
00:05:29,674 --> 00:05:31,504
Let's see if it can
take over by itself.

57
00:05:46,237 --> 00:05:47,276
All right.

58
00:05:48,234 --> 00:05:49,481
Close up the chest.

59
00:05:50,772 --> 00:05:53,019
I'm about finished
with the cerebral area.

60
00:05:54,726 --> 00:05:55,682
How's his pulse?

61
00:05:55,891 --> 00:05:57,097
Woman: Strong and steady.

62
00:06:15,991 --> 00:06:19,694
Yeah, you
did perform a miracle.

63
00:06:20,943 --> 00:06:23,439
I may not approve of
your methods but...

64
00:06:24,397 --> 00:06:26,394
I am proud of your results.

65
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,183
That was an amazing...

66
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:04,138
Even an extraordinary
operation, son.

67
00:07:05,553 --> 00:07:06,718
But it still is too risky.

68
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,341
Too uncontrolled.

69
00:07:09,548 --> 00:07:10,962
Saved his life.

70
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,041
And the aftereffects,
what about them?

71
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,786
You've lost the
urge to experiment.

72
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,242
To explore.

73
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,520
You don't explore on people.

74
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,142
Before you put a scalpel to one,

75
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,680
an operation like this needs
testing under every condition.

76
00:07:37,347 --> 00:07:39,177
Over and over again.

77
00:07:40,135 --> 00:07:42,381
Rabbits, mice, monkeys!

78
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,963
Not people!

79
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,418
That man who should be
dead now won't think so.

80
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,414
There's more to
surgery than just being

81
00:07:49,623 --> 00:07:51,786
a carpenter to patch up walls.

82
00:07:51,996 --> 00:07:53,617
Or a plumber to drain pipes.

83
00:07:54,992 --> 00:07:56,822
Our bodies are capable
of adjusting in ways

84
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,528
we've hardly dreamt of.

85
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,315
If we can only find the key.

86
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,978
I'm so close now,
so very close.

87
00:08:06,893 --> 00:08:08,266
The key to what?

88
00:08:08,474 --> 00:08:10,097
Complete transplantations.

89
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:13,634
To be able to transplant
limbs and organs.

90
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:16,879
To be able to replace
diseased and damaged parts

91
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:19,959
of the body as easily as
we replace eye corneas now.

92
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,914
So that the new parts will
join together as though

93
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:24,703
they were born there.

94
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:27,325
It can't be done!

95
00:08:28,865 --> 00:08:30,113
It can be done!

96
00:08:35,108 --> 00:08:36,563
With my new special
compound I've created,

97
00:08:36,772 --> 00:08:37,978
I'll do it,
I know I can do it!

98
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:39,768
Sure, sure,
that's what you say!

99
00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:41,016
That's what I know!

100
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:42,390
I know I'm close!

101
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,713
Darling, I'm so proud
of you I could kiss you!

102
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:52,709
Promises, huh?
Always promises.

103
00:08:53,293 --> 00:08:55,290
Careful, your father
is liable to report us.

104
00:08:55,499 --> 00:08:57,703
And stop the floor show?

105
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,285
When you two are
married it won't be fun

106
00:08:59,494 --> 00:09:00,783
to watch anymore.

107
00:09:00,992 --> 00:09:02,406
Well, I can promise
you one thing.

108
00:09:02,615 --> 00:09:05,402
Your grandchildren won't
be test tube babies.

109
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:06,484
You better hurry
if you wanna catch

110
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:08,024
that plane to Denver, Dad.

111
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:09,272
And you know that
medical convention

112
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,853
can't start without you.

113
00:09:11,978 --> 00:09:15,098
Um, Jan, you'd better
check about my reservations.

114
00:09:15,307 --> 00:09:17,927
Oh yes, I'll call the airport.
I'll be right back.

115
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:22,298
Bill.

116
00:09:23,006 --> 00:09:26,251
The line between scientific
genius and obsessive fanaticism

117
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,458
is a thin one.

118
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,414
Now I want you on
the right side of it.

119
00:09:29,622 --> 00:09:31,037
If I don't experiment,
how can I hope to perform

120
00:09:31,245 --> 00:09:33,825
operations like the one
you almost messed up?

121
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:36,571
But I can't cover
up for you anymore.

122
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,901
The superintendent
had it out with me.

123
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,150
He thinks it's you
who's been stealing

124
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:42,730
those limbs from the
amputee operations.

125
00:09:42,939 --> 00:09:44,437
So what if it is?

126
00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:47,349
I've got to have limbs for
my transplant experiments.

127
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:50,054
Well, you said test and experiment,
test and experiment!

128
00:09:50,263 --> 00:09:53,675
Yes, but limbs and
organs taken from people!

129
00:09:53,883 --> 00:09:55,755
I've got to have
them to work with.

130
00:09:57,421 --> 00:09:59,667
Sure, I've made a few mistakes.

131
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:02,330
But I've learned from them,
I've learned!

132
00:10:06,035 --> 00:10:07,782
Your reservations
are all set,

133
00:10:07,991 --> 00:10:09,446
3:30 take off.

134
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:13,732
Well, what have you two
planned for the weekend?

135
00:10:14,316 --> 00:10:15,563
Oh, nothing much.

136
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,769
Just a quiet weekend.

137
00:10:17,979 --> 00:10:18,643
Are you sure
you're not going up

138
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:19,975
to the country house?

139
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,096
You're always
sneaking off up there.

140
00:10:23,846 --> 00:10:25,052
That place gives me the creeps,

141
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:26,883
I should've sold it
when your mother died.

142
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:28,506
You can't sell that place!

143
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:30,628
Well, I mean it's nice to
get away from the city,

144
00:10:30,837 --> 00:10:32,459
I can work without
anyone snooping around.

145
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:34,123
You spent too
much time up there.

146
00:10:35,872 --> 00:10:38,743
All right, I'll see
you both in a few days.

147
00:10:38,953 --> 00:10:40,740
I've got to clean up
and get out of here.

148
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:45,651
Fine operation or not, Bill,

149
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,523
you're walking on thin ice.

150
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:49,604
But don't go too far!

151
00:10:56,263 --> 00:10:58,427
Oh, every time
you touch me

152
00:10:58,636 --> 00:10:59,883
I go out of my mind.

153
00:11:00,758 --> 00:11:01,923
I wanna kiss you.

154
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:04,377
Bill, I wanna get married,

155
00:11:04,587 --> 00:11:06,416
I can't stand not having you!

156
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,497
You've been wonderful!

157
00:11:08,706 --> 00:11:10,120
Oh, I'd rather be a bride.

158
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,534
In a few more weeks.

159
00:11:13,742 --> 00:11:15,405
Then nothing will keep us apart.

160
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:17,652
We'll be together.

161
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:31,635
Dr. Cortner!

162
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,085
I'm so glad you're here.

163
00:11:38,294 --> 00:11:39,500
I was afraid you'd gotten away.

164
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:41,373
There is a very
important phone message

165
00:11:41,582 --> 00:11:43,412
that came to you;
it sounded quite urgent.

166
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,493
I have been looking
everywhere.

167
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,782
it was from
a man called Kurt.

168
00:11:46,992 --> 00:11:49,071
He called from
the country place,

169
00:11:49,281 --> 00:11:51,318
and he said something
terrible had happened,

170
00:11:51,528 --> 00:11:53,066
and he wanted you
to come right out.

171
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,147
Thank you.

172
00:11:58,602 --> 00:11:59,724
Well, you've always
wanted to know

173
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:01,847
what's kept me away from
you so many weekends.

174
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,177
Have you got the
keys to your car?

175
00:12:15,747 --> 00:12:18,493
Why haven't you ever
taken me up here before?

176
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:19,242
Because the things
I'm working on

177
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:20,698
don't need
an audience.

178
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:24,069
That telephone call,
what about it?

179
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:26,483
All right, all right,
hold off the questions.

180
00:12:26,983 --> 00:12:30,228
Why the mystery, Bill?
What's this all about?

181
00:12:31,186 --> 00:12:33,474
We'll be there soon
enough, you'll see.

182
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,347
I've got to hurry.

183
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,579
Bill: Kurt? Kurt!

184
00:17:17,826 --> 00:17:18,615
All right, all right!

185
00:17:18,825 --> 00:17:19,656
For God's sake open the door!

186
00:17:19,865 --> 00:17:20,821
I'm coming!

187
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:25,815
What's the matter?

188
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:27,854
What's happened to you?

189
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,185
There's been a
terrible accident.

190
00:17:29,395 --> 00:17:31,224
I've got to save her,
I've got to save her.

191
00:17:31,434 --> 00:17:32,848
What is it,
what have you got there?

192
00:17:33,056 --> 00:17:34,138
Kurt, please!

193
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:35,760
Sterilize the tubes and
instruments, quickly!

194
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,134
Well what are
you going to do?

195
00:17:37,343 --> 00:17:38,340
Aren't you going to have a
look in the closet first?

196
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,213
Oh, I can't now,
this is more important.

197
00:17:40,423 --> 00:17:41,461
But you don't understand!

198
00:17:41,671 --> 00:17:42,627
For God's sake,
Kurt, this is urgent,

199
00:17:42,836 --> 00:17:43,750
do as I tell you
before it's too late,

200
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,748
I can't waste precious
time arguing with you!

201
00:19:56,501 --> 00:19:57,749
The eyelids!

202
00:19:58,415 --> 00:19:59,704
I saw them move!

203
00:20:01,745 --> 00:20:03,200
It can't be!

204
00:20:05,822 --> 00:20:07,778
My eyes are deceiving me.

205
00:20:08,985 --> 00:20:10,441
What you see is real.

206
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:13,937
What's done is done and
what I've done is right.

207
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,849
It's the work of science.

208
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:29,168
I remember...

209
00:20:30,084 --> 00:20:31,165
Fire.

210
00:20:35,036 --> 00:20:36,325
Burning.

211
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:42,983
Let me die.

212
00:20:46,605 --> 00:20:48,269
Let me die.

213
00:20:50,892 --> 00:20:52,346
I've had success
with transplants,

214
00:20:52,556 --> 00:20:54,094
now I can do it for her.

215
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,587
Transplant her onto what?

216
00:21:01,378 --> 00:21:03,416
I brought her back,
she'll live,

217
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,247
and I'll get her another body.

218
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:07,703
I can make her complete again.

219
00:21:08,994 --> 00:21:11,198
Only a madman can believe

220
00:21:11,407 --> 00:21:13,195
that she could ever
be like before!

221
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,569
Don't argue with me.

222
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:18,148
I love her too much to
let her stay like this.

223
00:21:18,939 --> 00:21:20,562
I'll restore her as before.

224
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,017
You'll see.

225
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:24,557
Can't you realize?

226
00:21:24,765 --> 00:21:26,054
Can't you see?

227
00:21:26,264 --> 00:21:28,510
There's a pattern
to all that lives!

228
00:21:28,718 --> 00:21:30,424
An order,
an arrangement.

229
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:33,129
She had a heart,
and a brain,

230
00:21:33,338 --> 00:21:34,585
and her spirit was in both,

231
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:35,959
not in one
or the other!

232
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:37,207
No.

233
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:40,203
I'll give her a
brain and a heart.

234
00:21:40,413 --> 00:21:42,367
Yes, and what of her soul?

235
00:21:44,615 --> 00:21:46,196
You say you love her and...

236
00:21:46,946 --> 00:21:48,734
you can remember
her love for you.

237
00:21:49,734 --> 00:21:52,937
Then how can you make of
her an experiment of horror?

238
00:21:54,353 --> 00:21:57,182
All the skill and science
I possess was meant for this.

239
00:21:58,473 --> 00:21:59,804
Life has a pattern.

240
00:22:00,762 --> 00:22:02,300
The whole pattern of my
life is shaping itself

241
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,882
to save her now.

242
00:22:05,006 --> 00:22:06,129
Then you intend to
go through with it?

243
00:22:06,338 --> 00:22:07,169
Yes.

244
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:12,662
Sleep, my darling.

245
00:22:14,203 --> 00:22:15,784
Rest and grow stronger.

246
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:31,222
How long do you think
we can keep her alive

247
00:22:31,432 --> 00:22:32,803
under these conditions?

248
00:22:33,512 --> 00:22:37,049
48, 50 hours
at the most.

249
00:22:37,257 --> 00:22:38,255
Yes.

250
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,293
And you really
believe you can work

251
00:22:41,502 --> 00:22:42,999
a transplant on her?

252
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,413
Successfully?

253
00:22:45,622 --> 00:22:46,536
Yes.

254
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:49,907
Like my arm?

255
00:22:51,282 --> 00:22:53,070
Withered and deformed.

256
00:22:54,153 --> 00:22:56,357
Yours was an early
experiment that failed.

257
00:22:57,773 --> 00:22:59,853
With her I'm using
my new Adreno-Serum.

258
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:01,892
It must work.

259
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:06,095
I...
I've got to go now.

260
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,880
If the police,
or anyone, call,

261
00:23:12,297 --> 00:23:14,002
tell them you don't
know anything about it.

262
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,499
I don't think anyone
will trace us here

263
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:19,121
because her body was
burned in the wreckage.

264
00:23:19,329 --> 00:23:20,994
Yes, yes,
of course, of course.

265
00:23:21,202 --> 00:23:22,741
Look, Bill,
before you go,

266
00:23:23,491 --> 00:23:24,863
do have a look in that closet.

267
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:26,902
It's the reason why
I called you up here.

268
00:24:17,465 --> 00:24:18,879
Keep it locked!

269
00:24:19,629 --> 00:24:21,833
Last night it go so violent,
it almost broke out!

270
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,873
Oh, no, not through that thickness.

271
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:25,370
Keep it closed.

272
00:24:31,822 --> 00:24:33,735
I've got to think about her now.

273
00:24:36,815 --> 00:24:38,562
I've got to find her a body.

274
00:24:38,771 --> 00:24:40,518
How are you going to
go about getting one?

275
00:24:45,263 --> 00:24:46,719
Bill, how will you do it?

276
00:24:48,135 --> 00:24:49,591
There are ways.

277
00:24:53,045 --> 00:24:54,376
There are ways.

278
00:29:33,734 --> 00:29:35,232
What took you so long?

279
00:29:36,023 --> 00:29:37,395
What made you
think I'd come?

280
00:29:37,604 --> 00:29:39,850
You know a good
thing when you see it.

281
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,598
Yeah, there was plenty to see.

282
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,720
I liked your act.

283
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,427
Is that all you liked?

284
00:29:45,636 --> 00:29:47,591
Well your costume,
what there was of it,

285
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,839
was interesting.

286
00:29:49,048 --> 00:29:50,046
Is that all?

287
00:29:51,295 --> 00:29:53,083
The rest of the
equipment is standard.

288
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,285
But, uh, the arrangement
is pretty special.

289
00:30:00,242 --> 00:30:02,988
You're no tourist just
looking at the sights.

290
00:30:03,197 --> 00:30:05,526
What are you doing
here, slumming?

291
00:30:05,736 --> 00:30:07,274
Oh, I get my
allowance once a week.

292
00:30:07,484 --> 00:30:10,728
Okay, if you're so loaded,
you pay for the drinks.

293
00:30:10,937 --> 00:30:12,268
I already did.

294
00:30:13,226 --> 00:30:14,515
Are you hustling for the house?

295
00:30:14,724 --> 00:30:16,013
I hustle for myself.

296
00:30:20,176 --> 00:30:22,131
I'm the leading
lady around here,

297
00:30:22,339 --> 00:30:24,502
I can sit with
the squares out front

298
00:30:24,712 --> 00:30:28,456
or I can relax back
here with my friends.

299
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:31,202
I'll bet you you don't
have an enemy in the world.

300
00:30:32,202 --> 00:30:33,075
Hmm?

301
00:30:47,683 --> 00:30:49,221
Let me die.

302
00:30:57,212 --> 00:30:58,584
Let me die.

303
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,992
Where are you from?

304
00:31:06,201 --> 00:31:07,157
Oh, around.

305
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:08,697
Just looking around.

306
00:31:09,364 --> 00:31:12,858
When you get done
looking, then what?

307
00:31:13,401 --> 00:31:14,606
I operate.

308
00:31:14,816 --> 00:31:17,644
I get your message;
you're coming across.

309
00:31:19,102 --> 00:31:22,929
You could flip any chick
in the house; why me?

310
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,550
Well, like I said,
I'm looking.

311
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,881
Well, you don't have
to look any further.

312
00:31:28,091 --> 00:31:29,921
I'm not gonna fake it for you.

313
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,958
When do you go
on again, huh, when?

314
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:36,121
Relax, I got another show yet.

315
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,077
But it could be for you.

316
00:31:38,286 --> 00:31:39,949
Oh, I was just asking.

317
00:31:41,906 --> 00:31:43,071
Try taking.

318
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,399
Are you getting nervous?

319
00:31:46,609 --> 00:31:48,189
I'm over 21.

320
00:31:49,521 --> 00:31:50,894
Oh it isn't that, it's...

321
00:31:51,103 --> 00:31:52,434
I've just got things to do.

322
00:31:53,142 --> 00:31:54,640
Things to take care of.

323
00:31:55,222 --> 00:31:56,887
Well, if that's anything
that makes you sick

324
00:31:57,095 --> 00:31:57,926
what could be more important

325
00:31:58,136 --> 00:32:00,590
that could be taken
care of right now?

326
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:03,753
Oh I've, uh,

327
00:32:04,586 --> 00:32:06,458
I've got to see about
helping somebody.

328
00:32:07,915 --> 00:32:09,662
Somebody who needs
my help very badly.

329
00:32:09,871 --> 00:32:11,826
You can't cut out
on me now, baby.

330
00:32:12,035 --> 00:32:14,656
Not when you've got
me feeling so good.

331
00:32:14,865 --> 00:32:16,820
I'm so warm all over.

332
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:19,816
I'm good for you.

333
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:23,021
I know I'm good
for what you want.

334
00:32:23,937 --> 00:32:25,808
You may be just
what I'm looking for.

335
00:32:33,592 --> 00:32:35,504
You've got your nerve.

336
00:32:35,714 --> 00:32:37,335
Oh, look who's talking.

337
00:32:38,835 --> 00:32:39,833
Why don't you haul
your beat-up body

338
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,288
back to the bar with
the rest of the flies?

339
00:32:42,497 --> 00:32:43,744
Keep your g-string on.

340
00:32:43,953 --> 00:32:46,241
I only came in here
to change my clothes.

341
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,656
I got admission.

342
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:50,194
Now I'd like to see
the rest of the show.

343
00:32:50,778 --> 00:32:53,607
Come back in half an
hour and maybe you will.

344
00:32:53,816 --> 00:32:54,980
Get lost.

345
00:32:56,396 --> 00:32:57,602
Hi, loverboy.

346
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,683
I see you've met the queen.

347
00:33:01,806 --> 00:33:02,762
Hey.

348
00:33:04,386 --> 00:33:05,591
Come here, don't hide.

349
00:33:05,801 --> 00:33:07,006
You know you've got
the kind of face

350
00:33:07,216 --> 00:33:08,879
a girl doesn't mind looking at.

351
00:33:09,505 --> 00:33:10,752
Even out front all
the other girls

352
00:33:10,961 --> 00:33:12,209
were asking about you.

353
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,499
Get out of here.

354
00:33:13,707 --> 00:33:15,912
Two's company,
three's a crowd.

355
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:19,449
Who's to tell me to
blow if I don't want to?

356
00:33:19,659 --> 00:33:22,612
This here is my dressing
room too, remember?

357
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:25,317
It kills her to see
me make time.

358
00:33:25,526 --> 00:33:26,940
You're the only thing
that's going to be made

359
00:33:27,149 --> 00:33:29,520
around here tonight, honey.

360
00:33:29,729 --> 00:33:30,935
Eat your heart out.

361
00:33:31,144 --> 00:33:32,766
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

362
00:33:32,975 --> 00:33:34,680
Yeah, well, uh,
I'd better be going, hmm?

363
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:36,553
What for?

364
00:33:36,762 --> 00:33:37,385
Look what you've done!

365
00:33:37,594 --> 00:33:39,508
You come busting in here
with your two cents.

366
00:33:40,341 --> 00:33:41,630
Let me see you later.

367
00:33:42,255 --> 00:33:43,586
I'll make everything up to you,

368
00:33:43,794 --> 00:33:45,042
I swear I will.

369
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:48,163
Yeah, come on back later.

370
00:33:48,372 --> 00:33:49,578
I'll remember you.

371
00:33:50,453 --> 00:33:51,867
Yeah, that's
what I'm afraid of.

372
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,315
You lousy tramp.

373
00:34:00,523 --> 00:34:01,813
Once in a blue moon
I latch onto a guy

374
00:34:02,022 --> 00:34:05,184
with class and you mess it up.

375
00:34:05,392 --> 00:34:06,432
Eh.

376
00:34:06,641 --> 00:34:08,221
What makes you
think you had him?

377
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:10,427
He wouldn't have you on a bet.

378
00:34:10,636 --> 00:34:11,592
Says who?

379
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:13,506
Says me.

380
00:34:13,716 --> 00:34:16,086
What's a guy like that
want with leftovers for?

381
00:34:16,296 --> 00:34:17,501
Leftovers?!

382
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,289
Why, you cheap
third-rate stripper!

383
00:34:25,908 --> 00:34:26,990
Let go!

384
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,273
There.

385
00:34:33,482 --> 00:34:33,981
No!

386
00:34:34,189 --> 00:34:35,479
I'll mash you like a bug.

387
00:34:35,729 --> 00:34:37,873
Don't you cry.
Watch out.

388
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,026
You.

389
00:35:16,193 --> 00:35:17,649
Inside the closet.

390
00:35:19,858 --> 00:35:21,525
What has he done to you?

391
00:35:28,731 --> 00:35:30,604
I know there's someone there.

392
00:35:35,937 --> 00:35:37,727
Knock once if you hear me.

393
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:05,218
Then I'm not the first.

394
00:36:06,552 --> 00:36:08,759
Knock twice if
I'm not the first.

395
00:36:18,298 --> 00:36:20,130
He should've let me die.

396
00:36:23,547 --> 00:36:25,628
I hate him for what
he's done to me.

397
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:30,626
If he only knew what it's
like being like this.

398
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:36,915
Do you know what it's like?

399
00:36:44,373 --> 00:36:46,581
Together we could have revenge.

400
00:36:49,454 --> 00:36:50,869
You want revenge?

401
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:11,946
Yes.

402
00:37:12,947 --> 00:37:16,069
You the thing inside,
and me the thing out here.

403
00:37:18,362 --> 00:37:20,278
My brain is still untouched.

404
00:37:21,111 --> 00:37:23,318
And his keeping me alive
has given me a power

405
00:37:23,527 --> 00:37:24,942
he didn't count on.

406
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:29,357
A power that you can feel.

407
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:33,148
Across this room and
through that door.

408
00:37:34,856 --> 00:37:35,896
Can't you?

409
00:37:58,307 --> 00:38:00,597
Together we're both
more than things.

410
00:38:01,806 --> 00:38:04,720
We're a power as hideous
as our deformities.

411
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:08,386
Together we'll
wreak our revenge.

412
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:13,218
I shall create power

413
00:38:13,803 --> 00:38:15,467
and you will enforce it.

414
00:38:17,801 --> 00:38:19,423
You, the thing inside.

415
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:29,289
Me, the thing out here.

416
00:40:09,515 --> 00:40:11,930
What's locked behind that door?

417
00:40:13,472 --> 00:40:14,678
Horror.

418
00:40:15,596 --> 00:40:17,719
No normal mind can imagine.

419
00:40:17,929 --> 00:40:20,510
Something even more
terrible than you.

420
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:23,134
No, my deformed friend.

421
00:40:24,301 --> 00:40:28,174
Like all quantities,
horror has its ultimate.

422
00:40:28,382 --> 00:40:29,757
And I'm that.

423
00:40:29,966 --> 00:40:31,006
No.

424
00:40:31,465 --> 00:40:33,672
There is a horror beyond yours,

425
00:40:33,882 --> 00:40:35,214
and it's in there.

426
00:40:36,215 --> 00:40:37,962
Locked behind that door.

427
00:40:40,338 --> 00:40:42,586
The paths of experimentation
twist and turn

428
00:40:42,795 --> 00:40:44,418
through mountains
of miscalculation

429
00:40:44,629 --> 00:40:48,292
and often lose themselves
in error and darkness.

430
00:40:49,585 --> 00:40:52,041
Behind that door
is the sum total

431
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:54,124
of Dr. Cortner's mistakes.

432
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:01,246
He had no right to
bring me back to this.

433
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,828
Perhaps not.
Who knows?

434
00:41:07,496 --> 00:41:09,078
But you should know...

435
00:41:10,122 --> 00:41:13,581
that before he injected
the serum into that,

436
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,583
it was but a mass
of grafted tissues.

437
00:41:16,792 --> 00:41:17,751
Lifeless.

438
00:41:18,585 --> 00:41:20,168
It just lay there,
weighted down

439
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:23,753
with its transplants of broken
limbs and amputated arms.

440
00:41:24,422 --> 00:41:26,172
But with this serum,

441
00:41:26,923 --> 00:41:28,757
it began to breathe.

442
00:41:29,258 --> 00:41:30,925
That's impossible.

443
00:41:32,927 --> 00:41:34,176
Would you have
thought possible

444
00:41:34,385 --> 00:41:35,344
what he has already done?

445
00:41:36,553 --> 00:41:38,011
Take yourself.

446
00:41:39,138 --> 00:41:40,347
He has brought you back.

447
00:41:40,555 --> 00:41:41,639
You live!

448
00:41:42,389 --> 00:41:45,682
And only a few years ago,

449
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:48,809
all transplants were impossible.

450
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,311
That's what he's
been doing up here

451
00:41:51,521 --> 00:41:53,395
where no one could see his work?

452
00:41:53,604 --> 00:41:54,647
Yes.

453
00:41:56,273 --> 00:41:58,148
Experimenting with
transplants on that...

454
00:41:59,233 --> 00:42:00,442
and on me.

455
00:42:02,236 --> 00:42:04,609
Letting him
tear away my flesh

456
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:08,154
time after time,
test after test.

457
00:42:09,364 --> 00:42:11,822
My hopes shattering
with each grafted arm

458
00:42:12,032 --> 00:42:13,490
he fastened to me.

459
00:42:14,158 --> 00:42:17,825
Watching it wither and warp.

460
00:42:19,744 --> 00:42:22,245
Instead of strengthening.

461
00:42:24,913 --> 00:42:26,081
Now you see,

462
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:29,333
he's learned from his mistakes.

463
00:42:32,168 --> 00:42:34,168
And you stayed with him.

464
00:42:35,295 --> 00:42:37,128
Helping him in his grotesque work

465
00:42:37,337 --> 00:42:39,170
that he claims is for science.

466
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,464
Was there a place
for me on the outside

467
00:42:42,673 --> 00:42:43,882
with this?

468
00:42:45,217 --> 00:42:47,634
In a world where eyes
would look upon me

469
00:42:47,843 --> 00:42:51,053
with pity and people
would turn away from me

470
00:42:51,262 --> 00:42:52,595
in disgust.

471
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:58,223
No, the alcoholic
has his bottle.

472
00:42:59,641 --> 00:43:01,600
The dope addict his needle.

473
00:43:04,394 --> 00:43:06,226
I had my research.

474
00:43:08,061 --> 00:43:11,143
I used to be a surgeon.
It was my life.

475
00:43:12,811 --> 00:43:14,060
Then one night in
the laboratory,

476
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:17,351
there...
there was an accident.

477
00:43:18,602 --> 00:43:20,476
They had to amputate my arm.

478
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,060
And...

479
00:43:28,143 --> 00:43:29,850
He has used you, too...

480
00:43:31,185 --> 00:43:32,518
I had no choice.

481
00:43:33,102 --> 00:43:34,518
He was my only hope.

482
00:43:35,103 --> 00:43:37,434
A surgeon needs both
his arms, not just one.

483
00:43:39,185 --> 00:43:40,143
Well, you see,

484
00:43:40,352 --> 00:43:43,059
my transplanted
grotesqueness stayed,

485
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:44,560
and so did I.

486
00:43:45,602 --> 00:43:47,685
I live only for the day
he can work a successful

487
00:43:47,893 --> 00:43:49,560
transplant to my body.

488
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:52,017
That is why I stay.

489
00:43:53,352 --> 00:43:54,600
Transplant...

490
00:43:55,811 --> 00:43:57,934
my head onto another body?

491
00:43:59,143 --> 00:44:00,268
Yes.

492
00:44:00,477 --> 00:44:03,059
And he's insane with
the belief he can do it.

493
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,017
But the tissues of
my body would reject

494
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,059
the tissues of another.

495
00:44:09,268 --> 00:44:11,809
Reject it as the
foreign substance it is.

496
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,434
The transplant would
never take,

497
00:44:13,643 --> 00:44:15,475
it would never
stay in place.

498
00:44:16,269 --> 00:44:18,184
My blood's antibodies
would attack it

499
00:44:18,394 --> 00:44:20,350
as they attack any
invading matter.

500
00:44:21,143 --> 00:44:23,350
Yes, but his new discovery,

501
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,226
this new serum,
may change all of that.

502
00:44:28,018 --> 00:44:30,393
This serum,
injected into the bloodstream,

503
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:32,684
affects the lymphoid tissues.

504
00:44:33,726 --> 00:44:35,934
Here in the neck,
the lymphoids

505
00:44:36,143 --> 00:44:37,893
that provide the
antibodies for the blood

506
00:44:38,102 --> 00:44:40,267
that detect foreign
transplanted matter.

507
00:44:41,352 --> 00:44:43,308
It was untested, untried.

508
00:44:44,017 --> 00:44:45,767
Until we used it on you.

509
00:44:46,352 --> 00:44:49,393
So that liquid in the blood

510
00:44:49,601 --> 00:44:52,141
that's being pumped
through what's left of me...

511
00:44:54,685 --> 00:44:56,433
is what makes me feel the...

512
00:45:02,017 --> 00:45:04,976
He may produce results
he didn't ask for.

513
00:45:05,643 --> 00:45:06,808
Results?

514
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:11,102
You mean,
like this?

515
00:45:12,728 --> 00:45:14,979
Results more
terrible than your arm

516
00:45:15,187 --> 00:45:16,729
of relative beauty.

517
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,231
Results of power.

518
00:45:20,315 --> 00:45:21,898
Of magnitude.

519
00:45:22,483 --> 00:45:23,609
Power?

520
00:45:24,317 --> 00:45:25,734
What power?

521
00:45:27,528 --> 00:45:29,278
Can't you see that you're
at the mercy of every

522
00:45:29,486 --> 00:45:31,278
element of the universe?

523
00:45:31,488 --> 00:45:33,488
How can you speak of power?

524
00:45:34,197 --> 00:45:35,822
I have a power.

525
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:38,865
This liquid that's
he's pumped into me,

526
00:45:39,075 --> 00:45:41,117
my brain burns with it.

527
00:45:42,994 --> 00:45:45,244
That thing inside
and I are in touch.

528
00:45:45,954 --> 00:45:47,412
Want me to prove it?

529
00:45:47,621 --> 00:45:49,746
Oh, you can prove nothing.

530
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,622
You're powerless!

531
00:45:52,832 --> 00:45:55,708
I'll show you
how powerless I am.

532
00:45:59,127 --> 00:46:00,210
You.

533
00:46:01,378 --> 00:46:02,794
Behind that door.

534
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,383
Let me know if you hear me.

535
00:46:17,262 --> 00:46:21,137
Whoever,
whatever you are...

536
00:46:22,598 --> 00:46:24,180
I command you.

537
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:28,474
You understand me?

538
00:46:30,934 --> 00:46:34,978
I'm only a head and
you're whatever you are.

539
00:46:37,229 --> 00:46:38,895
Together we're strong!

540
00:46:39,731 --> 00:46:41,856
More powerful than any of them.

541
00:46:54,613 --> 00:46:56,780
What are you running from?
What's wrong with you?

542
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:59,281
Oh, it's you.

543
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,325
There's something wrong,
something beyond control

544
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:03,866
in that room.

545
00:47:04,076 --> 00:47:05,951
There's nothing
beyond my control.

546
00:47:06,161 --> 00:47:06,827
She's alive and
I'll keep her alive

547
00:47:07,036 --> 00:47:08,494
until I find her a body.

548
00:47:10,246 --> 00:47:11,746
I can't talk anymore,
I'm tired,

549
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:12,955
I've got to go to sleep.

550
00:47:13,165 --> 00:47:15,414
Then you...
you didn't find her a body?

551
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:16,831
Well, I've got to be careful.

552
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,540
I can't afford to be
identified as the last person

553
00:47:18,751 --> 00:47:20,626
seen with a girl
before she disappears.

554
00:47:21,085 --> 00:47:22,668
Do you think you'll get one?

555
00:47:27,796 --> 00:47:29,922
There are many things
left for tomorrow.

556
00:48:44,044 --> 00:48:45,752
Hi, I was about to call a cop

557
00:48:45,961 --> 00:48:47,378
the way you were
looking me over.

558
00:48:47,587 --> 00:48:48,504
How have you been, Bill?

559
00:48:48,713 --> 00:48:49,920
Oh, just fine, Donna.

560
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:51,672
I haven't seen you
for quite a while.

561
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:53,340
Too long, I'm still
waiting for that call you

562
00:48:53,548 --> 00:48:54,882
once promised me.

563
00:48:55,092 --> 00:48:56,800
Ah, you know how
it is with interns.

564
00:48:57,008 --> 00:48:58,008
All work.

565
00:48:58,218 --> 00:48:59,551
All work and
no play even makes

566
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,093
for dull doctors.

567
00:49:01,303 --> 00:49:04,387
You're gonna lose that
bedside manner of yours.

568
00:49:05,179 --> 00:49:07,846
Say, how about a little
side course in anatomy?

569
00:49:08,473 --> 00:49:09,722
Yours, anytime!

570
00:49:09,932 --> 00:49:10,723
No, not mine.

571
00:49:10,933 --> 00:49:12,599
A Body Beautiful
contest, you know,

572
00:49:12,809 --> 00:49:15,601
bathing suit models, plenty
of females on the hook.

573
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:18,434
Your eyes will have a
field day, interested?

574
00:49:18,645 --> 00:49:19,727
Oh, why not?

575
00:49:19,937 --> 00:49:21,771
You're just what
the doctor ordered.

576
00:49:21,979 --> 00:49:23,355
Come on, jump in.

577
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:28,232
Ah, on second thought...

578
00:49:28,441 --> 00:49:29,775
I just remembered I've
got to stop by my place

579
00:49:29,983 --> 00:49:30,982
and take care
of a few things.

580
00:49:31,193 --> 00:49:32,942
It'll only take a minute.
You don't mind, do you?

581
00:49:33,152 --> 00:49:35,276
I always follow
the doctor's orders.

582
00:49:35,486 --> 00:49:37,820
Anything you
prescribe, I'll take.

583
00:49:38,571 --> 00:49:39,946
That's what I like
about you, Donna.

584
00:49:40,155 --> 00:49:41,446
Always so obliging.

585
00:49:45,825 --> 00:49:48,075
Hey Donna, where are you
going, what's the hurry?

586
00:49:48,284 --> 00:49:49,326
Hey Jeannie,
we're going to look

587
00:49:49,535 --> 00:49:50,660
for some bodies.

588
00:49:50,869 --> 00:49:51,451
You mean the contest?

589
00:49:51,662 --> 00:49:52,202
Yeah.

590
00:49:52,412 --> 00:49:52,952
Got any room for me?

591
00:49:53,162 --> 00:49:53,869
Oh sure, plenty.

592
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,162
Bill, this is Jeannie Reynolds.

593
00:49:55,372 --> 00:49:56,579
Jeannie, this is
Dr. Bill Cortner.

594
00:49:56,789 --> 00:49:57,872
- Hi.
- Hello.

595
00:49:58,082 --> 00:49:59,707
Hop in, but first we
gotta stop off at his place.

596
00:49:59,916 --> 00:50:00,748
Sure.

597
00:50:10,671 --> 00:50:12,501
Well as a matter of
a fact, that can wait.

598
00:50:13,334 --> 00:50:15,374
Now that there's two of
you, it will have to wait.

599
00:50:15,582 --> 00:50:17,705
Guess he thinks
there's safety in numbers.

600
00:50:17,913 --> 00:50:19,161
Oh, this time there is.

601
00:50:19,371 --> 00:50:21,159
We promise not to hurt you.

602
00:50:21,368 --> 00:50:22,824
And I promise
not to hurt you.

603
00:50:35,354 --> 00:50:36,061
Oh Bill, there's a seat.

604
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:37,393
Oh, there looks fine.

605
00:50:44,303 --> 00:50:45,385
Oh, thank you.

606
00:50:46,218 --> 00:50:47,342
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

607
00:50:47,549 --> 00:50:49,048
Well, it looks like
we're about ready to go.

608
00:50:49,256 --> 00:50:50,629
Backstage are five of the
girls who have reached

609
00:50:50,838 --> 00:50:53,585
the contest finals, and
we are here to choose

610
00:50:53,794 --> 00:50:55,582
Miss Body Beautiful.

611
00:50:55,792 --> 00:50:57,872
Now we've eliminated
everyone except the five

612
00:50:58,081 --> 00:51:01,078
finalists and they will be
judged solely by your applause.

613
00:51:01,286 --> 00:51:02,409
So let's bring them on.

614
00:51:02,619 --> 00:51:03,407
First...

615
00:51:04,533 --> 00:51:05,864
Helen Appleton.

616
00:51:26,843 --> 00:51:28,632
Betty Brockton!

617
00:51:42,703 --> 00:51:44,491
Terri Lund!

618
00:51:55,856 --> 00:51:57,645
Peggy Howard!

619
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:15,460
She has the second
nicest body I've ever seen.

620
00:52:15,669 --> 00:52:16,709
What, second to you?

621
00:52:16,917 --> 00:52:19,205
No, another girl,
a figure model.

622
00:52:19,415 --> 00:52:21,704
You remember that one
in school, years ago.

623
00:52:21,912 --> 00:52:23,327
The one who had the accident.

624
00:52:23,786 --> 00:52:26,532
Oh yeah, yeah,
Doris, uh...

625
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:27,447
Doris Powell.

626
00:52:27,657 --> 00:52:28,488
Yeah, is she still around?

627
00:52:28,698 --> 00:52:30,653
Few people see her nowadays.

628
00:52:30,862 --> 00:52:33,441
She just stays in her studio
posing for art classes

629
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,106
and camera bugs.

630
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:40,310
A figure model.

631
00:52:41,351 --> 00:52:42,848
Poses for art classes.

632
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:46,303
The nicest body she's ever seen.

633
00:52:47,345 --> 00:52:48,718
The nicest body.

634
00:52:49,884 --> 00:52:50,799
Maybe this is the one.

635
00:52:51,007 --> 00:52:52,338
She's got to be!

636
00:52:53,464 --> 00:52:55,752
I can keep Jan alive only
for a few more hours.

637
00:52:56,461 --> 00:52:58,375
I've got to find her a body.

638
00:53:12,653 --> 00:53:15,482
He... he intends
to kill somebody.

639
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:19,229
To rob them of their body.

640
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,933
Do you hear me?

641
00:53:27,429 --> 00:53:29,469
Yes, you hear me.

642
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:33,297
You know how Bill's
egotism drives him

643
00:53:33,506 --> 00:53:34,837
on and on.

644
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:38,083
To infamy upon infamy.

645
00:53:41,624 --> 00:53:44,286
How can good ever
be born of evil?

646
00:53:49,907 --> 00:53:53,360
Yet he claims his
work is for science.

647
00:53:54,236 --> 00:53:55,441
For humanity.

648
00:54:01,852 --> 00:54:05,224
To be joined to
flesh not your own.

649
00:54:08,053 --> 00:54:09,803
What's human in this?

650
00:54:11,427 --> 00:54:13,590
Of how you must exist?

651
00:54:13,798 --> 00:54:15,380
Locked behind that door.

652
00:54:17,336 --> 00:54:19,418
We've got to stop him!

653
00:56:05,934 --> 00:56:07,602
Okay, boys,
I've had it for today.

654
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:08,478
Come on baby, one more.

655
00:56:08,686 --> 00:56:09,394
Just one more, please!

656
00:56:09,605 --> 00:56:10,437
Another five minutes, baby!

657
00:56:10,646 --> 00:56:12,146
Time's just about up anyway.

658
00:56:12,356 --> 00:56:13,356
Okay.

659
00:56:30,867 --> 00:56:31,950
Say, Doris?

660
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,368
Would you like to
have a drink with me?

661
00:56:33,577 --> 00:56:35,660
Just you and me,
away from everybody,

662
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:36,912
some place where
nobody will butt in,

663
00:56:37,121 --> 00:56:39,080
where you and I can
really be alone.

664
00:56:39,289 --> 00:56:40,789
No, thank you.

665
00:56:40,998 --> 00:56:43,333
How about posing
for me, private-like?

666
00:56:43,542 --> 00:56:45,918
I'll pay you real money,
real good money.

667
00:56:46,127 --> 00:56:47,085
The kind of money they
don't throw at you

668
00:56:47,293 --> 00:56:49,754
everyday and for doing
hardly nothing at all.

669
00:56:49,962 --> 00:56:52,088
I do my posing
for classes only,

670
00:56:52,298 --> 00:56:55,172
Wednesdays and
Saturdays 8:00 to 10:00.

671
00:56:55,384 --> 00:56:56,048
Yeah, I know,
but we can—

672
00:56:56,258 --> 00:56:57,591
Goodnight.

673
00:57:17,146 --> 00:57:19,605
See it all, mister?

674
00:57:19,815 --> 00:57:21,439
The show's over.

675
00:57:21,649 --> 00:57:24,525
Next time bring a
camera and buy a ticket.

676
00:57:24,734 --> 00:57:26,860
I'm not running a charity!

677
00:57:27,487 --> 00:57:29,195
You don't remember me,
do you, Doris?

678
00:57:30,279 --> 00:57:35,031
Every guy on the make
gives me that same tired line.

679
00:57:35,241 --> 00:57:36,408
I'm Bill Cortner.

680
00:57:39,828 --> 00:57:41,701
Bill Cortner.

681
00:57:42,871 --> 00:57:45,163
Long time ago, that fight.

682
00:57:46,123 --> 00:57:47,873
You almost tore
that wise guy apart

683
00:57:48,082 --> 00:57:49,374
for making fun of me.

684
00:57:50,543 --> 00:57:52,167
After my accident.

685
00:57:52,918 --> 00:57:54,919
Look, uh, can't we
go somewhere and talk?

686
00:57:55,129 --> 00:57:56,586
No, I don't date men.

687
00:57:57,214 --> 00:57:59,213
Because I pose like I do,

688
00:57:59,423 --> 00:58:01,881
your mind works overtime.

689
00:58:02,092 --> 00:58:04,049
You get ideas.

690
00:58:04,259 --> 00:58:06,427
You're all alike.

691
00:58:07,177 --> 00:58:08,719
No, not all of us.

692
00:58:08,928 --> 00:58:10,387
I'm not on the make for you.

693
00:58:11,055 --> 00:58:13,930
Okay, so maybe
you're better than most.

694
00:58:14,141 --> 00:58:15,849
Maybe not.

695
00:58:16,058 --> 00:58:18,267
I still hate all men.

696
00:58:19,476 --> 00:58:21,978
I hate them for what
one did to me once.

697
00:58:22,645 --> 00:58:23,895
Have you forgotten?

698
00:58:24,813 --> 00:58:26,563
Well, have you?

699
00:58:28,065 --> 00:58:29,441
No, I haven't forgotten.

700
00:58:29,649 --> 00:58:32,526
Well, neither have I.

701
00:58:33,111 --> 00:58:36,154
I carry the memory
around with me.

702
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:39,822
Yeah, but you can't hide
yourself away here forever.

703
00:58:40,031 --> 00:58:42,198
Posting bare in front
of a bunch of neurotics.

704
00:58:42,408 --> 00:58:44,741
Listen, Galahad.

705
00:58:44,951 --> 00:58:48,077
I trusted a man once,
all the way!

706
00:58:48,286 --> 00:58:49,578
What did it get me?

707
00:58:49,787 --> 00:58:52,371
He gets his head full of
jealous lies and I get—

708
00:58:52,582 --> 00:58:53,080
You've got to
forget what happened!

709
00:58:53,289 --> 00:58:54,290
How can I forget?!

710
00:58:54,498 --> 00:58:57,041
I carry the memory
around with me.

711
00:58:57,501 --> 00:58:59,375
Permanently!

712
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:06,381
Am I so appealing to you now?

713
00:59:07,674 --> 00:59:09,299
Still so interested?

714
00:59:12,969 --> 00:59:15,094
Doesn't it make you sick?

715
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,431
You don't even
turn away from me,

716
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,058
like everyone else does.

717
00:59:26,185 --> 00:59:27,809
To me you're not ugly.

718
00:59:28,312 --> 00:59:29,770
I see only beauty in you.

719
00:59:30,896 --> 00:59:32,188
You have a lovely
body and a face

720
00:59:32,397 --> 00:59:34,230
that can be made
beautiful again also.

721
00:59:35,024 --> 00:59:35,939
Yeah.

722
00:59:37,066 --> 00:59:40,193
I've heard that song before.

723
00:59:40,402 --> 00:59:41,903
I'm a doctor, I know.

724
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:43,861
My father is one of the
leading plastic surgeons,

725
00:59:44,072 --> 00:59:45,946
if anyone can help you,
we can, I know I can.

726
00:59:46,822 --> 00:59:49,866
I've been to doctors;
it's no use.

727
00:59:50,074 --> 00:59:51,867
The scar tissue's too deep.

728
00:59:52,077 --> 00:59:52,910
No one can help me!

729
00:59:53,118 --> 00:59:55,411
Ah, ah, that was
a few years ago.

730
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,746
Today nothing is hopeless.

731
00:59:57,954 --> 01:00:01,039
Yeah, we can graft scar
and skin tissue that...

732
01:00:01,248 --> 01:00:04,493
Why we can even freeze
areas of the skin,

733
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,861
and sand away
damaged skin tissues.

734
01:00:08,485 --> 01:00:11,062
The way you say that,
that look in your eyes.

735
01:00:12,185 --> 01:00:14,346
I almost wanna believe you.

736
01:00:15,096 --> 01:00:16,842
I almost wanna believe you!

737
01:00:18,007 --> 01:00:19,961
Well then start
believing, hmm?

738
01:00:36,554 --> 01:00:38,840
Even if your
father could help me,

739
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:41,002
I couldn't pay him the kind
of money it would take.

740
01:00:41,212 --> 01:00:42,624
Oh, don't talk about money,

741
01:00:42,834 --> 01:00:44,745
he does a lot of work
without any charge.

742
01:00:48,572 --> 01:00:50,900
Why should you
wanna do this for me?

743
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:53,811
What's in it for you?

744
01:00:55,059 --> 01:00:57,719
I'm gonna make your
face beautiful again,

745
01:00:57,930 --> 01:00:59,965
cut it off and give
your body away.

746
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,493
I'm sorry.

747
01:01:07,992 --> 01:01:09,197
Bill...

748
01:01:10,363 --> 01:01:13,938
I have been knocked
around so many times...

749
01:01:14,936 --> 01:01:16,350
I've lost count!

750
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:19,427
It's tough living with this.

751
01:01:20,136 --> 01:01:22,213
I don't mean to
sound ungrateful.

752
01:01:22,422 --> 01:01:23,793
Well, because you've
been battered around,

753
01:01:24,002 --> 01:01:25,207
don't go sour.

754
01:01:25,416 --> 01:01:27,120
You shouldn't lose
your trust in people.

755
01:01:27,329 --> 01:01:28,409
Not all of us.

756
01:01:30,324 --> 01:01:32,651
I believe you, I want to.

757
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:36,684
Do you really think
something can be done?

758
01:01:36,893 --> 01:01:38,140
Only my father knows.

759
01:01:38,806 --> 01:01:40,635
Look we have a country
place just out of town.

760
01:01:40,845 --> 01:01:42,300
He's visiting for the weekend.

761
01:01:42,507 --> 01:01:44,378
I could take you there
now for a consultation.

762
01:01:44,586 --> 01:01:45,874
You mean tonight?

763
01:01:46,084 --> 01:01:47,455
Well, if you'd rather
wait till he comes back,

764
01:01:47,663 --> 01:01:48,619
if he comes back.

765
01:01:48,829 --> 01:01:49,992
Oh no, no, I mean,
he wouldn't be annoyed,

766
01:01:50,201 --> 01:01:52,404
being bothered with
me so late at night?

767
01:01:52,612 --> 01:01:54,566
Well, you let me
do the worrying, huh?

768
01:01:55,232 --> 01:01:56,561
I'll do anything
that'll help me

769
01:01:56,771 --> 01:01:58,600
get rid of this face.

770
01:01:59,598 --> 01:02:00,929
Well, that's where I come in.

771
01:02:01,761 --> 01:02:03,298
Remember the last
time I helped you?

772
01:02:07,417 --> 01:02:08,454
Where are you going?

773
01:02:09,371 --> 01:02:10,535
Who are you calling?

774
01:02:10,743 --> 01:02:13,320
My girlfriend, I want
to tell her the news.

775
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:15,317
Before you know what
the verdict is gonna be?

776
01:02:18,977 --> 01:02:20,723
You're right, I
shouldn't talk until I know

777
01:02:20,932 --> 01:02:22,303
what's going to happen.

778
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:24,674
My girlfriend, she's
supposed to drop in later,

779
01:02:24,882 --> 01:02:26,545
I'll have to leave her
a note or something.

780
01:02:26,754 --> 01:02:28,042
Well, just tell her
you'll see her later.

781
01:02:28,251 --> 01:02:29,497
Otherwise she'll ask a
lot of nosy questions.

782
01:02:29,706 --> 01:02:31,244
We wanna be sure first.

783
01:02:31,452 --> 01:02:32,658
Just throw something on, huh?

784
01:02:32,866 --> 01:02:34,362
I'll be with you in a minute.

785
01:02:44,718 --> 01:02:46,380
Just tell her
you'll keep in touch.

786
01:02:48,171 --> 01:02:49,666
I'll leave it on the
table, she'll see it.

787
01:02:51,663 --> 01:02:55,404
Had to go out with
old friend Bill Cortner.

788
01:02:56,155 --> 01:02:59,688
I'll call you tomorrow, Doris.

789
01:03:01,435 --> 01:03:02,515
Here.

790
01:03:08,547 --> 01:03:10,042
I'll leave it on the lamp.

791
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:15,863
She'll see it, won't she?

792
01:03:16,073 --> 01:03:17,944
That's the first
place she'll look.

793
01:03:18,152 --> 01:03:19,856
I'll leave the
lights on for her.

794
01:03:24,556 --> 01:03:25,677
Hmm.

795
01:03:26,967 --> 01:03:29,504
I have waited
so long for this.

796
01:03:30,377 --> 01:03:31,416
So have I.

797
01:03:43,935 --> 01:03:45,265
Again!

798
01:03:45,474 --> 01:03:46,596
Hit it again!

799
01:03:50,754 --> 01:03:53,082
I've got to see
your hideousness.

800
01:03:53,749 --> 01:03:55,411
And you've got to see mine.

801
01:03:58,074 --> 01:04:00,318
I wonder which of
us is more awful.

802
01:04:04,103 --> 01:04:07,346
Nothing you can be is more
terrible than what I am.

803
01:04:09,218 --> 01:04:11,006
A head without a body.

804
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,703
A head that should
be in its grave.

805
01:04:19,698 --> 01:04:21,276
I hate him.

806
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:25,144
I hate him for what
he's done to me.

807
01:04:26,642 --> 01:04:28,720
Can your horror match mine?

808
01:04:31,757 --> 01:04:34,210
Quiet, someone's coming.

809
01:04:53,672 --> 01:04:56,166
I have come to
feed your friend.

810
01:04:57,457 --> 01:05:01,156
While you feed yourself
with hate, it prefers food.

811
01:05:02,156 --> 01:05:04,941
Your former sniveling
fear becomes you more.

812
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:06,521
Eh.

813
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:15,299
What makes you think I'm
afraid of what's in there?

814
01:05:16,508 --> 01:05:17,715
Or of you?

815
01:05:18,507 --> 01:05:20,630
A mere head in
search of a body.

816
01:05:22,215 --> 01:05:25,004
People fear what
they don't understand.

817
01:05:26,046 --> 01:05:27,420
And what they can't see.

818
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:30,211
Oh, what are
you talking about?

819
01:05:31,795 --> 01:05:33,876
You're nothing but
a freak of life!

820
01:05:34,586 --> 01:05:36,333
And a freak of death!

821
01:05:37,334 --> 01:05:39,875
Why should I be afraid of
a few knocks on a door?

822
01:05:40,709 --> 01:05:42,290
But last night you ran.

823
01:05:43,374 --> 01:05:46,289
You were afraid of what you
imagined lay behind that door.

824
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:47,914
I?

825
01:05:50,914 --> 01:05:52,162
Imagined?

826
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:55,661
It was I who helped graft
together the bits and pieces

827
01:05:55,871 --> 01:05:57,203
that were stolen
from the hospital.

828
01:05:58,078 --> 01:06:00,286
An amputated arm,
a leg, a torso.

829
01:06:00,494 --> 01:06:01,702
It was I who helped
piece 'em together

830
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:03,909
like a monstrous jigsaw puzzle!

831
01:06:04,576 --> 01:06:07,199
And that same medicine
that he's fed to me

832
01:06:07,409 --> 01:06:09,991
to activate my lymphoid tissues.

833
01:06:10,449 --> 01:06:11,989
Has he fed it to that?

834
01:06:12,615 --> 01:06:13,780
No.

835
01:06:14,532 --> 01:06:17,029
No, on that he used
an earlier formula.

836
01:06:17,238 --> 01:06:20,195
It wasn't as successful as
the serum he's using on you.

837
01:06:20,404 --> 01:06:23,569
But it was enough to allow
the transplants to take.

838
01:06:25,903 --> 01:06:27,818
If your experiment
is successful...

839
01:06:29,651 --> 01:06:32,525
oh, then it'll be my turn.

840
01:06:32,734 --> 01:06:34,941
And what else
has happened to it?

841
01:06:37,066 --> 01:06:38,981
What do you mean,
what else?

842
01:06:41,481 --> 01:06:42,647
Well, it's...

843
01:06:43,356 --> 01:06:45,312
It's mutated some, of course.

844
01:06:46,688 --> 01:06:49,270
It's changed considerably.

845
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:52,977
Why don't you open the door?

846
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:55,809
Then we'll both see
how it's changed.

847
01:06:56,018 --> 01:06:57,809
Listen, you.
I warned you.

848
01:06:58,017 --> 01:07:00,225
You better stop pestering me,
do you hear?

849
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:03,348
I'm getting fed up with you
and your insidious talk.

850
01:07:03,558 --> 01:07:06,138
He should've cut out your
tongue while he was at it!

851
01:07:06,349 --> 01:07:07,806
Afraid?

852
01:07:09,264 --> 01:07:10,805
Afraid of whom?

853
01:07:11,014 --> 01:07:11,887
Of you?

854
01:07:12,639 --> 01:07:13,719
No.

855
01:07:14,055 --> 01:07:15,637
Not anymore.

856
01:07:16,137 --> 01:07:17,303
But of it?

857
01:07:19,636 --> 01:07:21,176
Nor of it.

858
01:07:31,966 --> 01:07:33,922
He only keeps it
locked in there so that...

859
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:36,797
it will be safe,
that's all.

860
01:07:37,381 --> 01:07:38,338
Safe?

861
01:07:39,673 --> 01:07:40,753
From me?

862
01:07:45,502 --> 01:07:47,960
Oh, you beast.

863
01:07:50,418 --> 01:07:52,834
I hope he prolongs your
existence into a lifetime

864
01:07:53,084 --> 01:07:53,874
of agony.

865
01:07:54,084 --> 01:07:55,874
Then we'll see who's
laughing at whom!

866
01:07:56,083 --> 01:07:58,081
You miserable fool!

867
01:07:58,291 --> 01:07:59,040
Jan: Get him!

868
01:08:06,871 --> 01:08:07,662
Get him!

869
01:08:07,871 --> 01:08:10,245
Oh my arm, oh!

870
01:08:16,493 --> 01:08:17,408
Kill him!

871
01:10:57,110 --> 01:10:59,271
You and your
father live here?

872
01:10:59,482 --> 01:11:00,643
Only on weekends
when we wanna get away

873
01:11:00,853 --> 01:11:01,642
from the city.

874
01:11:02,767 --> 01:11:05,136
This place
certainly is lonely.

875
01:11:05,343 --> 01:11:07,173
Well, the further from
prying eyes the better.

876
01:11:08,089 --> 01:11:09,004
I mean it's nice
and quiet here,

877
01:11:09,212 --> 01:11:11,207
we can get away from
the noise and telephones.

878
01:11:11,417 --> 01:11:12,580
Oh, I guess it is.

879
01:11:13,288 --> 01:11:15,200
Well, sit down, sit down,
I'll fix us a drink, huh?

880
01:11:15,908 --> 01:11:17,320
My father should be back soon.

881
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:20,357
You mean he's not here now?

882
01:11:21,481 --> 01:11:22,935
Oh, come on now, Doris.

883
01:11:23,145 --> 01:11:25,638
Do I look like a maniac who
goes around killing girls?

884
01:11:25,847 --> 01:11:27,551
Now, you've got to
learn to trust people.

885
01:11:27,761 --> 01:11:29,257
Well, people like me, really.

886
01:11:29,465 --> 01:11:32,042
Oh, I'm sorry.
I trust you.

887
01:11:32,875 --> 01:11:34,621
I trust you with my life.

888
01:11:35,538 --> 01:11:37,033
Well, I can't ask
for anymore than that.

889
01:11:40,653 --> 01:11:41,899
I'll be right back.

890
01:14:30,037 --> 01:14:33,114
Oh, I was beginning to think
you'd forgotten about me.

891
01:14:33,324 --> 01:14:34,612
Forgotten you?

892
01:14:34,819 --> 01:14:36,608
Oh, Doris, you've become
very important to me.

893
01:14:36,817 --> 01:14:37,896
Very important.

894
01:14:38,272 --> 01:14:39,144
I put a little water in
it, so it wouldn't be

895
01:14:39,354 --> 01:14:40,351
too strong for you.

896
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:42,846
Fine, I'm not a
very heavy drinker.

897
01:14:43,056 --> 01:14:44,092
Neither am I.

898
01:14:45,092 --> 01:14:47,503
Well, um,
here's to your future.

899
01:14:47,713 --> 01:14:48,958
Whatever it may be.

900
01:14:50,665 --> 01:14:52,077
I'll drink to that.

901
01:15:39,905 --> 01:15:42,233
Oh, it's getting
awfully warm in here.

902
01:16:05,397 --> 01:16:07,144
I feel kind of funny.

903
01:16:23,548 --> 01:16:24,795
Bill?

904
01:16:25,795 --> 01:16:28,750
You put something in my drink!

905
01:16:30,126 --> 01:16:31,456
Didn't you?

906
01:17:06,716 --> 01:17:08,672
I told you I'd
bring you a body.

907
01:17:10,713 --> 01:17:12,210
A beautiful one.

908
01:17:13,877 --> 01:17:15,250
Soon it will be yours.

909
01:17:15,458 --> 01:17:17,289
Jan: Bill, you can't!

910
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:18,664
Yes, I can!

911
01:17:20,205 --> 01:17:22,534
I want you as a complete woman,
not part of one.

912
01:17:26,156 --> 01:17:28,155
Is it a crime to
wanna keep you alive?

913
01:17:30,653 --> 01:17:33,233
Is it a crime for science
to jump ahead by years?

914
01:17:35,856 --> 01:17:37,480
This kind of thing must be done.

915
01:17:40,144 --> 01:17:41,683
When it's over, you'll see.

916
01:17:43,557 --> 01:17:45,389
I've got to hurry now.

917
01:17:45,598 --> 01:17:47,595
The drug will wear off
soon and she'll be awake.

918
01:17:50,302 --> 01:17:51,925
When she does come to,

919
01:17:53,257 --> 01:17:56,004
it will be your head
consciously awakening for her.

920
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:33,595
You must be stopped!

921
01:18:35,385 --> 01:18:36,717
You must!

922
01:18:36,925 --> 01:18:38,132
And who's going to do it?

923
01:18:39,299 --> 01:18:40,755
Now it's got to be quiet here.

924
01:18:42,047 --> 01:18:43,669
You can't stop me.

925
01:18:44,585 --> 01:18:45,625
Very well.

926
01:21:53,288 --> 01:21:55,534
I told you to let me die.
