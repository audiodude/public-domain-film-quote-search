THE DEVIL'S BATTLE MOBILE

3
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:25,363
<i>All Heathville loved Paul
Carraters, his kind rural doctor.</i>

4
00:01:25,613 --> 00:01:27,723
<i>Nobody suspected that in his
home laboratory on the slope.</i>

5
00:01:27,747 --> 00:01:30,057
<i>The hill overlooking the magnificent
Martin Heath mansion ..</i>

6
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:33,269
<i>The doctor found time to conduct
some secret experiments -</i>

7
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:39,216
<i>Strange, terrifying experiments.</i>

8
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,020
Ah, my friend ..

9
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,310
Our theory of glandular stimulation ..

10
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,680
With the help of
electrical impulses was true!

11
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:03,280
A couple of days ago you were
small, like your kindred.

12
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,380
And now - just look at yourself!

13
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:54,000
Hello? Says Dr. Carruthers.

14
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,540
This is Heath.

15
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,940
Today, Henry Morton and I are
having a small party at my house.

16
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,600
We want you to come.

17
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,880
You are very kind.
I am very grateful to you.

18
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,220
But I'm very busy, working on the
formula for a new after shave lotion.

19
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,500
Oh, doc, this is my daughter's idea.

20
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,580
She is very disappointed
if you do not come.

21
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,320
Refuse do not accept.
Make him come.

22
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,400
You see, there's something like
a special occasion here ..

23
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,060
Ready to argue - Mary is going
to announce her engagement ..

24
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,520
With this young shot, Don Morton.

25
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,180
Tell her I'll come. Bye.

26
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,720
Well, everything is arranged, he will come.

27
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,451
He will be surprised to learn
that a special occasion.

28
00:07:34,476 --> 00:07:36,564
This is giving him this
check with a bonus.

29
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,100
Five thousand dollars ..

30
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,360
Good.

31
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,980
You did not forget.

32
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:19,830
You hate this strange eastern
flavor, even in a dream.

33
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,060
Just as I hated him before
I made you big and strong.

34
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:33,760
Now, if you find this fragrance in
the night, when you are awake ..

35
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,800
You will attack!

36
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:49,640
Yes, you will attack .. to kill!

37
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,820
The dock is delayed.
He must have been called to the patient.

38
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,740
I'll phone him ..

39
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,040
Roy, Tommy, do not forget ..

40
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,362
You do not have to say
anything to the doctor

41
00:09:10,387 --> 00:09:12,474
about this check until
your father gets it.

42
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,100
And you warned those two doves?

43
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,020
Probably better to warn.

44
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,240
"I want to warn both of you."
"Do not say a word about the check."

45
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,900
While you yourself do not spoil them.

46
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,960
His father will show it to you, Mary.

47
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,176
Why do not you arrange a grand
opening, like for a statue?

48
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,660
Then we could all be there.

49
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,696
You know, I think it
would be better to seal

50
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,440
the check in a bottle
and run it to him.

51
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,520
It must have come to
you from the bottle.

52
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,680
"Well, that does not come."
"What a nuisance!"

53
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,900
He was too carried away by this new
formula and completely forgot about us.

54
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,725
He would forget about
the formula if he found

55
00:09:46,749 --> 00:09:48,316
out about the check for
5 thousand dollars.

56
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,330
Why do not we go to him
and give him a check?

57
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,880
Oh no, I would not do that.

58
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,100
He does not like guests who
come when he experiments.

59
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,540
- Roy can take him a check.
- Of course, I could.

60
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,520
Should I make a speech
when I hand it over?

61
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,572
No, actually, the check
itself speaks for itself.

62
00:10:03,584 --> 00:10:04,860
Yes, and says a lot.

63
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,640
Sonny, tell us that we are very
sorry that he could not come.

64
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,960
Of course, we understand
how busy he is.

65
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,460
Good.

66
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,280
Just a minute, Roy, now I'm free.

67
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,280
All is ready.

68
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,380
So, what can I do for you?

69
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,540
We are all very sorry that
you could not come today.

70
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,320
Yes, but, you see, I'm busy.

71
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,680
"Something important, very important."
Oh sure.

72
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,400
Mr. Morton and my father prepared
a little surprise for you.

73
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,220
Surprise?

74
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:48,800
"He's right here."
"Well, let's see what it is."

75
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:52,560
Five thousand dollars ..

76
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,300
What is it for?

77
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,020
Just a small sign of friendship.

78
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,020
Oh, I understand.

79
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,400
Bonus.

80
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,620
Well, that's very kind of you
from your father and Mr. Morton.

81
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,160
"Tomorrow I will thank them in person."
"I'll tell them, Doctor."

82
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,900
And you are not interested
in my new formula?

83
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,340
Of course, interesting, but I
did not want to seem curious.

84
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,440
- What is it?
- A new after shave lotion.

85
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,540
Smell it.

86
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,600
"A pretty strong smell, is not it?"
No no..

87
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,220
The odor will erode
shortly after use.

88
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,120
Try a few drops.

89
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,580
Now rub it in the soft
tissues of your neck.

90
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,340
Softens, does not it?

91
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,240
Yes..
When will it be ready for sale?

92
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,490
Oh, he's still in the experimental stage.

93
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,140
I first want to test it
on several people ..

94
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,660
And see if it works.

95
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,340
If you want, send me a bottle,
I will gladly test it for you.

96
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,800
Thank you.

97
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,560
Good night, doctor.

98
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,800
Goodbye, Roy ..

99
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,640
<i>Nice check, is not it, doctor?</i>

100
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,500
<i>They are rich - at your expense.</i>

101
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:38,500
<i>You made them rich, doctor.
It was your formula!</i>

102
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,280
<i>Today they gave you five
thousand dollars ..</i>

103
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,740
<i>And wanted you to come to their
home and thanked them for it.</i>

104
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,580
<i>It was your money, what they gave you ..</i>

105
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,360
<i>As if throwing the
ball obedient dog.</i>

106
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:17,240
<i>You must be very grateful,
doctor, very grateful.</i>

107
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,920
<i>Thanks to you they are rich and happy.</i>

108
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,040
<i>And what did you get, doctor?</i>

109
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,620
You have to work hard this night!

110
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,320
It's time for you to go!

111
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,780
But Mary, now that our families are here -
It's time to announce the engagement!

112
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,960
Listen, Don, I've loved you for a
long time, ever since we were kids ..

113
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,900
But I'm afraid, more like a sister.

114
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,300
Well, I...
I did not think it was that way ..

115
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,340
Something happened to Roy!

116
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,900
Roy!

117
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,060
"I'll call Dr. Carruthers!"
Faster please!

118
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,740
I can not help you.

119
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,480
"Do you want to say that he's dead?"
Yes. I'll call the coroner.

120
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,720
"Do you think this is a murder?"
I do not know.

121
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,540
I've never seen this before.

122
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,080
His jugular vein is torn.

123
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,220
Call Johnny Leighton to me!

124
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,180
Well, what have I done now?
Who wants to fire me now?

125
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,680
Nobody, for now.
But the day has just begun.

126
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,780
It came from Heathville.
Mysterious murder.

127
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,160
The son of the old Martin Heath.

128
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,820
- Who is Martin Heath?
- Who is Martin Heath?

129
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,180
Tell me, did you ever go
on a date with a girl?

130
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,273
With a girl? Oh yeah,
with the girl .. It

131
00:16:18,298 --> 00:16:20,444
seems that one day I was
walking with a girl.

132
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,960
"Well, did you smell good from her?"
Yes.

133
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,600
Of course, it smelled good.
As with most girls.

134
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,560
This is because of the limited
series of cosmetics Martin Heath.

135
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,920
He does all this stuff that
women put on their faces,

136
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,296
when they do not want to wash
themselves with water and soap!

137
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,920
Ah, I understand, he's a big man, right?

138
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,100
Yes, and a great supplier
of advertisements.

139
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:40,180
Take the photographer and
drive to Heightsville!

140
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,160
The coroner is conducting an investigation.

141
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,500
Find who actually killed
the son of old man Heath!

142
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,160
OK, McGuinty, I'm on my way!

143
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,840
"Chief Wilkins?"
- Yeah.

144
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,028
I'm Johnny Leighton from
the Chicago Registrar.

145
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,880
Nice to meet you.

146
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,080
And this is my photographer,
Shooter McGuire.

147
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,660
"Hello, Chief."
- Hi.

148
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,460
Look, we're here about
Heath's murder,

149
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,880
but from the coroner's investigation
we did not get much information.

150
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,180
I thought - maybe you can help us?

151
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,980
Well, I'm always ready to
cooperate with newspapers,

152
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,040
provided that they will
cooperate with me.

153
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,600
This is the policy of my newspaper.

154
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,940
I'll tell you the truth - I myself
did not understand this too.

155
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:35,240
Here's something that might interest you -
it's a snapshot of the victim's wounds.

156
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,380
With this glass you
can see better.

157
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,230
Are there scratches on
the neck and shoulders?

158
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,940
Yes, but we can not
determine what they did.

159
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,360
For the nails are too deep, and
for the knife - too superficial.

160
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,740
More like claws.

161
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,760
The same thing was said by Dr.
Carruthers during the inquiry.

162
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,460
Wild animal?

163
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,220
Is there a circus lately?

164
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,440
No.

165
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,771
And there was no escape
of animals from the zoo?

166
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:05,500
No.

167
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,676
Or maybe this is one of those
African leopard people?

168
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,960
"They use steel claws."
"This is not Africa."

169
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,240
OK, chief, I was just trying to help.

170
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,060
Chief, you do not exactly hold any
clues found during the investigation?

171
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,430
Well, since you're going to
work with me on this case ..

172
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,730
There is a clue.
But very strange.

173
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,600
The pathologist said that such
wounds could have been inflicted ..

174
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,680
Claws of a large bird.

175
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,100
Birds?

176
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,320
But in the district there are no
birds large enough to attack a man.

177
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,680
How about an eagle?

178
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,220
"But we know that it was not a bird."
How do you know?

179
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,800
Because we found a few hairs on
the shoulders of Heath's cloak.

180
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,320
Ah, Sherche la fem!

181
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,440
"This is not human hair."
"And whose?"

182
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,980
Well, it may seem stupid,

183
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,340
but laboratory tests showed
that they belonged to a mouse.

184
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,980
But who and when heard about the
mouse, so big to kill a person?

185
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,780
Listen, in bats, wool
is like a mouse ..

186
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,620
The only bats that are found
here are no more than a sparrow.

187
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:13,260
From the wounds came a strange smell,
but he was so weak and elusive ..

188
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,290
That the police chemist
could not identify him.

189
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,310
There is already something to work on.

190
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,900
Well, the smell could be evidence,
but it's destroyed - it evaporated.

191
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,920
Listen, Chief, do you mind if I
make myself something up here?

192
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,920
Of course not, roll.
And if I can help...

193
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,280
You can.

194
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,210
It seems that Miss Heath was
nearest to the murder scene.

195
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,480
I'd like to talk to her.
Can you arrange this?

196
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,860
I think I can.

197
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,860
Dr. Carraters refused
to talk to us.

198
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,776
We tried this morning
during the investigation ..

199
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,060
Do not worry about Dr.
Carruthers.

200
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,520
He's one of the best people in Heathville.

201
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,456
He just thought you were
interested in the tragedy of Mary,

202
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,040
to print a sensational article.

203
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,880
I will arrange an interview.

204
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,128
Thank you, chief, I'll
be in touch with you.

205
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,140
Good.

206
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,200
4-8-J.

207
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,420
Miss Heath, do you know if
your brother had enemies?

208
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,880
No, everyone in the village loved Roy.

209
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,160
And what did he do in the factory?

210
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:18,320
He was the head of the research
bureau, developing new products.

211
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,000
And here is Dr. Carruthers.

212
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,900
Hello, Doctor. "Hello, Mary."

213
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,160
I walked from my lab a short
way through the garden.

214
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,320
You met Dr. Carruthers this
morning at the inquest.

215
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,280
Yes.

216
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,320
Mr. Leighton, I hope you will forgive
me if I seemed slightly rude.

217
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,340
But I love Mary,

218
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,840
and mindful of the test, through which
she already had to go through ..

219
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,640
I wanted to protect her from a too
long experience of this tragedy.

220
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,460
Of course, you were right.

221
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,256
Now we are working on this
matter together with the police.

222
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,060
Yes, I understand, Chief Wilkins told me.

223
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,540
If there is anything I can do to help,
just give me a call.

224
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,190
Thank you.
"You will not sit down?"

225
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,760
"Shall I serve dessert?"
No, Maxine, I myself.

226
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,280
You can go. "Ui, mademoiselle."

227
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,720
"The Sahara, Mr. McGuire?"
"Oh, no, ma'am, for nothing.

228
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,720
Actually, I do not even need tea.

229
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,440
If I may be absent,
I'll look around.

230
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,620
Perhaps I'll find a clue.

231
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,840
Mr. Leighton, how do you like the theory
of Dr. Carruthers about a wild animal?

232
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,420
Frankly, I do not think so.

233
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,860
I would not blame you for that.

234
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,320
I, as a scientist, consider
many things from those,

235
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,920
what a simple man could not overlook.

236
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,320
For example?

237
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,600
The ragged edge of the wound,

238
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,680
The speed with which the
killer disappeared,

239
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,040
scratches from the claws
of a hare or beast ..

240
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,260
When an animal attacks a person -
there must be a lot of noise.

241
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,240
You heard the testimony of Miss Hit -
there were no sounds of struggle.

242
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:58,020
No.. Only these terrible cries.

243
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,420
All this is very mysterious,
very mysterious ..

244
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,960
Doctor, when you last saw Roy -

245
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,500
did he look worried,
nervous or gloomy?

246
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:12,060
No, not at all, on the contrary -
he was in a great mood.

247
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,436
Well, it's time for me to go back to the
village and start writing an article.

248
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,460
With your permission..

249
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,740
If you find it necessary to talk
again - you can come at any time.

250
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,980
Tonight, if you do not mind.
I would like to stay here for a while.

251
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,980
- Yes, I do not mind.
- Thank you.

252
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,220
"Good-bye, Miss Heath."
Bye. "Goodbye, doctor."

253
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,630
"A little more chiffon, baby."
But I do not understand..

254
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,780
Oh, you know what I'm talking about -
a little more stockings.

255
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,680
- Like this? Like?
- Of course! And who would not like it?

256
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:47,280
And now - do not move.
It will take a little time ..

257
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,940
Got to shoot - shoot!

258
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,180
Now, Johnny, I'm just
trying to focus.

259
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,780
Done, and - not bad!

260
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:07,120
I'll be back in a minute, Frenchcoats,
and do not worry about these werewolves,

261
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,540
because when I'm around -
nobody will hurt you!

262
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,340
You helped Maxine
feel so calm ..

263
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,190
My big brave journalist!

264
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,200
In my understanding this is called -
sit back.

265
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,940
Sit here and wait for the animal
to help us write the article.

266
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,400
Just look at this moon!

267
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,250
And I had a date with a French jacket ..

268
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,160
Yes, enough to complain.
We are supposed to solve the murder!

269
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,140
You, the "big brave journalist".

270
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,480
For the first time I was invited somewhere.
And ask not to shave until I go there.

271
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,400
I would like to watch your reaction
when you experience lotion.

272
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,390
Now understand..

273
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,820
I want the lotion to be perfect before
you transfer it to you for sale.

274
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,480
Here ..

275
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,820
Slightly harsh .. But customers will
decide that they are paying for it!

276
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,720
Oh, how nice! Very soothing.

277
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,560
I do not think that you will
ever use something else.

278
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,120
Well, we do not sell goods that
we would not use ourselves.

279
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,580
It smells so good that it can
practically be used instead of cologne!

280
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,940
Oh, what's up, doc?
Do not like your own lotion?

281
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,360
I have a terrible dislike for perfume.

282
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,120
Oh, I'm sorry.

283
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,220
Nothing, Tommy.

284
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,060
"Good night, doc."
Goodbye, Tommy ..

285
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,420
Hey..

286
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,160
What is it? "Where?"

287
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,260
There, something is moving ..

288
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,440
Get out of there, whoever you are!

289
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,160
What are you doing here, Miss Heath?

290
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,400
I thought that you would not be harmed by
the company. Maybe we should sit down?

291
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,029
You know, after what
happened, you should not

292
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:56,100
be wandering around
the garden at night.

293
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,010
- Yes, and you, too ..
- Well, my job is this.

294
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,160
Me too. Roy was my brother.

295
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,840
Careful, in my opinion, it's Tommy!

296
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,020
- Hey, Tommy.
- Hello. - Hey, Tommy.

297
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,340
How are you, sis?

298
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,400
Mr. Layton wanted to sit in the
garden for a while, and I joined him.

299
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,286
Do not tell me that you
are waiting for this

300
00:26:20,298 --> 00:26:21,900
animal, about which Dr.
Carraters spoke.

301
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,890
"So you do not believe that either?"
Of course not. What an absurdity.

302
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,300
Someone or something killed your brother.

303
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,660
And, I believe, you are practicing theory,

304
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,580
on which the murderer always
returns to the crime scene?

305
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,790
Maybe.

306
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,880
This is not for me.

307
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,320
Listen to my advice, Mary -

308
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,800
leave these gentlemen to
guard, and go to bed yourself.

309
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,080
Personally, I'll do it.
Goodnight.

310
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,700
Good night, Tommy.

311
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,780
I do not think your brother
likes my presence here.

312
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,450
Do not pay attention to Tommy.
We are all terribly annoyed.

313
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,000
I know.

314
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,940
Help!

315
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,940
"Tommy!"
- Faster!

316
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,920
For help!

317
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,380
But I'm telling you, McGuinty -
it was a bat!

318
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,480
I saw how she killed Tommy Heath!

319
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,560
Listen, Johnny, I want you
and Shooter back home.

320
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,260
Or I'll fire you both!

321
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,240
I'm not going back,
and Shooter, too.

322
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,740
He will stay here to take a
picture of this diabolical bat.

323
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,500
Listen, great will be the headline -

324
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,360
"The devil bat attacks again."

325
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,730
Listen, do not tell me this nonsense.

326
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,240
Maybe for you to send a van
with bars on the windows ..

327
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,510
And with strong guys
with straitjackets?

328
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,700
Listen, Joe, did I ever lie to you?

329
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,560
Many times.

330
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,240
But this time I'm not lying!

331
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,000
If it becomes known that I invented
this story about the devil's bat

332
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,420
I can not get a job
even in a rural weekly!

333
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:27,120
Print the article, Joe.
God swear, it's all true!

334
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,420
Okay, I'll type it.
But I do not believe in it,

335
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,560
until the Shooter takes a picture
of this diabolical bat in flight!

336
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,580
Do not worry, he will make it.
Bye.

337
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,840
You, my friend, will take a picture
of a diabolical bat in flight.

338
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,020
Who am I? How?

339
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,913
Have you not noticed
that there is a

340
00:28:43,925 --> 00:28:45,730
workshop of a stuffed
animal in the village?

341
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,120
You're not suggesting I go there
and stuff a stuffed bird, right?

342
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,280
Shooter, how could you think
what I'm offering you ..

343
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,640
To persuade the village jelly.

344
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,200
To make you a pretty
big bat for a picture?

345
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,760
In addition, the bat -
it's not a bird, it's an animal!

346
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,300
And what did not you just say?

347
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,000
Where is this bird feller?

348
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,980
Ah, the manager of the cottage!

349
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,280
<i>A mysterious diabolical
bat killed Thomas Heath!</i>

350
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,880
<i>Flying death strikes
another blow at Hithville.</i>

351
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,800
<i>The villagers live in fear
of the diabolical bat.</i>

352
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,710
<i>Thomas Heath fell victim to the monster.</i>

353
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:27,480
<i>Who will be the next victim
of the diabolical bat?</i>

354
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,860
<i>The villagers tremble with
terror in front of the killer.</i>

355
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,760
<i>Aftershave. Experimental.</i>

356
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,850
<i>The devil bat attacks again.</i>

357
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:01,550
<i>A winged monster kills a
new victim in Hatville.</i>

358
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:22,360
That's the idea, Frenchies - you keep
the bat while I'm cooking the camera.

359
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,760
When I raise my hand, you
will push the bat well -

360
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,760
and she rushes, as if in flight.

361
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,020
And I'll have a great
shot for the boss, okay?

362
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,500
Ui. I'm smart, are not I?

363
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,840
No. But hold the bat
until I raise my hand.

364
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,780
Cher, are not you hurt?

365
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:13,540
What did it take you to
break my devil's bat?

366
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,920
I'll make you pay for it!

367
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,360
And I'll put you in jail until
you explain it! Come on!

368
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,160
"You can not do this to me!"
"But I do, do not I?"

369
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,340
We just did a little experiment,

370
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,860
trying to understand how the
devil bat is committing murders.

371
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,900
I'm sure that McGuire was not
going to do anything wrong.

372
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,720
He's just too fanatical
in his work.

373
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,240
Yes, but the whole city is on ears.

374
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,100
And everyone with horror thinks, whether
he will become the next victim.

375
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,120
I do not need unnecessary problems,
even with an artificial bat.

376
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,960
You'd better go back to the hotel.
I want to talk to the chief privately.

377
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,740
"Can I go, Chief?"
"Yes, but be careful from now on."

378
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,340
Have you ever met a similar smell?

379
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,140
Yes! It's the same substance that was
on all the victims of the devil's bat!

380
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,820
"Where did you get it?"
Found in the bathroom of Don Morton.

381
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,640
Find out where Morton got it?

382
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,780
No, I did not raise suspicion
with unnecessary questions,

383
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,440
until this piece is analyzed.

384
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,080
Do you think this has anything
to do with the murders?

385
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,760
It occurred to me, but I
could not figure out which.

386
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,540
I immediately call a police chemist.

387
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,820
I'm poking around, maybe I'll
find out where he's from Morton.

388
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,440
Perhaps, from the cosmetic factory Hit.

389
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,260
My people are working on a hypothesis,

390
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,100
that the crimes committed by an
angry employee of the factory.

391
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,080
Certainly, it is not
a coincidence that,

392
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,180
that all the victims were members
of the Morton and Heath families.

393
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,980
Yes .. It seems like a
conspiracy to destroy them all.

394
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,220
I would like the remaining
of them to leave the city ..

395
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,080
Until the crime is solved.

396
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,940
You're worried about Mary, are not you?

397
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,860
Yes, I insisted that she leave, but
she will not go without her father.

398
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,916
And he persistently wants to stay here and
help with the disclosure of the crime.

399
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,860
And worse, neither Heath nor Morton ..

400
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,040
Did not allow me to
send them bodyguards.

401
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,156
I guess we'll have to wait
until something happens.

402
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,780
"Good night, Chief."
"Good night, Johnny."

403
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,220
Boy, I have a picture that
will dump McGuinty dead.

404
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,100
Meet the devil bat!

405
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:29,500
And what about this wire? It
looks like a bat on a trapeze.

406
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,580
I have not worked on it yet.

407
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,980
When I'm done with it, this
bat will look like this,

408
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,520
There is nothing around
her except for nothing.

409
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,820
OK, Rembrandt, you won.

410
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,560
Says your radio
commentator Walter King.

411
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,080
Today we are reporting from a
small village of Hittsville,

412
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,756
Where are the victims of the
supposedly devilish bat ..

413
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,140
For the last six months
there were three people.

414
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,180
You noticed, I said
"supposedly diabolical bat".

415
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,880
This, ladies and gentlemen, because
your correspondent is very skeptical ..

416
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,060
Refers to the possibility of the
existence of this monstrous creation.

417
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:04,660
Today I have a guest in my studio -
Professor Percival Garland Raines,

418
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,280
Perhaps the world's best
specialist in the animal world.

419
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,400
I'll take Professor Raines's
interview on an infernal bat.

420
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:13,400
Our audience can draw
their own conclusions.

421
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:17,040
Professor Raines, first let me
ask you a direct question -

422
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,960
Do you believe in the existence of
a creature like a diabolical bat?

423
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,340
I do not believe.

424
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,340
"He's an insolent fellow!" This!

425
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,440
In the forgotten centuries, when
men and women lived in caves ..

426
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,960
There could be
bats of this size.

427
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,200
But not in our days, not in this century.

428
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,040
How would you comment on
the fact that Mary Heath,

429
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,380
two of whose brothers were
victims of the diabolical bat,

430
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,860
and reporter John Layton claim to
have seen this incredible creature?

431
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,289
Sometimes, under the
influence of experiences,

432
00:34:44,301 --> 00:34:45,940
our brain can play
a joke with us.

433
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:49,400
Hey, does he mean you
saw a little bat?

434
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,760
Shut up.

435
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,616
And what about the photograph
of the devil's bat,

436
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,440
published in the newspaper of Mr.
Leighton?

437
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,720
I studied this picture under
a strong magnifying glass.

438
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,820
I declare that this is a fake.

439
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,900
Whoever created this strange monster -
he forgot to cut the label from silk.

440
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,660
From the silk used
for the left wing.

441
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:11,780
The label says "Made in Japan".

442
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,480
Order an urgent call to Heathville.
I want to talk to Johnny Leighton!

443
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,300
He lives in a hotel in Hithville.

444
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,720
- One attempt - who could it be?
- Yes, MwkGinty.

445
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,140
Come on, get out.

446
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,900
So you slipped me
a fake shot, huh?

447
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,780
You're fired, both of you!

448
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:45,220
And I'll make sure that you can not get
into any newspaper while I'm alive!

449
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,260
"Made in Japan"..

450
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,240
And tell Strelka McGuire that he will
have to take pictures in the madhouse!

451
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:54,000
Come back here both and
get your calculation!

452
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:57,060
Oh no, we will not come and
we will not get anything.

453
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,540
Well, we're fired -
but still remain here.

454
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,120
I saw this bat!

455
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,220
We stay here to catch this
mouse, and when we catch it -

456
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,520
I'll bring her and shove
you in the throat! Bye!

457
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:15,100
"Well, we're fired."
Yeah, again.

458
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,760
Now he calls to apologize.
Scare him right!

459
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,256
There's no point begging us to
work for you again, McGeady.

460
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,180
You fired us - so be it!

461
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,440
Oh, Mary ..
I thought it was someone else.

462
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,440
Johnny, why did you turn
such a tragedy into a joke?

463
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,536
Mary, I was not going to
turn anything into a joke!

464
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,260
I was just trying to make an article!

465
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,720
I suppose "making an article for you
means" publishing a fake picture".

466
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,540
This is a deliberate deception!

467
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,060
Now the whole district laughs!

468
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:47,900
Great job, Johnny, but, strangely
enough, I did not appreciate it.

469
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,780
"But I can explain this picture!"
"And do not try, Johnny."

470
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,640
"Made in Japan"..

471
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,100
I'll take off your living hide
and slay her to the barn door!

472
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,860
This is a chemical analysis
of that shaving lotion.

473
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,040
I see you could not identify
one of the ingredients.

474
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,940
Yes, the chemist said that perhaps it is an
element with which he is not yet familiar.

475
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,600
We will not go anywhere
until we identify him.

476
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:29,640
In this city there is only one
person who could help us.

477
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,360
Dr. Carruthers.

478
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,580
Yes, Carrateres could help us.

479
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,920
I found out that it was he
who created the lotion.

480
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,960
If you suspect Carraters -
you're barking out the wrong tree, Johnny.

481
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,120
He is the last person in this
city who would harm someone.

482
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,200
That's why everyone loves him.

483
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:50,000
Maybe..
But here's what I've dug up.

484
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:55,100
Heath and Morton made states on the
formula of a non-soiling cream,

485
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,100
developed by Dr. Carraters.

486
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,700
So what?

487
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:03,020
All that the doctor got for this was
$ 10,000, and others made a fortune.

488
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,832
Well, everyone knows
that he chose money,

489
00:38:05,857 --> 00:38:08,304
although he could become
a partner of the firm.

490
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:12,760
However, on each victim there was
this substance from his laboratory.

491
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,140
Johnny, maybe you're working
too hard on this thing?

492
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,720
Well, I just want to see
his reaction to this.

493
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,740
If he denies that he knows something.
Then it is somehow connected.

494
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,560
I think you're crazy.

495
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,480
Just to show you that I'm
checking all the options -

496
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,190
We'll talk to him.

497
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,480
Pour it into another bottle and do not say
that we would know that he created it.

498
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,960
And ask him to analyze it.

499
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,580
Doctor, I hope we did not interfere with
your work here so bursting into you?

500
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,240
Oh no, not at all!

501
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,680
I can not wait to help
solve these crimes.

502
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,640
All the victims were
my close friends.

503
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,309
Here is a sample of the
substance that was on

504
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:50,716
the younger Morton and
the two sons of Heath,

505
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,240
When they attacked
the devil's bat.

506
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,900
Of course, I do not understand why
a bird should attack only people,

507
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,120
using this particular substance.

508
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,560
The bat is not a
bird, it's a mammal.

509
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,520
Whatever the case, our police chemist could
not identify one of the ingredients.

510
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,700
We thought - suddenly you can.

511
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,660
And how! I created it myself.

512
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,960
This is a new shaving lotion,
with which I experimented.

513
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,100
An ingredient that your
chemist could not identify,

514
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,440
I discovered many years ago in Tibet.

515
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,400
And why did you decide to
use it in shaving lotion?

516
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,820
Lamas used it in one of their
religious rituals as an incense.

517
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,840
The smell is very pleasant and
competitors can not imitate it.

518
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,360
But why would Morton and the
two sons of Heath use it?

519
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,700
Oh, this is the policy of our firm -

520
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,580
experience any new product
before you put it on sale.

521
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:48,160
Well, that cut down our theory in the bud.

522
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,480
Yes..

523
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:53,590
We hoped that an unknown ingredient
might prove to be a clue.

524
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,680
This is not the bottle
I poured it into.

525
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,700
But I suppose your chemist poured
it when he did the analysis.

526
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,140
Yes.

527
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,040
Can I help you with anything else?

528
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:10,520
"Tell me, did you hear Professor
Raines on the radio last night?"

529
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,690
Yes, it was very interesting and exciting.

530
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,896
Do you mean you believe
that the devil bat exists?

531
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,300
Why not? You saw her, did not you?
"Of course I did!" And Mary saw!

532
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,220
Then why worry about what
one scientist is saying?

533
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,500
Because of this one scientist I was fired.

534
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:32,360
You mean your newspaper
threw you out?

535
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,440
- And there is.
- What a pity..

536
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:40,320
So you will leave when this
mystery is not yet revealed?

537
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,060
I'm afraid not. I'm going to stay
here and work with the boss.

538
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,700
If you're going to stay here...

539
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:55,880
I would like you to experience a
new lotion and say if you like it.

540
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,180
"And you, too, chief."
"No, no, it's not me, Doc.

541
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:04,180
If my wife smells on me perfume -
she will start to suspect me.

542
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,160
Well, Mr. Leighton, I understand
that you are not married ..

543
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,380
Well, I'll test it in the
morning when I shave.

544
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,400
"I think we should go, Chief?"
"See you later, doc."

545
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:17,580
"For now, Dr. Carruthers."
"Good-bye, Mr. Leighton."

546
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,880
What's the matter, what's the matter?

547
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,340
This smelly shaving lotion
plunged you into a dream?

548
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,320
Why did you tell Dook that you
use it if you think it's stinky?

549
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:39,360
I do not know, probably, I was ashamed for
the fact that I suspected the old dock.

550
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,120
Well, I like him, I'll tell him so.

551
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,340
What time is it now?

552
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,080
"It's past midnight."
"Midnight!"

553
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,140
There's no point in waiting here longer.

554
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,960
It must have been a
night out for the bats.

555
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,150
- You heard?
- Yes!

556
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,560
Prepare the camera!

557
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,780
Bend down!

558
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,200
You did it! Listen, Johnny ..

559
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,900
I'll make this bird for McGinnie,
and I'll feed him myself!

560
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:45,020
<i>The reporter killed the diabolical bat!</i>

561
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:50,080
<i>The monster is shot.</i>

562
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,420
<i>The end of the mouse power of terror.</i>

563
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:02,720
<i>The reporter killed a bat
looking for a victim.</i>

564
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:08,720
<i>Scientists are surprised
at a huge bat.</i>

565
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,820
<i>It is believed that this creature -
the last of its kind.</i>

566
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,660
I was still skeptical when I
arrived in Heathville today,

567
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,680
To investigate the body of the
so-called diabolical bat.

568
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:27,360
But after I saw her personally
and carefully studied ..

569
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:31,415
I came to the conclusion
that this creature.

570
00:43:31,427 --> 00:43:34,440
Relic of the species
of giant bats,

571
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:39,480
which in huge numbers existed
in the early Neolithic period.

572
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:43,950
<i>Maybe I should explain to
some of our listeners ..</i>

573
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:49,420
<i>That the Neolithic Age is a period
commonly called the Stone Age.</i>

574
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:57,040
Imbecil. Pompous ignoramus!

575
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:47,020
I'm sorry, McGuinty, but we and Shooter
are not interested .. in your pricing.

576
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,380
- Of course, if you add twenty ..
- Thirty!

577
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,800
Tree dollars plus a good
bonus - we could think.

578
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,580
You are extortionists!
I will not allow to be robbed!

579
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:02,120
As you wish, McGuinty, whatever you like,
but .. we have a mouse corpus delicti

580
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,880
and photos are a real bomb!

581
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,216
Of course, I have an
eyewitness account,

582
00:45:06,228 --> 00:45:08,520
which is already waiting
for two syndicates.

583
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,940
And do not forget - you have to pay
us for the time that we were fired!

584
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,560
That's better.

585
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,300
Well said, boss!
OK, we're working for you again.

586
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,576
We will finish something and in a
couple of days we will arrive.

587
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,940
Bye.

588
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,920
Sign in.

589
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,160
- Hello, Johnny ..
- Mary!

590
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:32,420
Johnny .. I came to say that I
regret what I said last time.

591
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,140
You think .. I do not know how to say it ..

592
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:37,320
Of course.

593
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,380
Miss Heath, do you think -

594
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:42,440
the Frenchwoman will
apologize to me if I visit her?

595
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,240
I'm sure!

596
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,940
Wonderful!

597
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:57,680
You will be even more than
your unhappy predecessor.

598
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,660
You're furious, are not you?

599
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,140
Excellent!

600
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:16,200
I'm also furious.

601
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,520
Today I'll call Henry Morton -
and you will destroy it!

602
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:29,220
Henry, the lotion was even
better than I had hoped.

603
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,360
I want you to experience it.

604
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,260
Leave it here, doc, I'll try
it tomorrow when I shave.

605
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,540
It smells good, does not it?

606
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,840
Yes, but is it not too strong?

607
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:50,400
No, no, evaporation will quickly bring
it to the desired level of smell.

608
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,680
Spread a few drops on your face ..

609
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,640
I'd rather wait to shave.

610
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:59,400
Then my skin will be more tender
and receptive to the lotion.

611
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,840
Well, a little bit, here ..

612
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:07,380
The skin here is always very gentle ..

613
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:12,560
I'll drop a little on your arm.

614
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,240
I hope you are right, and the
smell will quickly erode.

615
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,480
I smell all the way to heaven.

616
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:32,460
Perhaps this will be the
secret of his success.

617
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:35,420
In this business you never
know what can happen.

618
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,600
Can you believe me, Henry -
you do not have to worry.

619
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:45,360
Yes, I can believe that, doc.
All your formulas are very successful.

620
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:49,590
I looked through the company's
annual profit reports.

621
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:54,180
The income was a million dollars.
Not bad, eh?

622
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,680
Do you remember where we started?

623
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,960
With the unfortunate ten thousand
dollars for your formula.

624
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:05,190
You should not have taken
all the cash, Doc.

625
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:09,320
If you decided to join us,
you would also be rich.

626
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:14,840
Although, perhaps, you are more interesting
in your laboratory, with your experiments.

627
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,480
To invent something new ..

628
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,990
You're a dreamer, doc.

629
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:23,520
Dreamers are harmful to
have a lot of money.

630
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,980
Therefore, you try to pay me flattery,
telling me that I am a dreamer.

631
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:36,670
Well, I really dream ..
And you will never guess - about what.

632
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:42,540
I'm afraid you got nervous, doc.
Calm down, pull yourself together.

633
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,640
You worked too hard
on your formula.

634
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,180
Formula..

635
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,660
For a great scientist,
it's like a child's play.

636
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:58,100
Your brain is too weak to understand
what I achieved in the world of science!

637
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,960
Doc, you've made some great
scientific discovery.

638
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,460
What kind?

639
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,420
Henry, when you learn it -
it will be too late for you.

640
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,360
Come on, Doc, come on.

641
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,560
You can not pretend that you
control the fate of a person.

642
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:20,870
I have already proved this three times.

643
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:30,780
I apologize.

644
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,960
Perhaps you are right, Henry,
about the fact that I overworked.

645
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,680
I think I'm a little tired.
I'll go home and rest a bit.

646
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,680
Of course.
Sleep will do you good.

647
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:45,540
Good night, doc.

648
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,120
Goodbye, Henry.

649
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,080
36 J

650
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:04,260
<i>Hello?</i> "Is that you, Martin?"

651
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,980
<i>Yes, Henry.</i>

652
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:10,240
I want you to ask Chief of Police
Wilkins to come to you immediately.

653
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,760
- It is very important!
<i>- The boss now has me.</i>

654
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,840
Do not let him go until I come.

655
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,590
<i>And what happened?</i>

656
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,280
I think I found out who
committed all these murders.

657
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,000
Maybe I'm wrong..

658
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,380
But if my suspicions are
at least half true,

659
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:27,420
then this is the most diabolical
plan ever invented by man.

660
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:28,760
<i>What's the plan?</i>

661
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,660
Speaking of the scattered professors -
I forgot my hat.

662
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,910
<i>Henry, what are you talking about?</i>

663
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,720
I'll tell you everything
when I come to you.

664
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,300
I hope I did not interrupt
the personal conversation?

665
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:45,460
No, nothing important.

666
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,020
I hope Henry was right
about his suspicion.

667
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,740
But why did not he tell
me more on the phone?

668
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:22,980
When I began to insist on this -
he changed his tone, as if interrupted.

669
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,360
I'm afraid that someone could hear him.

670
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:34,180
"What is this scream?"
"Ah, just one of the nocturnal sounds."

671
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,640
Help!

672
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:03,060
<i>The partner of the devilish
bat kills Henry Morton.</i>

673
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:08,460
<i>The second flying monster kills
the resident of Heathville.</i>

674
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:18,390
<i>The village is horrified by
the appearance of a new bat.</i>

675
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:24,940
<i>Henry Morton - the fourth
victim of the devil's bat.</i>

676
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:31,560
<i>Horror resumes after
a new monster attack.</i>

677
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,640
Mr. Heath, it became much easier for
me when you asked me to live with you

678
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,960
don't kill this
new diabolical bat.

679
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,590
I'm worried about Mary.

680
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,780
What prompted you to think
that Mary was in danger?

681
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,380
Only the next ..

682
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,260
I'm convinced that someone
is using this bat,

683
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,580
To completely destroy the
families of Hits and Mortons.

684
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,396
As a scientist, I can assure you that
the thought of a man controlling a bat.

685
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,900
The idea that a person
controls a bat is fantastic.

686
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,220
Be that as it may, no villager
was killed or even attacked.

687
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,820
You forget that Mr.
McGuire was attacked,

688
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:09,860
and he does not belong
to any of this family.

689
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:12,160
Well, I'm already practically
a member of this family.

690
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,940
I'm going to marry
Miss Mary's maid.

691
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,680
Really?

692
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,076
Well, boys, I'll tell Maxine
to escort you to your rooms.

693
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,640
- Thank you.
- And I'll go home.

694
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,616
It's high time for me to sleep.
Good night, gentlemen.

695
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,080
"Good night, Martin."
"Good night, doc." "Good night, doctor."

696
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,840
Good-bye, Mary.

697
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,880
Come again.

698
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,020
"Maxine?" "Uwe, mademoiselle?"

699
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,180
You poured me something new
in the perfume bottle?

700
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,940
Oh no, mademoiselle, I
never touch your perfume.

701
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,440
Strange, I do not recognize him ..

702
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,760
Probably, my father
poured, as a surprise.

703
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,020
He always does this with all the new
spirits that he plans to release.

704
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,780
Anything else?
"No, Maxine, that's all."

705
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,020
Goodnight.
"Good night, mademoiselle."

706
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:54,140
Mary, what happened?

707
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,960
She tried to break through the window -
Big Bat!

708
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,280
Oh, how awful it was!

709
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,660
Mary, I want you to tell me
everything that I did ..

710
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,660
Before this bat tried
to get inside.

711
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:12,620
Well .. first I took a
bath and combed my hair ..

712
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:15,160
And Maxine came to check the mosquito net.

713
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,680
And the hook on the grid somehow
turned out to be uncoupled ..

714
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,860
Yes? Continue, what next?

715
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,640
Well, then we talked about new perfume ..

716
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,960
Someone poured it into the
bottles on my dressing table.

717
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,960
Dad, did you pour new
perfume into my vials?

718
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:30,610
No, I did not.

719
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,500
- This?
- Yes.

720
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:35,340
Johnny, smells like ..
"Hush, wait!"

721
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,400
I have a guess that
I want to test.

722
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,060
But only everyone should cooperate.

723
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,100
"We will do our best."
Of course!

724
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:44,740
"What phone do Carraters have?"
48 J.

725
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,040
Operator, connect with 48 J, please.

726
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,900
Hello, Dr. Carraters?
This is Johnny Leighton.

727
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:58,340
And there is.
With Mary something terrible happened.

728
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,720
You can come?

729
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:03,100
- I'm coming.
- Good.

730
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:05,320
Johnny, I'm fine, I do not need a doctor!

731
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:07,340
That's the point and it
came to cooperation, Mary.

732
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:09,336
You have to pretend that you
have a nervous breakdown.

733
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,040
Mr. Heath, you and Shooter have to help ..

734
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,960
Hold Dr. Carruthers
here as long as possible.

735
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,460
Where are you going, Johnny?

736
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,360
I'll go hunt for bats.

737
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,660
The devil bat tried to
penetrate this window.

738
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:07,280
She suffers from fright.
I'll give her a sedative.

739
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,300
"Where's Mr. Leighton?"

740
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,940
I guess he's in the garden,
hunting for the devil's bat.

741
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:16,000
Layton is a very brave young man.

742
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,860
Let's Miss Heath one
tablet every half hour.

743
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,780
"Uwe, doctor."
"It will calm her nerves."

744
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,320
But the doctor, maybe you'd
better stay until she calms down?

745
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:25,080
By morning she will recover.

746
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,220
Hey, doc, I do not feel much myself.

747
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,060
Do you mind measuring my temperature?

748
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,560
You look perfectly healthy, Mr.
McGuire.

749
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:35,400
You should look at my tongue, it
looks like a squirrel tail, look!

750
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,800
Try calomel.

751
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,180
Today we can have guests.

752
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:06,420
And for me it can be dangerous
if they find you here.

753
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:24,860
"Hi, Doc, I hope I'm not interrupting?"
No, not at all.

754
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,700
I heard that you went
after the devil's bat.

755
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:29,860
Successfully?

756
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,420
No, but I thought
you could help me.

757
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:36,740
I do not see how I would be mon,
but if you offer anything ..

758
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:41,220
You could give me a little of your
mixture, this after shave lotion.

759
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:45,420
But how does this help
catch the devil bat?

760
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:51,380
I still adhere to the insane idea
that this can attract a killer.

761
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:54,020
I do not see what kind of
connection there can be,

762
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,830
but there is a bottle
of lotion on the table.

763
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,320
Thank you.

764
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:20,210
You see, Doc, I figured something out ..

765
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:24,560
On all four of the dead was this lotion,
when the diabolical bat attacked.

766
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:30,880
My plan is to sit in the garden, and
when the assassin dives - I'll kill him.

767
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:35,000
Leighton, I'm afraid all these
murders have affected your mind.

768
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:39,660
Doc, maybe you want to come
with me and become a witness?

769
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:45,120
I'm sure I'll waste my time, but
I'll be glad to see your experiment.

770
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,940
Excellent. I knew that I
could count on your help.

771
01:03:54,180 --> 01:04:00,100
I tell you, Layton, to wait for the
bat to smell the lotion-stupidity.

772
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,440
I think I'd better go.

773
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:07,720
Sit down, doc .. Bat
today just lingers.

774
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:17,220
You are not very talkative today, doc.
What's the matter?

775
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:20,580
The weapon always makes me nervous.

776
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,980
Oh, I thought maybe you should
not sit too close to me ..

777
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,610
In case the
diabolical bat appears.

778
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,640
Based on your theory, the
assassin will not attack me.

779
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:33,640
I do not have this lotion.

780
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:39,780
Now there is, doc.
"Why did you do it?"

781
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,820
To make the probability 50 to 50, doc.

782
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:48,210
Now sit down and do not try
to throw out any trick.

783
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,280
Is not it fun when your own
jugular vein is in danger?

784
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:58,080
Is not that so, doc?

785
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:01,680
I .. do not understand
what you're talking about.

786
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:03,780
Perhaps you made a mistake,

787
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:06,740
when today released this your
diabolical bat from the attic.

788
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:11,980
Do not be afraid that the bat will kill
you. I will save you for the gallows.

789
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:19,500
Tell me, Doc, how did you
grow such a monstrous bat?

790
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,000
You would not understand
this scientific theory.

791
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:03,100
Oh, chief, what are you doing here?

792
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:06,640
Young man, do not think that
only you worked on this case.

793
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:08,280
And you were lucky that I was here.

794
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:09,596
Thank you.
Did you kill the devil bat?

795
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:10,780
No, she flew away.

796
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:12,888
Well, here's a bird that
did not fly away - and

797
01:06:12,913 --> 01:06:15,024
this is the killer that
we both were looking for.

798
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:17,780
Quick, shoot!

799
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:27,990
- Where's she?
- Disappeared.

800
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:30,660
And the doctor, too.

801
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:32,500
"Did you kill the bat?"
What happened?

802
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:36,000
Doc Carraters is a murderer, and
he hides somewhere in the garden.

803
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:38,300
You return to the
house and guard Mary.

804
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:41,120
Come on!

805
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:50,140
Doctor! Dr. Carruthers!

806
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:53,340
Doctor!

807
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:56,760
Is something wrong with Johnny?
Is he hurt?

808
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:00,360
He was taken to my house.
You'd better go with me.

809
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,640
It was Mary!

810
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:31,580
Are you all right, Mary?

811
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,980
Help Dr. Carruthers, he's over there!

812
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,580
Mary, this diabolical bat
belonged to the doctor.

813
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:41,380
He created it to commit
all these murders.

814
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:46,660
Well, it's too late to help.
