1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:00,042
25.000

2
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,622
Does it look familiar, son?

3
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:23,917
I remember that ridge over there.

4
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:28,005
Yeah. Cowhands ride over there in that big gap.

5
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,593
You know, it was right around here where
I picked you up, twelve years ago.

6
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,512
You was more dead than alive.

7
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,892
I'll never forget that night, Dusty.

8
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:44,062
Flash o' guns, shouts o' murdering men...

9
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,857
And the courage of my dad.

10
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:51,278
Shielding me and fighting a hopeless fight.

11
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:55,324
Riddled with bullets, he fell across me, whispering...

12
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:59,620
'Lay still, Ted boy. They'll think you're dead.'

13
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:04,291
He didn't know I had a slug through my lung.

14
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,213
Well, when they rode up, somebody lit a match.

15
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:11,715
And I laid still.

16
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:16,303
And I heard somebody say, 'They got 'em both.'

17
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,972
And the match died out.

18
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,226
And then somebody laughed.

19
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,104
I'll never forget that laugh, Dusty.
The laugh of a crazy man.

20
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,273
A killer.

21
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,904
Well, the next thing I knew, it was morning.

22
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:36,823
I was in your arms.

23
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,745
Yep, and I carried you all the way to Big Bend.

24
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,999
For two years, I didn't know whether you was
gonna live or die.

25
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,502
But you sure pulled through alright.

26
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,047
If we could just find some trace of my
kid brother...

27
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,424
Well, it's doubtful.

28
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,846
We did learn, however, that your dad
had a hired man and his wife.

29
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:03,100
I remember... a woman did the
cooking and took care of Jim.

30
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:08,313
you see, Dusty, my mother died when Jim was born.

31
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,525
And he's the only relative I have.

32
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,110
If he's alive.

33
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,612
That hired man and his wife disappeared.

34
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,949
We couldn't find hide nor hair of 'em.

35
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:24,037
Finally, there was a feller that moved on
the ranch by the name of...

36
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,248
Let's see... What was his name?

37
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,877
Gentry, that's it! Gentry.

38
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:31,461
But he didn't know nothing.

39
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:36,258
Anyway, it ain't gonna do you no good living
this all over again.

40
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,386
We'll be in town tomorrow and we'll start
our investigating.

41
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,479
Hey, Dusty.

42
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,831
Poison!

43
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,625
Water hole.

44
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,669
I didn't know.

45
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,665
I wonder who he is.

46
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,458
We better open it.

47
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,594
'Hello, Gentry.

48
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,473
This'll introduce Gat Ganns.

49
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,560
He's just the man for the job you mentioned.

50
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:14,273
Sorry I can't do it, but I got a couple of
star trackers on my tail.

51
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:18,777
Gat's plenty tough, as this enclosed poster will prove.

52
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,154
Good luck, Bill.'

53
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,074
Gentry.

54
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:26,910
Gentry!

55
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,745
He's evidently planning to kill him.

56
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,498
Well, that's the fella that's got your dad's ranch!

57
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,810
Certainly is funny, but you sure do resemble
this bozo.

58
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,775
Maybe fate's kinda taken a hand in this deal, Dusty.

59
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,152
Maybe so.

60
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,614
We don't know what this Gentry's up to, but...

61
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,157
We're gonna find out.

62
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:06,408
What do you mean?

63
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,705
I mean that from now on, I'm Gat Ganns.

64
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:13,373
Murderer.

65
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,715
Gentry, my daughter and I have considered
your offer for the ranch.

66
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,717
And have decided not to sell.

67
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,845
We've developed the best spring in the country.

68
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,640
And someday I hope to make this a fine ranch.

69
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,647
I'll admit it's dry wire, Mr. Winters,
and I don't blame you for holding onto it.

70
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,901
However, this country is still wild, and rustlers are pretty numerous.

71
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,737
That's why I have sold half the herd.

72
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,031
And we're going to sell the other half next week.

73
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,840
- Excuse me just a moment, Mr. Gentry.
- Go ahead.

74
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,599
- Everything check up alright, Mr. Hornsby?
- Everything's right.

75
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,268
They're on their way.

76
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,860
I think you'll find that's right, Ms. Winters.

77
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,659
That's quite right. Thank you so much,
Mr. Hornsby.

78
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,247
Too late for the bank now, Dad. I'll have
to deposit this first thing in the morning.

79
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,041
I've got some two-year-olds I'd like
to have you take a look at.

80
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:39,626
Alright!

81
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,217
- How do you do, Mr. Gentry?
- Fine. Very happy to see you, Ms. Winters.

82
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,888
Your father told me that you decided not to sell.

83
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:56,226
That's right. We're quite happy here, and
it's the kind of a ranch that Dad's always wanted.

84
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:57,769
So why shouldn't we keep it?

85
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,814
Well, if you're happy here, that's all that matters.

86
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,779
As your neighbor, may I be permitted
to call sometime?

87
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,991
Why, of course. Dad and I will be delighted
to have you.

88
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,993
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

89
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,694
- Good morning.
- Hello, chief.

90
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,696
- Hello.
- Hi, boys.

91
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,407
Well, Winters refuses to sell.

92
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,202
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, but I'm going to force him.

93
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,079
I'll ruin him.

94
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:00,541
The Winters girl's leaving the ranch
in the morning with a large sum of money.

95
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,711
Now, Joe and Hank, I want you to get it.

96
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,422
But remember, no harm must come to her.

97
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:10,467
I'll own that ranch no matter what it costs!

98
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:19,518
- There you are, honey.
- Alright, Dad. Now, I'll be right back.

99
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,229
Be careful!

100
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,311
If you hadn't have missed her, I'd have got her.

101
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:45,979
Well, it ain't too late yet.

102
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:14,276
- Can't get her now.
- Why didn't you keep her when you had her?

103
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,905
We never had her, you lassoed fool!

104
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,756
Drop that gun! Are you going crazy?

105
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:02,449
Cool down, now, before I go try it,
you pink-eyed weasel.

106
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:06,286
Come on, get in your saddle. We gotta go tell
the chief.

107
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:29,351
Them fellers is sure in a hurry.

108
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,836
Well, I reckon it's deserted.

109
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,381
We can camp here temporarily.

110
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,695
Dusty, come here.

111
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,537
Blood.

112
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:39,129
Hey, son. Get up here, quick!

113
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,436
Hey, son.

114
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,230
Bullet holes.

115
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:07,783
Fay Winters. It's mighty curious, Dusty.

116
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,285
We've gotta hurry and get her to town.

117
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:11,954
Let's take it easy now, son.

118
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,001
Got her here just in time.

119
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,504
A small artery's been severed.

120
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,506
However, I don't think it's very serious.

121
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,341
How did this happen?

122
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,594
Don't know. We found her just outside of town.

123
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,763
A horse must have thrown her.

124
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:32,933
We left our pack running loose.

125
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,310
I reckon we better get going.

126
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:39,189
- Yeah, we may be back later.
- Alright, boys.

127
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,441
I know the young lady'll be very grateful.

128
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,110
You've probably saved her life.

129
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:55,330
Now, listen, I hadn't better be seen around here,
so you take this money down and deposit it for her.

130
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,624
- And I'll meet you at the shack.
- Alright.

131
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,795
I'll tell you, boss, we couldn't catch her.

132
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,881
She just outrode us, that's all.

133
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,217
Well, I got another plan.

134
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:09,094
Get back to the hideout. I'll see you tonight.

135
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,270
Hello, Winters? This is Dr. Silsby.

136
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:22,232
Your daughter wanted me to tell you
she may be late getting home.

137
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,318
She's met with a slight accident.

138
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:29,114
No, not serious. I'll bring her out to the ranch a little later.

139
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:30,365
Thank you.

140
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:39,124
Who were the men that brought me in, Dr. Silsby?

141
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,210
They said they were prospectors.

142
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,170
It's lucky they found you.

143
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,380
A small artery has been severed.

144
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:47,883
And eventually, you may have bled to death.

145
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:52,179
As it is, the way you are, nobody'll ever
know that you have a scratch.

146
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,893
I certainly am grateful, but did they say anything about money?

147
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,269
Not a word.

148
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:02,898
I had three thousand dollars on me to deposit.

149
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:04,274
And it's gone.

150
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,109
Three thousand!

151
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:15,619
Your name Gentry?

152
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,287
Yeah, I'm Gentry.

153
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,790
We're from the border. Bill said to give you this.

154
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,586
He'd have come himself but he had a couple of
star packers on his trail.

155
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,478
So, you're Gat Ganns, eh?

156
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,146
That's what they call me.

157
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,483
- And this is my friend, Dusty.
- Hi.

158
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,569
- Howdy.
- We always work together.

159
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,280
Bill tell you what I wanted?

160
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:53,991
No, he just said there was gonna be some
gun-throwing.

161
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,327
How much do you want for the job?

162
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,413
What's the job?

163
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:02,749
There's a fella I wanna have disappear.

164
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,587
Well, whatever you're gonna give Bill'll be okay
with us.

165
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,672
- Eh, Dusty?
- Yeah.

166
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:11,842
Alright.

167
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,219
I'll take you over to meet the boys.

168
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,169
- Hello, Mr. Gentry!
- Hello, Spuds.

169
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,588
- Where's your dad?
- He's gettin' himself ready for dinner.

170
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:53,008
- Where are the boys?
- They're over at the corral.

171
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,762
Hey! Spuds! Spuds, get in here and get to work!

172
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,972
Hey, Spuds!

173
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:01,975
Oh, hello, boss.

174
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:08,857
Hey, Butch. I want you to meet Gat Ganns,
and his friend Dusty.

175
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:11,568
- Hiya, boys.
- Hi.

176
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,862
These boys have joined up with us for a while.

177
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:25,249
Come on, I want you to meet the rest of the boys.

178
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:34,716
Get in there! Get in there and get to work!

179
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,681
Hey, boys.

180
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,350
This is Gat Ganns, and his friend Dusty.

181
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,812
They're gonna be with us for a while.

182
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:49,106
I've got a little job to do tomorrow night.

183
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:51,400
You boys are taking all of Winters' cattle.

184
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:54,319
Taking 'em through the passe into Round Valley.

185
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:58,073
There's plenty of feed there. We'll dispose o' them later.

186
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,827
You boys can watch the house.

187
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,663
Winters'll be sure to come out when he hears
the racket.

188
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:08,917
Now, he's the man you want and you know
what to do.

189
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,211
Be sure it isn't the girl.

190
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:13,922
We're leaving about midnight.

191
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,801
Hank, show the boys to the sleeping quarters.

192
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:37,696
We're out of provisions, chief.

193
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:40,115
Yeah, well, here's fifty bucks.

194
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:44,578
And by the way, Butch. We're taking Winters' cattle
tomorrow night. You better get in on the drive.

195
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,455
- I'll be there, chief.
- Okay.

196
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:52,294
- I'm riding back with you, Gentry, to get my pack.
- Okay.

197
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:05,349
Hey, Spuds!

198
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:07,726
Come out here.

199
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:11,188
Tell the boys to hitch up the horses.
You're driving to town for provisions.

200
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:25,786
- Thanks.
- Is that Winters a tough hombre?

201
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:30,666
Just stubborn. I've tried to buy the ranch for
two years. Now I'm taking it.

202
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:32,960
Hasn't he any relatives?

203
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:34,127
A daughter.

204
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:35,754
I'm taking her along with the ranch.

205
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,799
Oh, I see! Like a dime novel.

206
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:43,470
We eliminate the old gent. You marry the gal and
get the ranch. Is that it?

207
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,847
You guessed it.

208
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:53,188
Go the way you always go. Don't ask any
questions and don't answer any.

209
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,899
And if you ain't back by dark, I'll tan you good.

210
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:57,901
- Get going!
- Giddyup!

211
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:24,469
Won't you come in, Dr. Silsby?

212
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:26,972
No, thank you. I got to be getting back.

213
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,892
- Well, thanks for the lift.
- Oh, that's alright.

214
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:35,189
Oh, Dad!

215
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:37,691
I lost the money!

216
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:41,069
Nevermind the money, dear. It's you I was worried
about.

217
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,698
We've got the rest of the herd to sell. That'll carry
you through til spring.

218
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:47,701
But tell me, Fay. What in the world happened?

219
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:50,746
Well, you see, there was two men that followed 
me out of town.

220
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,374
And that's the last thing I remember.

221
00:22:57,294 --> 00:22:59,922
I don't know. Doc said they were a couple of prospectors.

222
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:10,177
Well, fella, we sure had some ride, didn't we?

223
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:24,358
Come on, son. Let's go sit down and kinda pull
ourselves together.

224
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,037
I knowed you was gonna get me when
I passed you.

225
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:40,916
Oh, don't worry, Spuds. We're alright.

226
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,126
You're safe.

227
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:45,796
I know. But that's not what I'm thinkin' about.

228
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,132
I'm thinkin' o' what's gonna happen to me when I get back.

229
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:50,634
Butch'll beat me.

230
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:52,594
Oh, I'll have something to say about that.

231
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,640
You can't stop him. No one can. They have tried it.

232
00:25:56,974 --> 00:26:00,102
Well, I'll get your provisions and then go back
with you and explain things.

233
00:26:00,811 --> 00:26:03,146
Don't worry. Your dad isn't gonna whip you.

234
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:30,257
Now, I was beginning to think I'd have to come in
after you.

235
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,597
Where are the buckboards? What happened?

236
00:26:37,014 --> 00:26:40,684
The horses got scared. I managed to stop them,
but the buckboards got wrecked.

237
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:42,352
What about the provisions?

238
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:43,604
They're in my pack.

239
00:26:45,564 --> 00:26:46,690
Here's your change.

240
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:48,775
Get in the house.

241
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:55,282
I told 'em that kid couldn't hold them horses.

242
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,911
I've seen that fella someplace before, Dusty.

243
00:27:00,162 --> 00:27:02,247
But I can't think where.

244
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:08,921
I couldn't help it, I swear! I tell you, I couldn't!

245
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:16,428
- I'll tan you good --
- I couldn't help it! No, please! Stop!

246
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:18,514
- I'll take care of --
- Stop, please!

247
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:28,815
I've'd licked the rest of 'em.

248
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:31,443
Now I reckon it's just --

249
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:52,172
Come on, Ted!

250
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:34,214
You ever whip that kid again,
I'll break every bone in your carcass.

251
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:36,800
Oh. Alright, then. Let me go.

252
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:47,769
He won't whip you again, Spuds.

253
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:49,646
You're the only friend I've got.

254
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:51,231
Gee, you can fight!

255
00:28:51,732 --> 00:28:53,400
I'm gonna bet you busted his gizzards!

256
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:01,950
Gentry sent word that no one was to leave
the ranch.

257
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:04,161
And tonight's the night we're supposed
to get Winters.

258
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,996
How we gonna warn him?

259
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,041
Well, the only chance we got's when we get there.

260
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:13,420
Move over to the house from here.

261
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:16,840
But, remember. Don't mistake the girl for the man.

262
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,051
I'll get the boys started on the drive.

263
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:28,852
Gimme your knife, Dusty.

264
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:24,801
- What's wrong, Fay?
- Come here, Dad.

265
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:29,598
Look!

266
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:31,808
This just came through the window.

267
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:37,314
Why, it's our bank book!

268
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:39,608
The lost money has been deposited!

269
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:49,409
'Don't come... Don't strike a light.

270
00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:51,495
They're waiting to shoot you down.

271
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:53,789
Your life's worth more than your cattle.

272
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:55,874
Let them take them. A Friend.'

273
00:31:57,668 --> 00:31:59,002
They're stealing our cattle.

274
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:00,462
- I can't let --
- Dad!

275
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:01,922
Don't you understand?

276
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:04,925
They're waiting out there for you.
You wouldn't have a chance.

277
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:08,655
I saw the flash of a light.

278
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:11,158
I'm sure they got the note.

279
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:22,836
I don't think there's anybody home!

280
00:33:24,296 --> 00:33:29,301
Well, that's mighty strange.
Well, I've got the cattle anyway. Let's go.

281
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,848
They're gone.

282
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:36,600
And our cattle with them.

283
00:33:38,477 --> 00:33:43,482
Don't worry, Dad. Thanks to someone
we've got enough in the bank to carry us through.

284
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:50,572
Go over to Winters and ask him for a job.

285
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:54,535
He'll tell you about the cattle being stolen.
Tell him you'll help trail them.

286
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:56,828
I'm sure he'll take you up.

287
00:33:57,871 --> 00:34:01,416
When you get out of town, well...

288
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:02,960
Accidents happen.

289
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:06,213
That's a mighty smart idea, Gentry.

290
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:08,799
You sure know how to work things out.

291
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:11,969
Now, come on, Dusty. Let's get this over with.

292
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:47,296
Oh, how are you?

293
00:34:47,713 --> 00:34:48,964
I reckon you're the owner here.

294
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:52,176
- Yes, I am.
- Could you use a couple of good cowhands?

295
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,803
Well, I could've used you last night.

296
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:57,014
Rustlers run off all my cattle.

297
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:01,268
Well, they couldn't have gone far.

298
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:03,270
Cattle has to eat, you know.

299
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:05,022
Why don't you trail him?

300
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:08,442
I've phoned the sheriff, but he won't be back
til this afternoon.

301
00:35:09,526 --> 00:35:11,278
Well, we'll make you a little proposition.

302
00:35:12,029 --> 00:35:15,866
If we bring your herd back, will you give us
our jobs taking care of it?

303
00:35:16,617 --> 00:35:17,534
I sure will.

304
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:21,496
Well, that's fair enough. You better go with us
til we sight 'em.

305
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:23,790
Then you can come back and get the sheriff.

306
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:27,753
We may lose your rustlers, but we'll sure
get your cattle.

307
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:29,838
Alright, I'll saddle up right away.

308
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:35,969
Oh, Ms. Winters...

309
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:38,722
- Oh, good morning, Mr. Gentry.
- Good morning.

310
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:39,973
Is your dad around?

311
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:42,351
Why, yes. I think he's over at the barn.

312
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:44,645
- I'd like to see him.
- Alright.

313
00:35:54,363 --> 00:35:56,448
- Good morning, Gentry.
- Good morning, Mr. Winters.

314
00:35:56,949 --> 00:36:01,328
Rustlers run off my cattle last night, and I've
just hired these two boys to help trail him.

315
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,750
We'll take care of him, Ms. Winters.

316
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:10,504
When we sight the cattle, he's coming back
after the sheriff.

317
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:13,924
Oh! Oh, I see!

318
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:30,858
Don't worry, dear. I may be late getting back,
but I'll be here.

319
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:35,320
Good luck.

320
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:43,871
Oh, I do hope they find our cattle!

321
00:36:44,705 --> 00:36:49,793
In case your dad is late getting back, I'd be very happy
to keep you company this evening until his return.

322
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:54,089
Thank you, but I'm not afraid.
And I wouldn't like to inconvenience you.

323
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:57,009
Oh, that wouldn't be an inconvenience,
Ms. Winters.

324
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:59,636
In fact, it's going to be a real pleasure.

325
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,933
And here's the letter we got from Ganns.

326
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:12,232
'Hello, Gentry. This will introduce Gat Ganns.

327
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:14,651
He's just the man for the job you mentioned.

328
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:18,155
Sorry I can't do it, but I got a couple of
star packers on my trail.

329
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:22,451
Gat's plenty tough, as the enclosed poster
will prove.

330
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:23,577
Good luck. Bill.'

331
00:37:25,162 --> 00:37:26,413
Gentry!

332
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:28,832
That dirty smick!

333
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:31,752
I don't know how I can ever repay you boys.

334
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:35,088
I hate to think what would've happened if you
hadn't taken a hand in this.

335
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:37,049
Oh, gosh, Mr. Winters. We're glad to help you.

336
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:39,343
The question is what to do next.

337
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,262
I got it!

338
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:45,682
You go tell Gentry that we've disposed
of Mr. Winters here.

339
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:49,561
If he wants proof, take him and show him Ganns.

340
00:37:53,106 --> 00:37:54,358
And then...

341
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:58,320
Alright, get outta here before I shoot
the pants offa you.

342
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:42,049
- Well, Dusty's taken the shovel, but I guess
I can...
- Nevermind that.

343
00:39:42,591 --> 00:39:43,509
Where is your partner?

344
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:47,387
He beat it for the border. We figure that the
sooner we get outta here, the better.

345
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:49,264
And I suppose you want your dough.

346
00:39:49,765 --> 00:39:51,475
That's all I'm waiting for.

347
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:55,938
Well, the bank's closed, but I'll have it for you
at the hideout first thing in the morning.

348
00:39:56,355 --> 00:39:58,982
Fair enough. I'll stay at the Winters' place tonight.

349
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:01,151
Got a few things I wanna pick up.

350
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:03,445
Alright, but don't let the girl see you.

351
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:05,239
I won't let anyone see me.

352
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:06,907
Okay.

353
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:34,309
- Hello, boys.
- Hi, boss. Hi, chief.

354
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:36,270
Well, I got some good news for you.

355
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:40,566
The Winters' ranch'll soon be mine.

356
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:43,986
Ol' man Winters is dead.

357
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:48,699
- Well, that is good news, I'd say.
- I'll say it is, boys.

358
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:51,201
Wonder what happened to him.

359
00:40:57,249 --> 00:41:00,043
And now we're gonna collect five thousand dollars
reward.

360
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:01,712
- Five thousand?
- How?

361
00:41:02,129 --> 00:41:05,716
Gat Ganns is at the Winters' ranch,
but he'll be over here in the morning.

362
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:09,553
There's a price on his head of
five thousand dollars, dead or alive.

363
00:41:10,596 --> 00:41:14,558
- Dead men tell no tales.
- That's my job.

364
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:17,811
I don't care who does the job, just so it's done.

365
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:27,279
Peewee, you're gonna fly your tail outta here!

366
00:41:27,905 --> 00:41:30,741
They're laying plots and it's up to us to tell 'em!

367
00:42:24,086 --> 00:42:26,296
Why, Spuds! What're you doin' over here?

368
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:29,424
I come to tell you, they're gonna shoot you,
soon's you come to the hideout!

369
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:32,344
Gentry says there's a reward for you and he's
gonna get it.

370
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:34,513
Double-crossed, eh?

371
00:42:35,806 --> 00:42:40,269
Oh, you don't have to worry, Spuds. There's no
reward out for me, and they're not gonna get me.

372
00:42:41,645 --> 00:42:42,062
What's that?

373
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:43,814
That was Aunt Marthy's.

374
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,817
She gave it to me when she died.

375
00:42:47,776 --> 00:42:48,193
Marthy?

376
00:42:49,361 --> 00:42:54,032
Yeah, she was Butch's wife. She was the only
friend I had until you come.

377
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:55,492
Marthy, Butch...

378
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:59,538
Now I know where I've seen 'em. He and his
wife worked for my dad!

379
00:43:00,706 --> 00:43:04,459
Say, Spuds. Did Aunt Martha ever tell you
about your father?

380
00:43:05,169 --> 00:43:07,588
She said he was dead and that Butch wasn't
my real dad.

381
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:11,341
She left me a letter and told me not to open
it until I was grown up.

382
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:12,593
Well, where is it?

383
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:17,389
I brought this with me, 'cause Butch said he was
gonna shoot me and I ain't never going back there.

384
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,269
Here it is.

385
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:27,816
I'm gonna open this, Spuds. It may mean a lot
to both of us.

386
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:39,494
'Dear boy, your real name is Jim Hayden.

387
00:43:41,038 --> 00:43:45,125
Your dad and his brother were killed by Gentry
and his gang when you were a babe.

388
00:43:45,876 --> 00:43:48,670
Don't think hard of me, son. I've had no hand
in this.

389
00:43:49,213 --> 00:43:49,922
Aunt Martha.'

390
00:43:53,759 --> 00:43:56,595
Jim!

391
00:43:57,012 --> 00:43:58,388
Jim, do you know what that means?

392
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:01,183
It means you're my brother.

393
00:44:03,268 --> 00:44:04,311
My own little brother.

394
00:44:05,145 --> 00:44:07,022
Gee, ain't that swell!

395
00:44:13,278 --> 00:44:16,949
You know, boys, in a way this isn't any great
surprise to me.

396
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:20,577
I've suspicioned Gentry for a long time.

397
00:44:21,203 --> 00:44:23,080
But I've never been able to get anything on him.

398
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,917
Years ago, right after Hayden was killed...

399
00:44:28,085 --> 00:44:31,630
We suspected him of being the secret leader
of a band of rustlers.

400
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:33,841
But we were never able to prove it.

401
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:38,512
After reading that letter, there isn't a doubt
in my mind...

402
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:41,431
... but that he was guilty of Hayden's death.

403
00:44:43,183 --> 00:44:44,977
We've got enough on Gentry now!

404
00:44:45,394 --> 00:44:46,353
Why should we wait?

405
00:44:46,645 --> 00:44:48,730
Well, give Ted a chance to play his hand, Sheriff.

406
00:44:49,565 --> 00:44:51,441
He'll get word to us when he needs us.

407
00:44:56,864 --> 00:44:58,323
There's Gentry now.

408
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:20,220
No matter what happens, son, stay right here.

409
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:27,519
Mrs. Winters?

410
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:36,570
I hardly know how to tell you, but...
this poster will speak for itself.

411
00:45:43,911 --> 00:45:46,914
Why! That's the man that went with Dad!

412
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:50,042
- And he's a killer!
- That isn't the worst of it.

413
00:45:50,459 --> 00:45:53,378
Word just came to town that they found
your father --

414
00:45:53,795 --> 00:45:54,505
No!

415
00:45:55,255 --> 00:45:56,590
Don't say it!

416
00:45:57,424 --> 00:46:01,512
Don't cry, Fay. I want you to know that I'll take
care of you.

417
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:05,057
Why, I've loved you since the first time I saw you.

418
00:46:06,016 --> 00:46:09,436
- Please, Mr. Gentry --
- Don't you understand, Fay? I'm crazy about you!

419
00:46:09,853 --> 00:46:10,771
I'll give you everything you want!

420
00:46:11,313 --> 00:46:12,981
Please don't talk like that!

421
00:46:13,398 --> 00:46:16,193
Listen. I want you to be my wife.

422
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:17,861
Oh, take your hands off me!

423
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:19,863
Take your hands off, Gentry.

424
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:24,368
- You!
- What have you done with my father?

425
00:46:25,202 --> 00:46:26,745
Your father's safe, Ms. Winters.

426
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:30,624
Call the sheriff. I'm holding this man for murder.

427
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:32,584
Murder?

428
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:35,504
My name's Hayden. Ted Hayden.

429
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:39,550
Son of the man you and your gang murdered
twelve years ago.

430
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:42,302
You left me for dead, too, Gentry.

431
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:43,720
But I lived.

432
00:46:44,263 --> 00:46:45,931
Lived to even up the score.

433
00:46:46,765 --> 00:46:48,433
Why, he's crazy!

434
00:46:48,851 --> 00:46:50,102
That poster proves who he is.

435
00:46:50,644 --> 00:46:52,604
Then call the sheriff, Ms. Winters.

436
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:08,328
Hello?

437
00:47:08,662 --> 00:47:09,705
No, give me the sheriff's office.

438
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:18,672
You're mighty brave behind a gun, aren't you?

439
00:47:19,423 --> 00:47:22,926
Why, hangin' or shootin's too good for you,
Gentry.

440
00:47:35,022 --> 00:47:36,190
Hello, is this the sheriff's office?

441
00:47:37,232 --> 00:47:41,195
- This is Ms. Winters. Is my fath --?
- Yes, your father's here.

442
00:47:41,945 --> 00:47:42,946
He's alright.

443
00:47:44,948 --> 00:47:45,699
What's that?

444
00:47:47,868 --> 00:47:48,619
We'll be right over.

445
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,830
It's your daughter, Winters. We'll have to hurry.

446
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:20,437
- When Dusty comes, lead 'em right
to the hideout.
- Alright, Ted!

447
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:57,015
I'll be alright, dear. Don't you worry.

448
00:51:00,978 --> 00:51:03,146
Hey, Dusty! Ted said to follow me!

449
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,648
Come on, Winters!

450
00:52:20,641 --> 00:52:22,726
It's Ganns. He's got himself in a trap.

451
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:23,894
Gimme that gun.

452
00:52:33,153 --> 00:52:36,990
Listen, Gentry. Twelve years ago,
you killed my father.

453
00:52:37,533 --> 00:52:41,286
Separated me from my brother and took
everything outta my life that a kid could have.

454
00:52:41,912 --> 00:52:44,206
You know, I oughtta give you what
you gave my dad.

455
00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:47,334
But I'm keeping my hands clean, Gentry.

456
00:52:48,085 --> 00:52:49,503
I'm taking you to the law.

457
00:52:52,256 --> 00:52:54,424
Alright, boys. Let's riddle him with bullets.

458
00:53:03,934 --> 00:53:04,935
Why, it's Gentry!

459
00:53:21,952 --> 00:53:22,786
Up in the air, men!

460
00:53:24,037 --> 00:53:25,914
Where's the man called Ganns?

461
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:27,291
He's in there.

462
00:53:33,422 --> 00:53:38,218
Well, boys! I've been tryin' to meet up with you
for sometime!

463
00:53:44,474 --> 00:53:47,603
I reckon you got here just in time, brother.

464
00:53:56,486 --> 00:53:57,821
What're you thinking about, Jim?

465
00:53:58,864 --> 00:54:00,115
You know, Ted meant that.

466
00:54:00,657 --> 00:54:04,703
And he said when you married 'em,
it was gonna be twice as big.

467
00:54:05,412 --> 00:54:07,623
Oh! He has it all worked out, has he?

468
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,417
Sure, and you better accept his proposition.

469
00:54:11,084 --> 00:54:12,753
'Cause it'll be the only one you'll ever get.

470
00:54:13,587 --> 00:54:14,922
Well!

471
00:54:16,381 --> 00:54:18,342
What's my little brother been tellin' you?

472
00:54:20,844 --> 00:54:24,097
Well, I was tellin' her what you said you didn't
have the nerve to.

473
00:54:28,352 --> 00:54:29,603
Is my face red!

474
00:54:29,937 --> 00:54:34,191
Well, it oughtn't to be! 'Cause Fay said she'd
accept your proposition.

475
00:54:35,442 --> 00:54:36,818
Why, I --

476
00:54:37,236 --> 00:54:39,029
Gosh, now you're both burnin' up.

477
00:54:40,155 --> 00:54:42,449
I think your brother needs a good lecture.

478
00:54:42,783 --> 00:54:45,369
Lecture? He needs a good spanking!
