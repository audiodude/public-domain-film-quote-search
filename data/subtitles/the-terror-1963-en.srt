1
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,387
Hello!

2
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,224
Hello?

3
00:05:09,424 --> 00:05:12,227
Do you know the road to Colbin?

4
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:17,858
I was separated from my
regiment at Arshstadt.

5
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:22,446
Do you have any drinking water?

6
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,824
I'm very thirsty!

7
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,654
Clear water from the mountain.

8
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,423
Thank you, I-

9
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:41,858
Hello.

10
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,027
I'd like a word with you.

11
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,278
You never said goodbye to me.

12
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,739
In fact, you never
even said hello.

13
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:57,416
It isn't an act of
treason to talk to me.

14
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,793
I'm a weary,
disillusioned soldier.

15
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,920
And you're the
only pleasant sight

16
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,964
that I've seen in seven months.

17
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,007
Go ahead.

18
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:08,385
It's permitted for you to laugh.

19
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,637
Wait.

20
00:07:10,837 --> 00:07:11,837
You haven't told me your name.

21
00:07:12,037 --> 00:07:12,556
My name's Helene.

22
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,350
I want to show you something.

23
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,351
Wait!

24
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,312
Where are you going?

25
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,816
What's wrong?

26
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,245
Rest yourself, young man.

27
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,539
You're safe here.

28
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,333
Here, take this
for your strength.

29
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,131
God knows help is a very
rare thing in this forest.

30
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,632
Take it whenever
it's offered to you.

31
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,484
That bird.

32
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,570
He attacked me.

33
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,405
I'm afraid you're wrong.

34
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,615
She's quite harmless.

35
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,750
Here, hold out your arm.

36
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,671
She only seems dangerous.

37
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,840
Actually, she's
very affectionate,

38
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,260
which is very
unusual for a bird.

39
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,720
Take it back.

40
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,348
Oh, that is too bad.

41
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,850
Little girl liked
him, didn't you?

42
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:47,771
This is Gustav.

43
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,691
He brought you here.

44
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,985
Gustav fed your horse.

45
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,529
Where is Helene?

46
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,781
This is Helene.

47
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,866
No, not the bird, the girl.

48
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,076
Where is the girl?

49
00:11:01,276 --> 00:11:03,161
There is no girl.

50
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,621
Of course there's a girl.

51
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,830
I saw her.

52
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,030
She spoke to me.

53
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,045
Perhaps you were tired
from your long journey,

54
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,089
and had a pleasant illusion.

55
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:22,389
Gustav, have you ever
seen a girl here?

56
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,850
Gustav sometimes
imagines things.

57
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,645
If he could speak,
I think we would

58
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,107
find that his mind is warped.

59
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:37,654
Such is the will of God,
to endow and deprive.

60
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:45,787
The only thing of beauty you'll
find in this forest is Helene.

61
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:36,856
Hello.

62
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,070
I was afraid you'd drowned.

63
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,714
So you are real.

64
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,008
I started to think-

65
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,684
Who are you?

66
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,911
Wait, wait, danger.

67
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:30,887
Quick sand- the girl
was trying to kill me.

68
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,263
She knows not what she does.

69
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,599
Her will is not her own.

70
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,643
You mean she's insane?

71
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,437
Possessed, she needs your help.

72
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,272
Help?

73
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,024
How can I help her?

74
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:47,278
The castle of the Baron von
Leppe, you will find her there.

75
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,488
I can say no more.

76
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,906
There's great danger.

77
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,908
Find Eric, Eric knows.

78
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,679
The Ride to Colbin is
long and far safer by day.

79
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:16,975
If you leave now, you can
rejoin your regiment by dusk.

80
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,727
Where is Gustav?

81
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,854
What do you want him for?

82
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,357
I want him to show me where the
castle of the Baron von Leppe

83
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,900
is.

84
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,735
No one's lived in
the castle for years.

85
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:32,448
And, besides, Gustav has
gone away for a few days.

86
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,953
Perhaps you'd show me
the way to the castle.

87
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,205
Why are you so
interested in the Baron?

88
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,457
I never said that I was.

89
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,044
But the girl that I followed
last night and spoke to,

90
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,672
I believe that she lives there.

91
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:51,342
I told you, there is no girl.

92
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,511
That is nonsense.

93
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,096
You recognize her, don't you?

94
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,350
No.

95
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,154
I'll find the castle myself.

96
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,363
No!

97
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,290
Don't go to the castle.

98
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,000
I have told you the truth.

99
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,209
There is no girl.

100
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:26,409
Mark me, you are
getting yourself

101
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,212
into things beyond
your understanding.

102
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,798
Leave now, while you can.

103
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,301
I intend to find her.

104
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,012
Please don't tell the
Baron that I am here.

105
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,085
Hello!

106
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,795
Is anyone here?

107
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,177
Hello, it's me, Andre.

108
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,657
In the name of the
government of France,

109
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,701
I order you to open this door!

110
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,999
Your pardon, young sir,
I was at my devotions.

111
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,500
I did not hear you.

112
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,919
I'm sorry, sir.

113
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:17,256
But surely I made enough
noise to awaken the dead.

114
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,925
The government of France.

115
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:24,096
I've seen the uniforms of
many governments in my time.

116
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,974
What would a soldier of
France be wanting here?

117
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,643
Shelter, for one thing.

118
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:33,856
Permit me to introduce myself,
Lieutenant Andre Duvalier.

119
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,151
Baron Victor
Frederick von Lepp.

120
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,154
I suggest you will find better
shelter at the village inn.

121
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,364
Thank you, Baron.

122
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,658
But I've had my fill
of village inns.

123
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,410
Surely, you wouldn't want to
inconvenience a French officer.

124
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:49,705
Come in.

125
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:04,553
What you see, Lieutenant, are
the remains of a noble house-

126
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:10,351
relics, ghosts of past glories.

127
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,562
A noble heritage is something
to be proud of, Baron.

128
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,148
I'm afraid we've
forgotten that in France.

129
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:20,194
Ah yes, your name,
Duvalier, your family-

130
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,364
My father was the
Count Duvalier- was,

131
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,950
until they spilled his head
into a basket one morning

132
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,410
in the Place de la Concorde.

133
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,997
Forgive me for reviving
painful memories.

134
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:34,166
You must be cold and
tired, Lieutenant.

135
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,418
Some cognac?

136
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,378
I'd like that,
Baron, thank you.

137
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,921
Sit down.

138
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,303
Yes, Baron?

139
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,723
Cognac, for our guest.

140
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,142
Yes, Baron.

141
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,227
Baron, I wonder
if I might ask, who

142
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,021
was the young woman
I saw in the window

143
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,565
before you came to the door?

144
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,817
Young woman?

145
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,278
Oh, I'm afraid you're mistaken.

146
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,155
No, I'm not mistaken.

147
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:09,076
I saw her, dark hair
and eyes, about 20.

148
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:13,331
Well, I'm quite sure you
think you saw someone.

149
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,540
But-

150
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,585
Baron, I am in full
possession of my faculties.

151
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:21,213
Please, allow me to
show you something.

152
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,265
You should never
believe everything

153
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,393
your eyes tell you, young man.

154
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:38,147
Is that the girl
you think you saw?

155
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,357
Yes, of course-

156
00:22:39,557 --> 00:22:43,069
Before you say anything,
examine the portrait closely,

157
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:46,238
the signature- and
above all, the date.

158
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:55,039
1786?

159
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,916
But that's 20 years ago.

160
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,125
It's incredible.

161
00:22:58,325 --> 00:22:59,325
It's the same girl.

162
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:01,128
And she hasn't changed a bit.

163
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,422
She has been dead for 20 years.

164
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,345
With all respect,
Baron, for a ghost,

165
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:13,265
she's very active young woman.

166
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,644
You're speaking of the
Baroness von Lepp, my wife.

167
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,397
I beg your pardon,
Baron, I meant no offense.

168
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:22,691
Perhaps the resemblance was not
quite as much as I had thought.

169
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:23,901
The girl at the window-

170
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:28,155
Lieutenant Duvalier, the
only occupants of this castle

171
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,450
are Stefan and myself.

172
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,329
You are the first visitor
since the turn of the century.

173
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,539
Of course, Baron.

174
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,666
Stefan will see
you to your room.

175
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:39,875
Thank you.

176
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,987
Hello down there!

177
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,280
I'm coming down!

178
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,490
Wait for me!

179
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,463
Alright, unlock this door.

180
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,465
Do you hear me?

181
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:55,010
Unlock this door or I'm going
to shoot through the door!

182
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,125
Ah!

183
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:07,930
I kept in the shadows, sir.

184
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,139
He did not see me.

185
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,724
He's a strange one, though.

186
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,768
He showed no fear.

187
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:13,977
He must leave at once.

188
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,480
Do you think, perhaps, he
is not merely a traveler?

189
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:17,773
Why do you say that?

190
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,817
He might have heard
things in the village.

191
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,193
Oh, nonsense, he's a soldier.

192
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:23,695
He doesn't listen
to old wives' tales.

193
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:28,826
The important thing is that
he leave with all due speed.

194
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,494
I shall see to it, sir.

195
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:31,870
But of his own accord.

196
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,872
We must show him the
respect that his position

197
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,874
and rank demand.

198
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,793
How quickly.

199
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,002
I understand, sir.

200
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,700
So, must you intrude on the
dead as well as the living?

201
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,660
If I intrude, Stefan,
I shall leave it

202
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,328
to my host to so inform me.

203
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,872
Why have you come
to Castle von Leppe?

204
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,957
What do you want here?

205
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,084
You seem to have things
strangely confused

206
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,294
in your mind.

207
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:23,505
You're the servant, not
I. I'll ask the questions.

208
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,892
This was once a
place of worship.

209
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,269
Why have the holy
objects been removed?

210
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:42,316
The baron ordered it
when his wife passed away.

211
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:43,650
Then this became her tomb?

212
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,694
No, just the entrance to it.

213
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,280
The von Leppe family crypt lies
below, beneath the cemetery.

214
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,490
She rests there with four
centuries of von Leppes.

215
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:56,288
That's been sealed for 20 years.

216
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,040
Nonsense.

217
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,541
It must have been
open last night.

218
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,960
The girl must have
passed through here.

219
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,837
As the Baron told you,
sir, there is no girl.

220
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,589
No girl.

221
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,007
Well, we shall see.

222
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,342
Come with me to
the stable, Stefan.

223
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:09,885
I wish to attend to my horse.

224
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,720
Wait, Lieutenant.

225
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,430
That's what I came to tell you.

226
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,890
Your horse is gone.

227
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,683
Apparently, it bolted
during the night.

228
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,060
Impossible, you're lying.

229
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,269
Why?

230
00:32:19,469 --> 00:32:21,146
No, sir, I'm not lying.

231
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,856
Hear me well, Stefan.

232
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:26,818
I'm sick of all of these lies-
first the old woman, then

233
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,028
the baron, and now you.

234
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,154
The old woman, you mean-

235
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,280
Never mind.

236
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,907
What about my horse?

237
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,409
I shall get you another one
from the village at once, sir.

238
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,078
Believe me, lieutenant,
I have no desire

239
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,205
to interfere with your
departure from this castle.

240
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,916
You seem very anxious
to be rid of me.

241
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,086
Is it because you're afraid
I might find out about Eric?

242
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,883
Eric?

243
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,802
So there is an Eric?

244
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,012
That at least was not a lie.

245
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,765
Lieutenant, please,
don't involve yourself

246
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,600
in these dead matters.

247
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,937
There is nothing here but an old
man and his decaying memories.

248
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,981
I beg of you,
leave him in peace!

249
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,032
Will you join me, lieutenant?

250
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,742
No thank you, Baron.

251
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,452
I've just come from the stables.

252
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,704
My horse is gone.

253
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,039
Your horse is gone?

254
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,916
Yes, I believe it
was stolen, Baron.

255
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,711
Oh, impossible.

256
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,089
The stable door perhaps was left
open and the animal bolted-

257
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,008
not an unusual thing.

258
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:34,011
In itself, no, but there
are certain other mysteries

259
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,512
I would like to have
explained, Baron.

260
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,806
And I mean to have
them explained.

261
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,100
How dare you take
that tone with me.

262
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,393
I don't know to be abrupt.

263
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,602
But I will have answers.

264
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,108
Well-

265
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:52,070
Now, why did you the portrait
of the Baroness from the wall?

266
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,573
I sent it away for renovation.

267
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,616
The- the dampness
of these walls

268
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,201
puts a mold on the pigment.

269
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,162
You evade very cleverly, Baron.

270
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,998
Can you also explain the
violin music and the girl

271
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,583
in the chapel last night?

272
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:05,792
You saw her again?

273
00:34:05,992 --> 00:34:06,992
So you admit there's a girl?

274
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,086
Ilsa.

275
00:34:08,286 --> 00:34:09,286
Ilsa, is that her name?

276
00:34:09,486 --> 00:34:10,172
Answer me, Baron.

277
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,423
Please, please,
leave me in peace.

278
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:14,509
If I leave you now,
Baron, I will come back

279
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,719
with a company of my men.

280
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,888
And I will tear this place
down around your ears

281
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,097
until I find her.

282
00:34:19,297 --> 00:34:20,297
Is that clear?

283
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,435
Very clear.

284
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,353
All right, now what
happened to the Baroness?

285
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,855
Was her death violent?

286
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,607
Yes, her death was violent.

287
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,692
How did she die?

288
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,029
Can you spare me nothing?

289
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:37,866
20 years ago, I was not the
man you're looking at now.

290
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,368
This land, this
estate prospered.

291
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,996
My people live well
and were happy.

292
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,040
My wife had died
some years before.

293
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,666
And I was lonely.

294
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,044
Then one day in
the village, I saw

295
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,631
Ilsa, a peasant girl who'd come
to live there with her mother.

296
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,093
Oh, I could have
taken her as nobles

297
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,136
have taken the
daughters of peasants

298
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,097
since the beginning of time.

299
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:03,058
But I loved her.

300
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:07,479
And she became the
Baroness von Leppe.

301
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:10,023
Almost immediately
afterwards, I was called away

302
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,067
for military
service, a rebellion

303
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,653
in the Polish province.

304
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,196
I was gone for nearly a year.

305
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:21,201
When the fighting was over,
I hurried home to my bride.

306
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,123
No one knew of my coming.

307
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:27,666
I surprised her in her room.

308
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,835
She was not alone.

309
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:34,422
She laughed at me, said her bed
was not for me to find another.

310
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:39,136
And with my own
hands, I killed her.

311
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:42,013
And her lover?

312
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:46,560
Stefan took care of him.

313
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:50,856
Later, I gave out a story that
she had died of some malaise.

314
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:56,236
No one ever knew of her betrayal
of me, or how, in fact, she did

315
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,029
die.

316
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,574
Except for Stefan.

317
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:03,368
For 20 years, I've not
set foot beyond the walls

318
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,829
of this castle.

319
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:10,834
I've lived here alone with the
memory of that dreadful thing

320
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:14,254
I did that night.

321
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,923
That is my penance.

322
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,633
And now you believe what?

323
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,052
That the ghost of Ilsa has
come back to relieve you

324
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,054
of your penance, is that it?

325
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,306
Yes.

326
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:27,142
How long has the spirit
been coming to the castle?

327
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:31,271
It- it all began
two years ago.

328
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,647
At first, I was terrified.

329
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:37,569
But now I- I'm eager
for our every meeting.

330
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,821
One more question, Baron.

331
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,742
Has anyone else except yourself
seen this spirit, Stefan,

332
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:44,951
for instance?

333
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,667
You think I'm mad, don't you?

334
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:56,171
Right now, Baron, I'm not
sure just what I think.

335
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,506
Ah, but don't forget.

336
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,885
You saw her too.

337
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,345
Perhaps we are both mad.

338
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:36,294
Ilsa, Ilsa.

339
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,837
Ilsa?

340
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:41,758
The name sounds strange
to me here by the sea.

341
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,051
It your name.

342
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,845
Don't you remember?

343
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,014
My name is Helene.

344
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,516
The old woman told me.

345
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,685
She lies.

346
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:54,729
She summoned me from the sea.

347
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,481
You must go back.

348
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,858
Your soul is troubled, Ilsa.

349
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,068
Go back?

350
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,444
To Eric?

351
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:05,240
To the sea.

352
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,909
Only when the sea
enters the crypt.

353
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:15,333
We shall rest there together,
he and I, beneath the sea.

354
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,626
It is an evil thing.

355
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,212
You must not do it, Ilsa.

356
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,423
I must obey the old woman.

357
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:33,435
The Frenchman, he
can help you, Ilsa.

358
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:34,644
Andre?

359
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,618
The old one calls.

360
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:58,376
She warned you, Gustav,
do not interfere.

361
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:02,088
She's been patient with you
long enough, but no more.

362
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:04,442
Oh, powers of darkness,
let the spirit of Ilsa

363
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:09,364
sink deeper, deeper
into this mortal fog.

364
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:16,413
Helene, be as though
you never were.

365
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:21,084
Spirit of Ilsa, see
through these eyes.

366
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,794
Speak through these lips.

367
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,796
Do my bidding.

368
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:30,760
For only then, shall you find
release from your torment.

369
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:42,313
You are becoming stronger
now, quite strong.

370
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:46,276
Soon you shall have the
strength to carry out

371
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:50,280
my vengeance, vengeance.

372
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:53,241
And the dark powers
will set you free.

373
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:57,245
For I have promised
them a richer prize.

374
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:18,725
Good afternoon.

375
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,560
Who are you?

376
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:21,811
An appropriate
question, but I'm

377
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,022
afraid I'm the one who
should be doing the asking.

378
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,356
I'm invited in, of course.

379
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,360
What do you want of me?

380
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,905
You realize that this is the
property of the Baron Victor

381
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,114
von Leppe?

382
00:41:33,314 --> 00:41:34,866
And that it is forbidden
for any of the villagers

383
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:38,244
to set foot here, much
less make it their home.

384
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,537
How long have you
been living here?

385
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,707
Only two months.

386
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,417
Perhaps I should
tell you, you see,

387
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:45,877
I've just come
from Kleinschmidt,

388
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,462
where you are not
totally unknown.

389
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,842
You have lived here slightly
more than two years.

390
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,052
Your name is Katherina.

391
00:41:54,252 --> 00:41:55,252
And you originally
come from Colbin,

392
00:41:55,452 --> 00:41:56,387
where you were quite
unpopular because

393
00:41:56,597 --> 00:42:00,183
of, uh, certain activities.

394
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:03,269
They call you Katherina
the Heretic, the Witch.

395
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,855
They were fools.

396
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,065
Why do you live here?

397
00:42:07,265 --> 00:42:08,525
What do you want?

398
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,360
I haven't any money.

399
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:13,613
This was the only place that
wasn't burned to the ground.

400
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:16,991
So I- I brought
my things in here.

401
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,452
Where did you find the girl?

402
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:22,789
There's no girl.

403
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,499
I saw her.

404
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,293
She was sitting in this chair.

405
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,295
There is no girl!

406
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,422
I know what she is.

407
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:35,301
Old woman, I know what she is!

408
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,387
Listen to me, and listen
to me very carefully.

409
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:39,055
I don't know what you
want, nor do I fully

410
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,057
understand your black abilities.

411
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,434
But if the two of you have not
returned to Colbin within one

412
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:47,605
night, I shall come back and
kill you with my own hands,

413
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:51,609
and burn this place to the
ground once and for all.

414
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:55,029
Then you know who once lived
here all those years ago?

415
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,660
You know who lived here?

416
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,132
Is the Frenchman gone?

417
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,216
No.

418
00:43:15,416 --> 00:43:16,416
Why not?

419
00:43:16,616 --> 00:43:17,176
He now refuses to leave.

420
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:19,137
I don't think he will
leave of his own accord.

421
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,430
He must.

422
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,307
I gave you definite orders.

423
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,976
Baron, no one knows
this officer is here.

424
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,186
If he should never
arrive in Copeland-

425
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,063
Are you suggesting that-

426
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,940
It's the only way.

427
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,484
That I will never.

428
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,154
God knows I have enough
upon my conscience

429
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:39,616
without the senseless
murder of a young man who

430
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:40,825
never harmed me.

431
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,493
How do you know
what harm he plans?

432
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,370
You want him wandering
around the castle?

433
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,913
Do you want him
down in the crypt?

434
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:49,250
Enough, the crypt is
no concern of yours.

435
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:32,830
Andre?

436
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,293
Andre?

437
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,837
Help me.

438
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,010
Come to me.

439
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,514
Come to me, Andre.

440
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:51,724
I need you.

441
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,727
Where are you?

442
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:42,793
What is the meaning
of this intrusion?

443
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,003
I'm sorry, Baron.

444
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,963
I thought I heard voices.

445
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:49,967
Does that give you the right to
burst into my room unannounced?

446
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,928
I beg your pardon, Baron.

447
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:55,890
Stefan has gone to the village
to get you another horse.

448
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,392
It will save us both
embarrassment if you will

449
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,478
leave the moment he returns.

450
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,188
There can be no
doubt of it, sir.

451
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,952
Ilsa?

452
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,245
You're doing the best
thing, Lieutenant.

453
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,914
The Baron often
does things which

454
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,166
may seem strange to you and me.

455
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,794
But the death of the Baroness
was a severe shock to him,

456
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:27,129
one from which I fear he
has never fully recovered.

457
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,839
I understand
completely, Stefan.

458
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:40,601
Tell me something, Stefan.

459
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,603
If I can.

460
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:43,813
Who is Eric?

461
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,402
You recall the Baron spoke
of returning from the war

462
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:51,404
and finding the
Baroness with another?

463
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:52,613
Yes.

464
00:49:52,813 --> 00:49:54,073
Eric was that other.

465
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,781
Wait!

466
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,536
Gustav?

467
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:48,164
She has seen you.

468
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:51,125
She loves you.

469
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,210
You must help her.

470
00:52:57,257 --> 00:53:05,257
Tonight, her soul
cries out for release.

471
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:09,101
Go back.

472
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:10,287
I've waited for you so long.

473
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:13,916
I've been searching
for you to help you,

474
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:20,381
but you wander in strange
places at strange hours.

475
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,384
You're really here.

476
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:24,593
Of course I'm here.

477
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:28,305
And I'll never leave you again.

478
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:29,515
Never?

479
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:37,356
When the night
comes, I get cold.

480
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:43,696
My arms and my
shoulders get cold.

481
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:47,283
I don't like the night.

482
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:50,619
I want to be free of it.

483
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,246
You are free.

484
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:57,543
Only in here, in
this holy place.

485
00:54:57,752 --> 00:55:00,170
No, everywhere with me.

486
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,715
You must come away with me now.

487
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:07,970
No, I can't, not until-

488
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:10,973
Until what?

489
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,309
The crypt.

490
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:18,772
It must be destroyed,
and with it the dead.

491
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,399
Don't speak of
the dead anymore.

492
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:24,236
You're with me now.

493
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,363
I am possessed of the dead.

494
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,614
You're a warm, living woman.

495
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,867
Who has told you these things?

496
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,076
The dead.

497
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:33,829
In Paris, they're
doing wonderful things

498
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:37,458
to discover the
nature of the mind.

499
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:38,667
I'll take you there.

500
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:41,295
There are doctors who
can free you from this-

501
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,504
From the dead?

502
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:47,468
The dead cannot reach
out from the grave.

503
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:50,471
You must come away with me now.

504
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,097
No.

505
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,099
I'm afraid.

506
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,060
The night.

507
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:58,145
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

508
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,950
You see?

509
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,330
Love me and there is no fear.

510
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:21,001
Yes, I do love you.

511
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:26,006
Then come away with me.

512
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:43,857
Wait here.

513
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,567
It's all right.

514
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:33,527
Ilsa, my love,
you are not alone.

515
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:36,488
I am here with you now.

516
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:40,826
Soon, I will join
you in eternal sleep.

517
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:47,249
Stefan will flood the crypt
and seal us here together

518
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:48,667
with our love.

519
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:55,549
Ilsa?

520
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:56,758
Ilsa?

521
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,139
Ilsa?

522
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:04,600
Why do you not talk to me?

523
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:10,105
I am here.

524
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:13,483
I've been waiting for you.

525
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:16,153
My love, my love.

526
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,577
You know what you must do.

527
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,537
No, anything I will do.

528
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:27,080
But that, I dare not.

529
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,207
Do not ask me, I beg of you.

530
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:33,378
You must, or we
can never be together.

531
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:34,588
No, no, I cannot.

532
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:37,466
I dare not.

533
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:38,925
Look at me, Victor.

534
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:51,647
Why do you torment me so?

535
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:53,649
You must do it, Victor.

536
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:59,696
Only then can we be
together- only then, Victor.

537
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,615
I cannot.

538
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,700
I dare not.

539
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:07,788
My soul will be damned
to eternal perdition.

540
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,748
Let me see who you really are!

541
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:13,710
No!

542
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:14,795
No, go back!

543
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:15,796
You must not!

544
01:01:15,996 --> 01:01:16,996
No!

545
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:19,716
Let me go!

546
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:22,427
What kind of a woman are you?

547
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:26,306
Where you are you?

548
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:35,816
Who are you?

549
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,238
Helene?

550
01:01:57,588 --> 01:01:59,256
Is there a doctor
in the village?

551
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:01,717
his illness is
not of the flesh.

552
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:02,926
I have seen this before.

553
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:05,595
In a day or two, his
mind will return.

554
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,723
We can only wait.

555
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:09,307
The Baron tells me
you've been with him

556
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:12,686
since the Polish campaign.

557
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:15,063
That is true,

558
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:17,858
Then you must have been in
this castle for 20 years.

559
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:21,153
You must know every
section of the estate.

560
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:23,822
He's regaining consciousness.

561
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:27,951
No, he often moans
during these seizures.

562
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:29,786
You have keys.

563
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,289
Fetch them, I'd like
to see the chapel.

564
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:34,166
The chapel?

565
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:35,667
Yes, if you don't mind.

566
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:16,541
The hinges have rusted solid.

567
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,668
Do you have a crowbar?

568
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:19,878
Yes, come with me.

569
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:33,308
What is it?

570
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:36,228
That light there, that's
the Baroness's bedroom

571
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:37,687
in the tower.

572
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:39,689
The room has been sealed
ever since that night.

573
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:42,359
Not even the Baron would enter.

574
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:43,568
Come with me.

575
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:08,969
Where's the key?

576
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:12,472
Only the Baron has
the key to this lock.

577
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:13,723
Lieutenant, don't!

578
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,946
If the Baron should find out
we've entered this room-

579
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,792
Did the Baroness have a child?

580
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:42,002
I don't know.

581
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:43,211
I never though she did.

582
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:45,171
You spare me nothing.

583
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,468
Baron, if you'll permit me,
I think that I can explain.

584
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,053
Forgive me, Baron.

585
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:53,263
Stefan!

586
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:57,517
Take this gun.

587
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:00,020
Escort this gentleman
from the castle.

588
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:07,569
If he resists, kill him.

589
01:05:07,778 --> 01:05:09,613
Yes, Baron.

590
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:10,822
Lieutenant.

591
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:31,927
My love, my love.

592
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:33,345
I am here, Victor.

593
01:05:39,393 --> 01:05:42,228
I'm weary, Ilsa.

594
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:46,024
My soul cries out for relief.

595
01:05:46,233 --> 01:05:49,861
There is but one way, Victor.

596
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:55,617
No, the holy covenants
of God forbid it.

597
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:57,953
You will be forgiven.

598
01:05:58,162 --> 01:05:59,829
If I could be sure.

599
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:03,333
Take your life
as you took mine.

600
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:09,923
Let your own hand destroy you
and bring us together forever.

601
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:12,467
Forever.

602
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:15,303
No more torment,
Victor, forever.

603
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:18,890
Forever.

604
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,269
I will, Ilsa.

605
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:26,773
I will.

606
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,859
I promise you, Lieutenant, if
you return to von Leppe castle,

607
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:32,070
I shall not hesitate
to kill you.

608
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:11,943
Where is she?

609
01:07:12,143 --> 01:07:13,403
Let me be.

610
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:16,990
Why did you lie to
me about the girl?

611
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:23,204
Call it off.

612
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:31,046
It doesn't matter now.

613
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:32,839
You're too late.

614
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,591
Tonight, he damns himself.

615
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,762
Yes, even now she taunts
him to his own eternal doom.

616
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:42,057
You control the girl, just
as you control that bird.

617
01:07:42,266 --> 01:07:43,308
How?

618
01:07:43,517 --> 01:07:45,143
Mesmerism?

619
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:46,644
Mesmerism, you fool.

620
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:47,937
Why?

621
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:51,149
Answer me, old woman,
or I'll break your neck.

622
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:54,360
To avenge myself on
the Baron von Leppe.

623
01:07:54,570 --> 01:08:00,158
She will drive him to God's
one unpardonable sin- suicide.

624
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:01,367
For what offense?

625
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,119
What has the Baron done to you?

626
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:09,542
He killed my son, Eric.

627
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:11,002
Eric was your son?

628
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:13,129
Yes.

629
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:15,632
And tonight, the Baron
pays for Eric's life

630
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:19,177
with his own immortal soul!

631
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:23,014
She spoke of
destroying the crypt.

632
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:25,850
Too late, too late.

633
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:55,130
Baron!

634
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:57,465
Baron, you mustn't go- ah!

635
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:18,570
Baron!

636
01:09:39,216 --> 01:09:40,216
Where's the Baron?

637
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:41,301
We must get to him.

638
01:09:41,501 --> 01:09:42,677
He's locked himself
in the crypt.

639
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:44,679
Eric is avenged.

640
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:46,264
Eric avenged?

641
01:09:46,473 --> 01:09:50,226
She's used the girl as a puppet
to drive the Baron to suicide.

642
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:52,645
She thinks it was the
Baron that killed her son.

643
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,230
She never knew it was you.

644
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,440
What do you mean?

645
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,192
He killed my Eric!

646
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:59,194
Eric is her son?

647
01:09:59,403 --> 01:10:00,528
You murdered!

648
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:02,530
No, wait!

649
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:05,116
Don't you see now
it was all a lie?

650
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:08,119
The Baron did return that night
to find Eric with the Baroness.

651
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:09,329
And he did kill her.

652
01:10:09,529 --> 01:10:10,529
But there was a struggle.

653
01:10:10,729 --> 01:10:13,166
And in the fight, it was not
Eric who died, but the Baron!

654
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:15,126
I killed the Baron.

655
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:17,629
Then Eric is still alive?

656
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:18,838
He took the Baron's place.

657
01:10:18,964 --> 01:10:21,090
And for 20 years,
no one has known.

658
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:24,010
But he took the Baron's place
in mind as well as body.

659
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:27,305
In his mind, he is
the Baron von Leppe.

660
01:10:27,514 --> 01:10:31,226
The crypt- she's told
him to flood the cellars.

661
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:33,436
Now they'll both be killed.

662
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:34,979
Eric!

663
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:36,856
Flood the cellars, how?

664
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:40,193
There's a tunnel that leads
from the sea to the crypt.

665
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:41,402
Come with me.

666
01:10:58,837 --> 01:11:00,213
He's locked it from the inside.

667
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:14,936
You keep on here.

668
01:11:15,136 --> 01:11:16,646
I'll try and get in
through the chapel.

669
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:37,041
I may need you.

670
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:38,668
No, no, not the chapel!

671
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:40,378
I may not enter
the house of God!

672
01:11:40,587 --> 01:11:42,213
I have made my
pact with another!

673
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:44,424
No!

674
01:11:44,624 --> 01:11:45,624
No closer!

675
01:11:45,824 --> 01:11:47,176
No!

676
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:40,646
I'm here, Ilsa, my
love, this time forever.

677
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:43,274
Now, Victor, now.

678
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:44,734
I am waiting.

679
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:55,328
Hurry, Victor, hurry!

680
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:17,392
Now, Victor, bring
the sea into the crypt

681
01:13:17,601 --> 01:13:19,477
to mantle us forever.

682
01:13:38,872 --> 01:13:42,291
We will be together
again, Victor,

683
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:45,128
together with our love
here beneath the sea.

684
01:13:49,466 --> 01:13:50,967
Come to me, my love.

685
01:13:51,176 --> 01:13:53,302
Draw the veil.

686
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:55,513
Look at me.

687
01:13:55,722 --> 01:14:01,811
Come see how eagerly
I await your embrace.

688
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,696
What have you done to me?

689
01:14:11,905 --> 01:14:14,949
I have damned you
as you damned me.

690
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:17,618
The part of me that loved
you lies there, Victor,

691
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:20,204
rotting in the coffin.

692
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:21,581
Look at it.

693
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:24,167
See what your evil
love has done to me.

694
01:14:24,376 --> 01:14:27,503
And die with that
vision in your brain.

695
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:29,380
Why have you done this to me?

696
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:32,300
I am the spirit of Ilsa that
your unholy sin gave over

697
01:14:32,509 --> 01:14:35,011
to the dark powers.

698
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:37,388
But now, by giving your
immortal soul to them,

699
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:41,350
I will be free, Eric.

700
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:08,683
You're safe now.

701
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:13,854
It's over.

702
01:18:14,064 --> 01:18:15,064
It's over.

703
01:18:15,264 --> 01:18:16,264
Do you understand?

704
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,610
You're free now.

705
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:25,324
Free?

706
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:26,575
Andre.
