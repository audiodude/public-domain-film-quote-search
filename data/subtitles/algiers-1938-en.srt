1
00:01:33,813 --> 00:01:39,965
Where the blazing desert meets the blue Mediterranean and modern Europe jostles ancient Africa

2
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:46,730
.

3
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:54,094
.

4
00:01:54,107 --> 00:01:59,540
.

5
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:06,556
.

6
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:12,630
.

7
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:18,591
.

8
00:02:18,602 --> 00:02:21,556
.

9
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,989
I'm not interested in hearing excuses about local conditions.

10
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:29,653
No doubt there are local conditions.

11
00:02:29,653 --> 00:02:33,900
Here's a criminal whose exploits have made him notorious throughout Europe.

12
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,530
He escaped from France

13
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,590
with a fortune in jewels. And for two years, he's been living here in Algiers,

14
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,404
within a stone's throw of your headquarters.

15
00:02:41,404 --> 00:02:44,138
As you say commissioner.
I'm here to settle this.

16
00:02:44,138 --> 00:02:45,436
I want it done quickly.

17
00:02:45,436 --> 00:02:48,375
We've been trying to settle the case of Pepe le Moko for two years.

18
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:51,325
In Paris, we handle more difficult cases every day.

19
00:02:51,325 --> 00:02:53,801
Too bad you couldn't arrest him before he escaped from France.

20
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:55,330
Merely an oversight, no doubt.

21
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,391
Do you deal in riddles here?
Indeed we do.

22
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:00,052
Oriental riddles.

23
00:03:00,052 --> 00:03:03,727
From my experience, there's no problem in surrounding a given area.

24
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:07,141
You close in, and you make a house-to-house investigation.

25
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,757
A house-to-house investigation?

26
00:03:12,187 --> 00:03:13,870
You just arrived from Paris, commissioner.

27
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,626
You're not familiar with the Casbah.
Casbah? What's that?

28
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:19,202
Some kind of nut?
A very hard nut to crack.

29
00:03:19,202 --> 00:03:21,552
You see. Pepe le Moko lives in the Casbah.

30
00:03:21,552 --> 00:03:24,709
Why not go in and take him out of it?
You can't arrest a king in his own palace.

31
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,859
Pepe is well guarded.

32
00:03:25,897 --> 00:03:27,013
Let me show you.

33
00:03:27,031 --> 00:03:28,316
Fantastic.

34
00:03:28,328 --> 00:03:30,001
As a civilized man, you don't like fantasy.

35
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:33,247
As a police officer, I don't believe in it.
But here it is.

36
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,241
The native quarter known as the Casbah.

37
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:38,881
As you look at it here, it's just a few lines on the map.

38
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:43,276
But the reality is something stranger than anything you could have dreamed.

39
00:03:43,276 --> 00:03:46,059
It's only a step from the modern city, the Casbah.

40
00:03:46,087 --> 00:03:49,003
But when you take that step, you enter another world.

41
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:51,751
A melting pot for all the sins of the earth.

42
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,098
Seen from a bird's eye view, the Casbah is a great staircase.

43
00:03:56,572 --> 00:03:59,125
Each step is a terrace rising from the sea.

44
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:01,342
If you observe more closely,

45
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,460
you'll see that those terraces and courtyards and twisted streets

46
00:04:04,488 --> 00:04:06,928
are like a crawling anthill,

47
00:04:06,957 --> 00:04:08,248
a jungle of houses,

48
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,865
a labyrinth of narrow passages and winding alleys

49
00:04:11,882 --> 00:04:13,261
rotten with vermin

50
00:04:13,315 --> 00:04:16,156
and decay from the filth of centuries.

51
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,891
No one knows what mysteries are hidden behind those walls.

52
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,316
No one knows what crimes and hopes

53
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:24,386
are buried in those secret courtyards.

54
00:04:24,636 --> 00:04:27,493
Forty thousand inhabitants from all over the world.

55
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:29,844
Some have been settled here for generations.

56
00:04:30,744 --> 00:04:32,601
There are Kabulis in their white robes,

57
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:34,716
Chinese faithful to Confucius,

58
00:04:34,744 --> 00:04:37,220
Gypsies with their fortune telling and their songs,

59
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,915
and there are many Czechos,

60
00:04:38,915 --> 00:04:40,790
and there are Slavs far from home,

61
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:42,339
and Maltese,

62
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:44,911
Negroes from every corner of Africa,

63
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:48,602
Sicilians and Spaniards, hot-blooded and quick to hate,

64
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:50,267
and women,

65
00:04:50,267 --> 00:04:52,936
women of every age and every shape,

66
00:04:52,936 --> 00:04:55,446
women caught in the neck of the Casbah.

67
00:04:55,446 --> 00:04:57,923
And everywhere there are terraces,

68
00:04:57,938 --> 00:05:00,900
all connected together so that those who are accepted

69
00:05:00,936 --> 00:05:04,507
can move to any part of the Casbah without using the street.

70
00:05:04,507 --> 00:05:06,866
The terraces are the domain of the native women

71
00:05:06,888 --> 00:05:10,471
and it would be dire for a foreigner to go there unless he was known and protected.

72
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:14,589
The Casbah rises like a fortress from the sea,

73
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:17,660
colorful, sordid, dangerous.

74
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,220
There isn't just one Casbah.

75
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:21,496
There are hundreds,

76
00:05:21,527 --> 00:05:22,954
a thousand.

77
00:05:22,954 --> 00:05:24,616
And in that labyrinth,

78
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:27,073
Pepe le Moko is at home,

79
00:05:27,073 --> 00:05:29,404
and he's safe as long as he stays there.

80
00:05:29,436 --> 00:05:32,381
You mean to say that you don't go into this quarter?

81
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:34,306
It's easy to go in.

82
00:05:34,306 --> 00:05:37,392
Sometimes, it's no so easy to come out.

83
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:39,399
You cross the dead line.

84
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,626
Suddenly,

85
00:05:40,626 --> 00:05:42,515
a bullet hits you feet.

86
00:05:42,515 --> 00:05:45,299
It's just a friendly suggestion.

87
00:05:46,426 --> 00:05:48,694
Don't take the next step.

88
00:05:48,694 --> 00:05:50,544
From a roof up above,

89
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:52,561
a voice speaks.

90
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,282
Hello, inspector.

91
00:05:54,282 --> 00:05:56,256
How did he know you were there?

92
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,004
Don't ask us.

93
00:05:58,004 --> 00:06:00,677
Ask Inspector Slimane.

94
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:03,269
The Casbah is his territory.

95
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:05,631
How does Pepe le Moko conceal himself?

96
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:07,768
Disguise, no doubt.

97
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,400
You don't know Pepe.

98
00:06:09,424 --> 00:06:11,292
He'd laugh at a disguise.

99
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:12,390
Then why don't you find him?

100
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:15,448
Oh, but that is singularly easy.

101
00:06:15,494 --> 00:06:17,006
I see him every day.

102
00:06:17,006 --> 00:06:17,780
What?

103
00:06:18,027 --> 00:06:20,591
Our distinguished colleague is disturbed.

104
00:06:20,621 --> 00:06:24,751
The man is wanted in all the capitals of Europe, and you see him every day.

105
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,911
Another example of what you call the local condition.

106
00:06:27,932 --> 00:06:30,583
Gross inefficiency. No effort to make an arrest.

107
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:34,141
To arrest him in the Casbah, distinguished colleague, would be simple.

108
00:06:34,183 --> 00:06:36,279
To get him out would be impossible.

109
00:06:36,304 --> 00:06:37,861
So, you do nothing.

110
00:06:37,861 --> 00:06:41,359
I flatter myself that I do a great deal in my humble way.

111
00:06:41,373 --> 00:06:45,531
I learn about Pepe. I know his habits. I study his weaknesses.

112
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:49,408
When one can't use guns, one must work with brains.

113
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,018
I prefer guns.

114
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,889
In your case, honored sir, such a preference is unavoidable.

115
00:06:54,907 --> 00:06:59,479
By his looks, I'd say he was too lazy to make an arrest.
I'm merely careful.

116
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,346
Which means to say you're looking after your own skin.

117
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:04,260
It's the only skin I have.

118
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,613
So Pepe le Moko wouldn't amuse me.

119
00:07:06,657 --> 00:07:07,782
We'll find out.

120
00:07:07,813 --> 00:07:11,159
I want twelve men tonight, inspected and ready for work.

121
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:14,435
And you might prepare a special cell for Pepe le Moko.

122
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:18,372
You and I have the same feeling, Pepe, for beauty.

123
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:22,135
This pearl belongs on a very special kind of ear,

124
00:07:22,165 --> 00:07:24,062
like a pink shell

125
00:07:24,088 --> 00:07:26,916
with a little curl of gold hair,

126
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,919
a special kind of gold.

127
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,907
I can see it.

128
00:07:35,743 --> 00:07:36,531
No.

129
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:39,195
Pearls don't suit you at all, Carlos.

130
00:07:39,195 --> 00:07:40,334
You're not the type.

131
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,121
He'd look better with rings in his ears.

132
00:07:42,121 --> 00:07:43,416
Yes, and one in his nose.

133
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,192
He is definitely uncouth.

134
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:47,073
You took the words out of my mouth.

135
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,880
He's trying to cheat us, Pepe.

136
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,494
All his talk is so he can get a better price,

137
00:07:51,494 --> 00:07:53,298
so he can make fools of us.

138
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:54,533
Yes.

139
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:56,614
So he's here to make a fool of me.

140
00:07:56,614 --> 00:07:58,943
Why don't you try it some time?

141
00:07:58,943 --> 00:08:01,269
Grandpere dealt with us for two years.

142
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:03,517
We must have confidence in each other.

143
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,972
That's the way to get along.

144
00:08:04,972 --> 00:08:09,149
That's the truth, Pepe.
Well, why don't we get our money and be done with it?

145
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:11,532
He doesn't speak our language.

146
00:08:11,576 --> 00:08:13,224
Pretend he is not here.

147
00:08:13,273 --> 00:08:15,254
Yes, but I am here.

148
00:08:15,254 --> 00:08:17,467
He doesn't know he's not here.

149
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:21,160
One more thing he doesn't know will make it practically a perfect score.

150
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,440
He was talking about beauty.

151
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:25,756
The more he talks about beauty,

152
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:27,498
the less he talks about money.

153
00:08:27,527 --> 00:08:29,411
And I'm talking about how much.

154
00:08:29,411 --> 00:08:30,833
Oh, you make me sick.

155
00:08:30,846 --> 00:08:31,723
What?

156
00:08:31,758 --> 00:08:33,241
Say that again.

157
00:08:33,241 --> 00:08:35,243
You make me sick.

158
00:08:35,243 --> 00:08:37,070
Since you make him sick...

159
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:40,849
Ok.

160
00:08:43,185 --> 00:08:43,809
Look,

161
00:08:43,832 --> 00:08:45,045
but don't touch.

162
00:08:45,045 --> 00:08:47,423
You know, this was once my trade.

163
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:49,409
I began life in a jewelry store.

164
00:08:49,427 --> 00:08:52,802
And when you left you took the store with you.
Yeah, it became a habit.

165
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:55,929
You know, I dream about sitting down in Paris sometime.

166
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,696
I'd make a collection of things like this.

167
00:08:57,721 --> 00:08:58,862
Not just for myself,

168
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:00,160
for people to see

169
00:09:00,177 --> 00:09:01,167
in glass cases.

170
00:09:02,232 --> 00:09:04,668
With you in a uniform taking care of them together.

171
00:09:04,682 --> 00:09:05,691
And you, Max.

172
00:09:06,877 --> 00:09:07,861
Me?

173
00:09:07,905 --> 00:09:08,955
You, Pierrot.

174
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:11,437
Oh, you'd have a uniform like a general,

175
00:09:11,477 --> 00:09:13,493
and you'd be in charge of everything.

176
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:14,715
What about me?

177
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:18,356
What would he be?

178
00:09:19,203 --> 00:09:20,872
Stuffed in a glass case?

179
00:09:20,914 --> 00:09:21,620
What?

180
00:09:22,086 --> 00:09:23,565
Say that again.

181
00:09:24,182 --> 00:09:26,108
Stuffed in a glass case.

182
00:09:26,153 --> 00:09:27,983
Like an Egyptian mummy.

183
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:32,526
Ok.

184
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:44,861
Hey.

185
00:09:45,296 --> 00:09:45,826
Police !

186
00:09:46,177 --> 00:09:47,025
Police !

187
00:09:50,698 --> 00:09:51,750
Police !

188
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,659
Police !

189
00:10:06,046 --> 00:10:06,935
Ah !

190
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:22,793
You.

191
00:10:22,793 --> 00:10:23,763
Where's Pepe le Moko?

192
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:24,963
(speaks in arabic "moi...

193
00:10:25,175 --> 00:10:26,273
I don't know him")

194
00:10:42,724 --> 00:10:43,576
Cuff him.

195
00:10:44,214 --> 00:10:45,217
Uh, uh.

196
00:10:46,423 --> 00:10:48,349
Where's Pepe le Moko?
I don't know.

197
00:10:48,762 --> 00:10:51,709
By the sword of the Great Prophet, I haven't set eyes on him in two weeks.

198
00:10:51,745 --> 00:10:53,973
He hasn't let me look on his face in two weeks.

199
00:10:53,973 --> 00:10:54,708
Let him go.

200
00:11:04,385 --> 00:11:05,614
Grandpere?

201
00:11:05,646 --> 00:11:06,346
Who is he?

202
00:11:06,368 --> 00:11:07,689
Receiver of stolen goods.

203
00:11:07,742 --> 00:11:09,098
Do you know where his place is?

204
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:09,831
We know it.

205
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:33,091
Pepe?

206
00:11:33,136 --> 00:11:33,839
No.

207
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,622
It's Regis.

208
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:41,101
What's the matter?

209
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:42,051
The police.

210
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:43,146
They're looking for Pepe.

211
00:11:43,146 --> 00:11:44,059
So soon?

212
00:11:44,096 --> 00:11:46,561
Soon? Were you expecting them?
Always.

213
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:50,665
But especially tonight. Pepe said they sent someone all the way from Paris.

214
00:11:50,887 --> 00:11:51,807
So he knew?

215
00:11:51,856 --> 00:11:53,968
Of course. Pepe knows everything.

216
00:11:53,997 --> 00:11:55,556
You're. You're going to him?

217
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,808
Tell him I've never seen so many.

218
00:11:58,255 --> 00:11:59,228
He'll laugh.

219
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:00,962
That's what he expected.

220
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,455
Look. Look at my neck.

221
00:12:02,475 --> 00:12:04,947
I thought they were going to wring it like a chicken.

222
00:12:04,976 --> 00:12:06,973
But all the time I thought only if Pepe

223
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:10,559
kill me. I thought so long as Pepe.
Why should you feel that way about Pepe?

224
00:12:12,055 --> 00:12:12,769
Don't you?

225
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:13,870
I?

226
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:16,977
Everyone knows how I feel about Pepe.

227
00:12:16,992 --> 00:12:20,029
Pepe doesn't like me. He ignores me. Humiliates me.

228
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:23,713
But I have my revenge. Sometime he'll be sorry he didn't notice me sooner.

229
00:12:23,772 --> 00:12:24,844
Oh, I'm very humble.

230
00:12:24,887 --> 00:12:27,142
I do my best to serve him in my own way.

231
00:12:27,176 --> 00:12:28,842
That's nice of you, Regis.

232
00:12:28,842 --> 00:12:29,958
That's how I am.

233
00:12:29,998 --> 00:12:32,146
Sensitive. But no one appreciates me.

234
00:12:32,189 --> 00:12:34,488
Promise me you'll tell him that I came to warn you.

235
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:35,442
I will.

236
00:12:35,576 --> 00:12:36,813
I don't want any favors.

237
00:12:36,847 --> 00:12:39,782
I only want him to know that where there's trouble,

238
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:41,229
look for Regis.

239
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:02,135
Third door on the left.

240
00:13:03,754 --> 00:13:05,333
Take three men. Cover the roof.

241
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,534
You men go 'round the back.

242
00:14:27,126 --> 00:14:28,515
It's Ines. Quick.

243
00:14:38,635 --> 00:14:41,892
The police on the roof, Pepe. They're coming.

244
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:45,094
They surrounded the house. They know you're here.

245
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:46,696
That's funny.

246
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:49,080
How did they know I was here?

247
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:54,021
Oh, one can't meditate in peace anymore. Always rush and bustle.

248
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:55,003
I'll take this one.

249
00:14:55,036 --> 00:14:55,846
I rather like it.

250
00:15:00,898 --> 00:15:02,121
You think that's a toy?

251
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:03,868
No.
When will you learn to obey orders?

252
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:08,473
See.

253
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,624
Don't take so many chances.

254
00:15:10,807 --> 00:15:11,774
That's foolish.

255
00:15:12,219 --> 00:15:14,237
I don't want a bullet to come between us,

256
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,007
the way that one almost did.

257
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,964
Break it down.

258
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,211
Every few weeks, I have to get new doors.

259
00:16:00,856 --> 00:16:01,609
Ines.

260
00:16:02,872 --> 00:16:04,677
Did you tell anyone where I was?

261
00:16:04,706 --> 00:16:06,004
No one, Pepe.

262
00:16:06,027 --> 00:16:06,812
Are you sure?

263
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,976
Try to remember.

264
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,781
Why don't you believe me, Pepe?

265
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,369
All I want is to please you.

266
00:16:11,717 --> 00:16:13,106
I couldn't lie to you.

267
00:16:15,056 --> 00:16:15,656
Couldn't you?

268
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:19,394
What about all that time you kept telling me that you didn't like me?

269
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,046
But this is serious.

270
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:25,651
Ah, so, love is not serious?
Pepe, it's serious if someone told the police.

271
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:28,988
I didn't talk to anyone. I stayed at home until Regis came.

272
00:16:29,515 --> 00:16:30,192
Who came?

273
00:16:30,248 --> 00:16:31,002
Regis.

274
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:31,874
Ahhh.

275
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:33,930
As soon as he told me, I ran to you.

276
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:37,135
What did Regis tell you?
Oh, about the police.

277
00:16:37,171 --> 00:16:38,840
He wanted me to warn you.

278
00:16:39,214 --> 00:16:40,175
It was nice of him.

279
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,684
That's what I thought.

280
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,049
Was that all you thought?

281
00:16:44,057 --> 00:16:46,205
Wsa there anything else for me to think?

282
00:16:47,622 --> 00:16:49,458
That's what I like about you.

283
00:16:49,711 --> 00:16:50,572
What?

284
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,332
Nevermind.

285
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,598
This seems to be all.

286
00:17:10,634 --> 00:17:11,651
All for me.

287
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:13,055
Search the place.

288
00:17:24,365 --> 00:17:25,322
Hold out your hand.

289
00:17:28,658 --> 00:17:29,479
Don't grab.

290
00:17:29,504 --> 00:17:30,576
It's unlucky.

291
00:17:30,594 --> 00:17:32,466
You want to give it to me, Pepe?

292
00:17:34,871 --> 00:17:35,489
No.

293
00:17:35,942 --> 00:17:37,824
It's for some fat, old woman.

294
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:40,835
Let me have it, Pepe. Some time, I'll get fat.

295
00:17:40,835 --> 00:17:42,541
You'll lose it before that.

296
00:17:42,653 --> 00:17:44,371
I'll keep it for a charm.

297
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:45,906
Then you must keep your fingers crossed.

298
00:17:45,906 --> 00:17:46,803
Alright.

299
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:53,947
So.

300
00:17:55,646 --> 00:17:58,649
This ring will mean that I'm always yours, Pepe,

301
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,819
with my fingers crossed.

302
00:18:03,295 --> 00:18:04,230
(crashing sound)

303
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:07,586
Those baboons are turning my house upside down.

304
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,700
They'll be here next.

305
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:10,676
Let's get out.

306
00:18:10,727 --> 00:18:12,110
No, you stay here.

307
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:14,057
When the police come, you know what to say.

308
00:18:18,226 --> 00:18:19,116
No evidence?

309
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:19,667
Nothing.

310
00:18:20,047 --> 00:18:22,635
Are you satisfied?
I'm never satisfied.

311
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:24,687
Take your men back to the roof.

312
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:26,105
The rest of you follow me.

313
00:18:30,966 --> 00:18:31,824
There they go.

314
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,210
This way quickly.

315
00:19:49,384 --> 00:19:50,289
Come in.

316
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,758
Make yourself comfortable.

317
00:19:51,785 --> 00:19:53,235
What is this? What happened?

318
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,503
Oh, it's nothing.

319
00:19:54,503 --> 00:19:56,172
You call this nothing?

320
00:19:56,205 --> 00:19:57,684
Oh, you know how the police are.

321
00:19:57,722 --> 00:19:59,404
They like to keep everything in an uproar.

322
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,966
A very profound observation.

323
00:20:09,828 --> 00:20:12,847
The police have been trying to catch him for two years.

324
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,744
Police must be rather stupid.

325
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:18,452
As one of them, I consider that a triumph of understatement.

326
00:20:18,474 --> 00:20:19,673
You're one of them?

327
00:20:19,673 --> 00:20:21,468
I have that doubtful honor.

328
00:20:21,468 --> 00:20:22,600
How does he do it?

329
00:20:22,614 --> 00:20:23,541
Mademoiselle.

330
00:20:23,564 --> 00:20:26,118
It's not his head that saves him. It's his heart.

331
00:20:26,155 --> 00:20:28,943
A man with such a good heart could get around anywhere.

332
00:20:28,943 --> 00:20:30,532
Sounds intriguing.

333
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:33,099
It's a matter of taste.

334
00:20:36,843 --> 00:20:38,914
Oh, inspector.

335
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,293
Fix it up.

336
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,630
Permit me to hope that it's nothing serious.

337
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,654
Thanks.

338
00:20:56,654 --> 00:20:58,198
A flea bite.

339
00:21:28,897 --> 00:21:30,996
Why aren't you chasing the fox?

340
00:21:30,996 --> 00:21:32,963
Oh, such a silly business.

341
00:21:32,963 --> 00:21:34,912
I prefer to use my brains.

342
00:21:34,912 --> 00:21:37,675
Well, your friends did a little better than usual tonight.

343
00:21:37,675 --> 00:21:39,901
At least they found me. That's pretty good for them.

344
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:42,086
Shall we say a step in the right direction?

345
00:21:42,086 --> 00:21:44,888
Excuse us madam if we talk shop.

346
00:21:44,922 --> 00:21:45,777
Cigarette?

347
00:21:45,777 --> 00:21:46,509
Please.

348
00:21:56,304 --> 00:21:57,333
Let me help you.

349
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:03,347
So.

350
00:22:03,754 --> 00:22:05,218
They surrounded the house?

351
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:06,487
Yes.

352
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,353
They thought I was at Grandpere's.

353
00:22:10,709 --> 00:22:11,758
Poor old man.

354
00:22:11,758 --> 00:22:12,997
He has no luck.

355
00:22:12,997 --> 00:22:15,176
They won't even let him sleep in peace.

356
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:17,652
Sometimes, I feel sorry for them.

357
00:22:17,702 --> 00:22:20,018
They'll never get me by this technique, you know.

358
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,648
I've tried to point that out to them.

359
00:22:23,862 --> 00:22:25,345
For once we agree,

360
00:22:25,374 --> 00:22:26,967
the inspector and I.

361
00:22:27,006 --> 00:22:28,952
I am the one who will get you Pepe,

362
00:22:28,987 --> 00:22:30,220
in the end.

363
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,288
I can hardly wait for the day.

364
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:34,557
And not only you, but the others,

365
00:22:34,557 --> 00:22:37,838
Pierrot, Carlos, Grandpere, all of you.

366
00:22:37,922 --> 00:22:39,722
And then what will you do?

367
00:22:39,722 --> 00:22:41,614
Put us in the zoo?

368
00:22:41,642 --> 00:22:43,293
You flatter yourself.

369
00:22:43,293 --> 00:22:44,597
Oh, you mean

370
00:22:44,626 --> 00:22:46,791
you won't show me in a cage?

371
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:49,239
You're important now because you're free.

372
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,469
Once you're behind bars, people will forget all about you.

373
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:56,166
He is funny, my friend Slimane.

374
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,897
He looks normal, doesn't he?

375
00:22:57,897 --> 00:23:01,479
But he has delusions of grandeur. He thinks he can arrest me.

376
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,843
That's exactly what I'm going to do Pepe.

377
00:23:05,404 --> 00:23:06,797
Sure.

378
00:23:06,797 --> 00:23:09,254
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure.

379
00:23:10,238 --> 00:23:11,616
How you make me laugh.

380
00:23:12,342 --> 00:23:13,804
Do you know what I like about you?

381
00:23:13,804 --> 00:23:16,594
No, but I'm humbly waiting for you to tell me.

382
00:23:16,594 --> 00:23:17,998
Your face.

383
00:23:17,998 --> 00:23:20,830
It's a perfect face for your job.

384
00:23:20,856 --> 00:23:24,147
To look that false is almost the equivalent of being honest.

385
00:23:24,184 --> 00:23:26,583
I'm honored that my appearance pleases you.

386
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:27,520
Don't mention it.

387
00:23:32,823 --> 00:23:34,092
You'll excuse me?

388
00:23:34,136 --> 00:23:35,583
I'm afraid I have to go.

389
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,612
Business.

390
00:23:43,042 --> 00:23:44,140
Goodnight, Pepe.

391
00:23:49,702 --> 00:23:51,083
It's a shame, isn't it?

392
00:23:51,107 --> 00:23:51,757
What?

393
00:23:51,801 --> 00:23:53,123
A waste of talent.

394
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:55,248
An unusual intelligence.

395
00:23:55,287 --> 00:23:57,567
One hates to see him buried so young.

396
00:23:57,567 --> 00:23:58,560
Buried?

397
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:00,065
It's the same thing.

398
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:02,354
What makes you so sure?

399
00:24:02,354 --> 00:24:06,534
I've marked the date of his arrest on the wall of my room.

400
00:24:06,534 --> 00:24:08,155
High.

401
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,725
Where it reads black in the rays of the setting sun.

402
00:24:13,121 --> 00:24:13,923
Shall we go?

403
00:24:20,663 --> 00:24:24,353
And although we narrowly missed capturing Pepe le Moko,

404
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:26,914
he was evidently wounded while escaping.

405
00:24:26,957 --> 00:24:29,654
In fact, his injuries may prove fatal.

406
00:24:30,331 --> 00:24:34,093
In the event of his death, I shall inform you without delay.

407
00:24:34,093 --> 00:24:36,720
Why don't you just declare him dead and be done with it?

408
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:40,550
You may rest assured that I have the situation well in hand

409
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,469
and will take whatever steps I deem advisable.

410
00:24:43,469 --> 00:24:45,659
Wire that to Paris immediately.

411
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,067
What does he mean by saying he has the situation well in hand?

412
00:24:55,113 --> 00:24:57,896
He means he's going to sit here and write letters to Paris,

413
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:00,053
while he waits for Pepe to die of old age.

414
00:25:00,053 --> 00:25:02,590
That's better than going into the Casbah looking for him.

415
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:05,719
At least our friend from Paris has learned something about the Casbah.

416
00:25:05,751 --> 00:25:08,423
We've all learned that there's only one way to arrest Pepe.

417
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,570
Oh, that's very intelligent of you.

418
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,661
As you know, my intelligence is at your service.

419
00:25:12,661 --> 00:25:14,508
Well so far, it's hardly been enough.

420
00:25:14,578 --> 00:25:15,651
Ah, but wait.

421
00:25:15,651 --> 00:25:17,556
Suppose Pepe comes out of the Casbah.

422
00:25:17,585 --> 00:25:20,014
Then it follows, his arrest is a matter of child's play.

423
00:25:20,014 --> 00:25:22,657
Shall we send him an engraved invitation?

424
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,556
Pepe is too clever to fall into a trap,

425
00:25:26,556 --> 00:25:28,540
but some of his friends are not so clever.

426
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,528
Get to the point.

427
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,985
Suppose Pierrot comes down into the town,

428
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,627
Pepe would be worried about his absence,

429
00:25:34,655 --> 00:25:36,675
and he'll come down into the town to find him.

430
00:25:36,675 --> 00:25:39,832
You've overlooked just one little point. How do you get Pierrot to come down?

431
00:25:39,832 --> 00:25:41,700
Ah, that's my plan.

432
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,230
Magnificent plan.

433
00:25:44,157 --> 00:25:45,917
I have here a letter.

434
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:47,600
I got it from Pierrot.

435
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,981
But he doesn't know that.

436
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,252
The letter is from his mother.

437
00:25:50,293 --> 00:25:52,328
A letter of exquisite tenderness.

438
00:25:52,373 --> 00:25:53,417
From France.

439
00:25:54,556 --> 00:25:55,951
Can't see much value in that.

440
00:25:56,005 --> 00:25:57,824
He's a bad boy but a good son.

441
00:25:57,869 --> 00:25:59,890
So it isn't the good son that we'll lock up,

442
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:00,800
but the bad boy.

443
00:26:00,844 --> 00:26:02,504
Then, we keep the arrest a secret

444
00:26:02,572 --> 00:26:05,429
and Pepe will come down out of the Casbah to look for Pierrot.

445
00:26:07,574 --> 00:26:08,547
Are we agreed?

446
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,025
Agreed.

447
00:26:12,265 --> 00:26:13,692
And...

448
00:26:13,692 --> 00:26:15,353
as to the price?

449
00:26:15,353 --> 00:26:17,097
You know the reward has been posted.

450
00:26:17,097 --> 00:26:19,149
But a little bonus besides

451
00:26:19,192 --> 00:26:21,306
in view of the circumstances?

452
00:26:21,338 --> 00:26:22,022
Agreed.

453
00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:26,956
How do we know we can trust you not to make a better bargain with Pepe?

454
00:26:27,527 --> 00:26:28,854
I'm an informer

455
00:26:28,907 --> 00:26:30,022
not a hypocrite.

456
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,442
What are you laughing at?

457
00:26:33,442 --> 00:26:37,184
It amuses me to see you sell your friend at bargain prices.

458
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:39,370
You have a flair for business, Regis.

459
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:45,109
He says that because he's jealous. It doesn't upset me.

460
00:26:45,774 --> 00:26:46,835
I ignore him.

461
00:27:08,256 --> 00:27:10,375
Double him, dear. He'll never make it.

462
00:27:13,852 --> 00:27:15,119
Good morning, Tanya.

463
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:17,677
Good morning, Inspector.
And how is Carlos?

464
00:27:17,707 --> 00:27:18,904
How would he be?

465
00:27:18,947 --> 00:27:22,294
Don't tell me your charming husband has been beating you again.

466
00:27:22,324 --> 00:27:24,021
You know how it is with a man.

467
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,897
Well, I can't say I do.

468
00:27:25,951 --> 00:27:27,845
Thay seem to take to it naturally.

469
00:27:32,973 --> 00:27:34,211
Morning, pretty.

470
00:27:34,211 --> 00:27:35,572
Good morning, Pepe.

471
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:37,670
Good morning, Pepe.

472
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,847
Hello.

473
00:27:38,847 --> 00:27:40,775
Good morning, Pepe.

474
00:27:40,775 --> 00:27:42,067
Good morning.

475
00:27:42,067 --> 00:27:43,631
You better watch out, Pepe.

476
00:27:43,631 --> 00:27:46,391
Women will be the death of you.
It's a happy death.

477
00:27:46,391 --> 00:27:47,935
I'm just warning you.

478
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,814
Don't worry. I'll keep my head.

479
00:27:51,453 --> 00:27:53,271
I may need it one of these days.

480
00:27:53,302 --> 00:27:54,181
No doubt.

481
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:55,218
Coming my way?

482
00:27:55,294 --> 00:27:56,233
With pleasure.

483
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:03,559
Good morning, Pepe.

484
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:04,232
Morning.

485
00:28:05,937 --> 00:28:07,157
Good morning, Pepe.

486
00:28:07,972 --> 00:28:08,510
Morning.

487
00:28:09,805 --> 00:28:11,806
Did you get home safely last night?

488
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:12,668
Why not?

489
00:28:12,703 --> 00:28:13,767
Morning, Pepe.

490
00:28:13,767 --> 00:28:14,416
Morning.

491
00:28:15,676 --> 00:28:16,964
Nothing unpleasant?

492
00:28:17,003 --> 00:28:19,856
Yes, we had one rather unpleasant experience.

493
00:28:19,856 --> 00:28:20,642
Yeah?

494
00:28:20,642 --> 00:28:21,727
With you.

495
00:28:21,727 --> 00:28:23,098
She didn't think so.

496
00:28:23,139 --> 00:28:25,644
What makes you so sure?
What is she saying?

497
00:28:25,687 --> 00:28:28,831
Well, you know women. They talk about nothing. I hardly listen.

498
00:28:28,831 --> 00:28:31,816
Was there anything special about her?

499
00:28:31,894 --> 00:28:32,786
Yes.

500
00:28:32,835 --> 00:28:33,569
Pearls.

501
00:28:34,257 --> 00:28:35,660
The corner I like.

502
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:38,270
Handcuffs I can appreciate.

503
00:28:38,313 --> 00:28:39,510
Platinum and diamonds.

504
00:28:40,097 --> 00:28:42,682
And she didn't buy that perfume in Algiers.

505
00:28:43,218 --> 00:28:45,933
So all you noticed were the jewels and perfume.

506
00:28:45,965 --> 00:28:47,270
Was there anything else?

507
00:28:47,301 --> 00:28:49,366
What about the eyes?

508
00:28:49,366 --> 00:28:50,839
They all have eyes,

509
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,474
but all that shi shi and jingle,

510
00:28:52,502 --> 00:28:54,356
you don't see much of that in the Casbah.

511
00:28:54,389 --> 00:28:56,171
But you do where she comes from.

512
00:28:56,215 --> 00:28:56,821
Thank you.

513
00:29:02,681 --> 00:29:05,195
She asked quite a few questions about you.

514
00:29:05,195 --> 00:29:07,567
Yeah? What did you tell her?

515
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,131
What could I tell her?

516
00:29:09,168 --> 00:29:12,452
Why? Did you think she might be afraid of my past?

517
00:29:12,452 --> 00:29:15,670
No, but she might be a little appalled at your future.

518
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,688
I told her you might get off in 20 years with a good lawyer.

519
00:29:18,688 --> 00:29:23,863
You wouldn't want me to get 20 years. You're too fond of me. What's her name?

520
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:26,441
So, you're thinking about her.

521
00:29:26,478 --> 00:29:29,656
How could I be thinking about her when I don't know her name?

522
00:29:35,075 --> 00:29:36,969
-Good morning, Pepe.
-Hello, Aicha.

523
00:29:36,969 --> 00:29:38,108
Pierrot at home?

524
00:29:38,108 --> 00:29:39,135
No, he's at Shinee's.

525
00:29:39,135 --> 00:29:40,556
Let's go to Shinee.

526
00:29:44,352 --> 00:29:45,157
What do you want?

527
00:29:47,072 --> 00:29:48,566
I have a letter for Pierrot.

528
00:29:48,645 --> 00:29:49,428
Give it to me.

529
00:29:49,428 --> 00:29:51,671
Oh, no no no. I can't.

530
00:29:51,671 --> 00:29:55,567
I swore by the ghosts of my ancestors to give it only to Pierrot.

531
00:29:55,617 --> 00:29:56,832
Whose the letter from?

532
00:29:57,528 --> 00:29:58,633
A woman.

533
00:29:58,633 --> 00:29:59,779
What kind of a woman?

534
00:29:59,873 --> 00:30:01,171
I didn't look.

535
00:30:01,229 --> 00:30:03,024
Well, you tell the woman I took it away from you.

536
00:30:03,057 --> 00:30:04,624
(humming)

537
00:30:09,829 --> 00:30:12,380
(humming)

538
00:30:15,603 --> 00:30:20,498
This vulgar game is hardly worth the compromise to ones dignity involved in playing it.

539
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,448
It's vulgar, but it's fast.

540
00:30:22,476 --> 00:30:26,279
I don't know why I waste my time in such common pursuits

541
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:28,618
with such mediocre companions.

542
00:30:30,424 --> 00:30:32,075
My youth?

543
00:30:32,075 --> 00:30:34,359
I intended to become a statesman.

544
00:30:34,389 --> 00:30:35,237
Or?

545
00:30:35,577 --> 00:30:36,206
Philosopher.

546
00:30:37,762 --> 00:30:40,421
But a man's destiny is written in the stars.

547
00:30:53,954 --> 00:30:55,412
We play the game.

548
00:30:55,758 --> 00:30:58,269
But Fate controls the cards.

549
00:30:58,797 --> 00:30:59,418
Who?

550
00:31:00,021 --> 00:31:00,672
Fate.

551
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:04,488
If Fate goes on controlling the cards,

552
00:31:04,524 --> 00:31:07,088
he might find a knife between his ribs.

553
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:17,894
The moving finger writes.

554
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:21,450
Ans having writ

555
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,990
moves on.

556
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:24,565
Stop that nonsense.

557
00:31:25,681 --> 00:31:28,200
He has an ear but not for poetry.

558
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,968
I'm trying to think.

559
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:39,527
I would have played the ace.

560
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:43,360
Do you smell something?

561
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,469
I've been wondering.

562
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:45,319
Onions.

563
00:31:45,365 --> 00:31:47,791
Cheese.
A mixture of cheese and onions.

564
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:48,725
I don't like it.

565
00:31:49,063 --> 00:31:52,211
Would it be to much to ask you to take your nose out of my hand?

566
00:31:52,247 --> 00:31:53,987
But you haven't got a hand.

567
00:31:54,025 --> 00:31:55,550
Don't blow down my back.

568
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,592
You seem nervous.

569
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,568
My dear fellow,

570
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,137
consider yourself blackballed by this club.

571
00:32:02,204 --> 00:32:03,441
He means get out.

572
00:32:04,768 --> 00:32:05,537
Oh.

573
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,907
What are you hanging around for? This is business.

574
00:32:15,095 --> 00:32:15,826
Read this.

575
00:32:16,084 --> 00:32:16,979
Bad news?

576
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:19,917
Pierrot.

577
00:32:20,947 --> 00:32:21,532
Wait for me.

578
00:32:27,433 --> 00:32:30,292
I would like it better if you didn't hang around so much

579
00:32:30,317 --> 00:32:31,214
with Regis.

580
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:31,822
Why?

581
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:37,557
Did you ever see a clock that pointed to two and struck four

582
00:32:37,593 --> 00:32:39,567
when it is really quarter past twelve?

583
00:32:39,654 --> 00:32:40,337
Well,

584
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:41,895
you will find Regis is like that.

585
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:44,256
He doesn't ring two.

586
00:32:44,521 --> 00:32:46,339
That's what you say, but you can't prove it.

587
00:32:46,386 --> 00:32:47,034
Well.

588
00:32:47,251 --> 00:32:48,992
If I say so, that's enough.

589
00:32:49,072 --> 00:32:50,735
Regis gets along alright with me.

590
00:32:50,788 --> 00:32:52,410
That's why I'm telling you. I don't like it.

591
00:32:52,444 --> 00:32:53,191
Well I do.

592
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:54,807
In business, I'll do anything you say, Pepe.

593
00:32:54,845 --> 00:32:56,601
But outside business I'll do as I please.

594
00:32:57,145 --> 00:32:59,098
Oh, so.

595
00:33:00,865 --> 00:33:02,761
You'll do as you please?

596
00:33:07,973 --> 00:33:09,142
It's a good thing I like you.

597
00:33:09,932 --> 00:33:10,653
Now get out.

598
00:33:16,755 --> 00:33:17,645
Nice kid.

599
00:33:20,076 --> 00:33:21,906
What did she write you in her last letter?

600
00:33:21,906 --> 00:33:24,620
She had a cold. She said she'd start as soon as she felt better.

601
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,275
Ah, then you knew she was coming.

602
00:33:26,275 --> 00:33:27,264
I sent her a money order.

603
00:33:27,264 --> 00:33:28,928
In that case, it isn't so strange.

604
00:33:28,928 --> 00:33:31,643
And yet it's odd that she should arrive in Algiers like that

605
00:33:31,699 --> 00:33:32,777
without letting you know,

606
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:34,307
That's what I thought.
Ah.

607
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:35,986
Is this her handwriting?

608
00:33:36,244 --> 00:33:37,413
Have you another letter?

609
00:33:37,866 --> 00:33:40,700
Yes, I think so.
Good. We'll put them both together

610
00:33:40,754 --> 00:33:42,536
like a pair of Siamese twins.

611
00:33:42,568 --> 00:33:45,036
Then we'll see if they're both from the same mama.

612
00:33:50,494 --> 00:33:51,477
Well, what do you think?

613
00:33:51,504 --> 00:33:53,245
Same mistakes in spelling.

614
00:33:53,277 --> 00:33:56,087
Our poor dear mamas can never spell.

615
00:33:56,087 --> 00:33:57,170
Same 'n'.

616
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:57,978
Same what?

617
00:33:57,978 --> 00:33:58,710
Same 'n'.

618
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,383
And the crossing of the 't'.

619
00:34:00,435 --> 00:34:03,250
Well, that settles it. You can always tell by the crossing of the 't'.

620
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,922
Then, you think it's alright?
Well, you can see with your own eyes.

621
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,079
Then, I don;t want her to be there worrying.

622
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:11,042
-After all, she's 62.
-Oh, my mother lived to 84.

623
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:14,147
She never felt better than the day she died.

624
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:16,857
Where's that?

625
00:34:16,857 --> 00:34:18,606
If I know it well, half hour's walk.

626
00:34:18,645 --> 00:34:20,788
I can take you there if you wish to go.

627
00:34:21,734 --> 00:34:23,449
I've got to go. I've got to see her.

628
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:25,480
Fortunately, you can rely on me.

629
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,007
It's good of you to help me, Regis.

630
00:34:27,037 --> 00:34:28,096
You're a real friend.

631
00:34:28,096 --> 00:34:29,504
Well, that's how I am. Sensitive.

632
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:47,315
You ready, Gaby?

633
00:34:47,341 --> 00:34:49,992
Andre just phoned. They're waiting on the terrace.

634
00:34:49,992 --> 00:34:52,637
If I sat for five minutes, Andre phones.

635
00:34:52,685 --> 00:34:54,829
Well, don't you like having him so attentive?

636
00:34:55,943 --> 00:34:56,676
Love it.

637
00:34:57,905 --> 00:34:59,442
I've just been sitting here,

638
00:34:59,478 --> 00:35:02,046
thinking that I'm the happiest girl in the world.

639
00:35:02,082 --> 00:35:02,917
Well, you ought to be.

640
00:35:03,636 --> 00:35:07,905
Marrying a man who adores you and can give you everything in the world you ever dreamed about.

641
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:09,894
That's my trouble.

642
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,809
I'm such a fool.

643
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,725
I go dreaming about the wrong things.

644
00:35:14,754 --> 00:35:16,460
Well, that's a terrible mistake.

645
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:17,941
Marie,

646
00:35:18,432 --> 00:35:19,581
remember the time

647
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,914
in the Baltoin Bargain Basement.

648
00:35:22,012 --> 00:35:24,600
The two of behind a counter. Handkerchiefs. Gloves.

649
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,825
Hosiery.

650
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,166
And don't you forget it.

651
00:35:31,127 --> 00:35:32,454
I won't.

652
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,184
After all, you don't marry for fun.

653
00:35:39,779 --> 00:35:40,589
I didn't.

654
00:35:42,864 --> 00:35:44,570
Hello, Inspector.

655
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,845
So you've already met.

656
00:35:45,882 --> 00:35:48,173
I took the liberty of presenting myself.

657
00:35:48,785 --> 00:35:52,687
As you see, I couldn't wait to take advantage of your invitation last night.

658
00:35:52,721 --> 00:35:53,719
I'm glad.

659
00:35:53,941 --> 00:35:55,016
Yes, we're all glad.

660
00:35:56,016 --> 00:35:56,890
Inspector,

661
00:35:56,905 --> 00:36:00,579
will you tell my fiance where I was last night during the shooting?

662
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,524
But with me.

663
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:02,894
There you see?

664
00:36:02,923 --> 00:36:04,271
And who did we meet?

665
00:36:04,504 --> 00:36:05,528
Pepe le Moko.

666
00:36:05,551 --> 00:36:07,123
Nice friends you have.

667
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,123
In prisoners, one can't choose.

668
00:36:09,772 --> 00:36:11,370
You don't mean Pepe le Moko,

669
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:12,741
the famous criminal?

670
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:15,010
The one they're all talking about?

671
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:18,225
He'd like to hear you say that.
Just a common law-breaker.

672
00:36:19,957 --> 00:36:21,253
Have you seen him since?

673
00:36:22,637 --> 00:36:23,791
This morning.

674
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,805
Did he say anything bout me?

675
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:27,624
Well, in a way.

676
00:36:27,792 --> 00:36:29,327
Oh, I know.

677
00:36:29,466 --> 00:36:30,456
My pearls.

678
00:36:30,456 --> 00:36:34,204
A connoisseur can admire pearls without neglecting the wearer.

679
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,292
Oh, he means if he stole your pearls, he'd steal you with them.

680
00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:39,709
Does that frighten you, Gaby?

681
00:36:39,737 --> 00:36:41,517
Oh, it sounds marvelous to me.

682
00:36:41,544 --> 00:36:42,491
I'd like to meet him.

683
00:36:42,511 --> 00:36:44,472
It could easily be arranged

684
00:36:45,363 --> 00:36:49,114
if you wish to visit the Casbah again with a suitable guide.

685
00:36:49,136 --> 00:36:50,874
How's that, Andre? An adventure.

686
00:36:50,874 --> 00:36:52,888
Well, that's what we're here for.

687
00:36:52,927 --> 00:36:55,337
Once is enough for me. I don't like natives.

688
00:36:55,553 --> 00:36:59,030
Then, we'll go with Maxim. You'll protect us. Won't you, Maxim?

689
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,990
I'm at my best among natives.

690
00:37:03,705 --> 00:37:05,956
Tonight, Inspector? If it's convenient.

691
00:37:05,977 --> 00:37:07,109
Uh huh.

692
00:37:07,802 --> 00:37:08,759
Pepe.

693
00:37:09,043 --> 00:37:10,194
Yes.

694
00:37:10,232 --> 00:37:11,523
What are you doing?

695
00:37:11,986 --> 00:37:12,962
Nothing.

696
00:37:23,553 --> 00:37:25,255
What are you looking at like that?

697
00:37:25,804 --> 00:37:26,263
France.

698
00:37:26,706 --> 00:37:28,220
You can't see France.

699
00:37:29,483 --> 00:37:31,283
Well, there is no harm in trying.

700
00:37:32,139 --> 00:37:34,230
Pepe, what are you looking at like that?

701
00:37:34,493 --> 00:37:35,372
A ship.

702
00:37:36,498 --> 00:37:38,914
Doesn't it make you seasick to look at boats?

703
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,903
Doesn't it give you a headache to ask so many questions?

704
00:37:41,903 --> 00:37:42,478
No.

705
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,946
Why? Have you got a headache?

706
00:37:45,366 --> 00:37:47,108
No. I'm thinking.

707
00:37:48,468 --> 00:37:50,471
Well, that's sure to give you a headache.

708
00:37:51,094 --> 00:37:53,970
I don't think with my head but with my heart.

709
00:37:54,006 --> 00:37:55,388
Then, you'd better tell me.

710
00:37:55,424 --> 00:37:56,394
It's nothing.

711
00:37:56,434 --> 00:37:58,152
If it's nothing, you'd better tell me.

712
00:37:58,268 --> 00:38:00,267
Oh, I'll get mad if you go on like this.

713
00:38:00,295 --> 00:38:01,772
I want you to get mad.

714
00:38:01,802 --> 00:38:02,935
Shout at me and hurt me,

715
00:38:02,979 --> 00:38:05,058
but don't treat me as if I'm not here.

716
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:08,512
Oh, I know you're here.
No you don't.

717
00:38:16,591 --> 00:38:18,488
You're dreaming about something

718
00:38:18,488 --> 00:38:20,193
with your eyes wide open.

719
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,897
I wish you'd dream about me.

720
00:38:27,132 --> 00:38:27,728
Look.

721
00:38:27,776 --> 00:38:29,790
You've always lived in the Casbah.

722
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,041
For you, there is nothing outside.

723
00:38:32,724 --> 00:38:34,422
The Casbah is big enough.

724
00:38:34,472 --> 00:38:35,534
Not for me.

725
00:38:36,318 --> 00:38:38,204
It's like being in a grave.
Pepe.

726
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:40,221
Can't stand much more of it.

727
00:38:40,831 --> 00:38:43,083
If you want to go away, I'll go with you.

728
00:38:45,398 --> 00:38:45,931
Thanks.

729
00:38:47,717 --> 00:38:48,956
Won't you take me?

730
00:38:49,677 --> 00:38:50,964
I wish I could.

731
00:38:53,974 --> 00:38:55,505
Paris is a long way off.

732
00:38:55,545 --> 00:38:56,703
I don't care.

733
00:38:57,481 --> 00:38:58,700
It's different there.

734
00:39:01,129 --> 00:39:03,681
Couldn't you be happy with me in Paris?

735
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,724
You think I'd look funny in Paris.

736
00:39:12,162 --> 00:39:13,191
Answer me.

737
00:39:13,191 --> 00:39:14,963
Oh, but it isn't you, Ines.

738
00:39:15,072 --> 00:39:16,119
It's the Casbah.

739
00:39:16,143 --> 00:39:17,563
You belong here.

740
00:39:17,915 --> 00:39:19,382
You don't understand the way I feel.

741
00:39:21,305 --> 00:39:23,318
I've stood it for two years.

742
00:39:23,934 --> 00:39:26,355
The time comes when you can't stand anymore.

743
00:39:27,087 --> 00:39:28,964
Morning, noon, and night.

744
00:39:29,332 --> 00:39:31,445
The same things. The same people.

745
00:39:31,487 --> 00:39:32,645
I'm fed up.

746
00:39:32,687 --> 00:39:33,774
I've had enough.

747
00:39:33,822 --> 00:39:34,842
You're tired of me.

748
00:39:34,904 --> 00:39:36,409
It has nothing to do with you.

749
00:39:36,436 --> 00:39:37,533
I want to get away.

750
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:40,814
That has nothing to do with me?

751
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:45,946
Do you know when you're going away? Never.
You'll see.

752
00:39:45,946 --> 00:39:47,079
You can't do it.

753
00:39:47,117 --> 00:39:48,198
Never.

754
00:39:49,074 --> 00:39:51,153
I am the Casbah. I'll keep you.

755
00:39:51,191 --> 00:39:53,942
Just try to get away and you will find out.

756
00:39:53,981 --> 00:39:57,033
It's funny for the police to come in and try to arrest you.

757
00:39:57,082 --> 00:40:00,343
You're in prison already. You're in the Casbah with the wall around you.

758
00:40:00,343 --> 00:40:01,189
Stop it.

759
00:40:01,189 --> 00:40:02,798
There's nothing else. You'll never have anything else.

760
00:40:02,798 --> 00:40:03,790
Stop it I tell you.

761
00:40:03,803 --> 00:40:07,767
I am glad. There is no France for you. No Paris. No boulevards.

762
00:40:07,767 --> 00:40:09,207
Are you through?
No.

763
00:40:45,052 --> 00:40:45,738
Who is it?

764
00:40:46,563 --> 00:40:47,274
Pierrot?

765
00:40:47,508 --> 00:40:48,941
It's me, Aicha

766
00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:09,698
Pepe.

767
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,214
I don't know what to do.

768
00:41:11,398 --> 00:41:12,316
Pierrot.

769
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:13,699
I can't find him.

770
00:41:14,251 --> 00:41:15,687
Did you go to Shinee's?

771
00:41:15,687 --> 00:41:16,178
Yes.

772
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:18,583
And I Mother Teche's and the Ali Baba

773
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:20,387
and the Algerians.

774
00:41:20,387 --> 00:41:21,883
Everywhere.

775
00:41:21,883 --> 00:41:24,423
-He ought to be back by now.
-Back?

776
00:41:26,121 --> 00:41:29,231
Why did he go into town?

777
00:41:29,231 --> 00:41:30,656
To see his mother.

778
00:41:33,273 --> 00:41:35,217
What do you mean to see his mother?

779
00:41:35,246 --> 00:41:36,538
He got a letter from her.

780
00:41:36,596 --> 00:41:37,716
L'Arbi brought it.

781
00:41:37,778 --> 00:41:39,271
Then, he went down with Regis.

782
00:41:39,304 --> 00:41:41,492
And then Regis came back, but Pierrot

783
00:41:42,368 --> 00:41:44,513
I'm still waiting for him, that's all.

784
00:41:46,386 --> 00:41:47,261
Where's Regis?

785
00:41:47,282 --> 00:41:48,446
At the Algerians.

786
00:41:48,902 --> 00:41:50,631
No need to go down.

787
00:42:03,306 --> 00:42:04,142
See you later.

788
00:42:08,657 --> 00:42:09,729
Hello, Regis.

789
00:42:09,779 --> 00:42:10,562
What's your hurry?

790
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:11,736
Oh, I'm in no hurry.

791
00:42:11,783 --> 00:42:13,389
Good. Then, come along with me.

792
00:42:13,389 --> 00:42:15,572
I'm waiting for Pierrot. We can wait for him together.

793
00:42:15,572 --> 00:42:17,224
But listen, Pepe. I've got to go down.

794
00:42:17,224 --> 00:42:19,764
What's the matter? What makes you so nervous?

795
00:42:19,806 --> 00:42:20,810
Me? Nervous?

796
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:21,992
Why should I be nervous?

797
00:42:22,031 --> 00:42:23,298
That's just it. Why?

798
00:42:23,409 --> 00:42:28,359
Well. It's only that usually you hardly say hello to me and when you do so I don't expect it when you don't.

799
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:30,730
I'm a little surprised when you do because you don't usually.

800
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:34,198
Well, you see. I haven't appreciated you at your real value.

801
00:42:34,253 --> 00:42:35,188
That's the trouble.

802
00:42:35,217 --> 00:42:36,768
So, I made a mistake.

803
00:42:36,806 --> 00:42:37,766
Shall we go?

804
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:40,739
Where?
Oh, any quiet corner where we can talk.

805
00:42:40,781 --> 00:42:43,530
I've been hearing great stories about your courage.

806
00:42:43,565 --> 00:42:44,534
My courage?

807
00:42:45,108 --> 00:42:47,479
You're surprised?
No.

808
00:42:47,528 --> 00:42:50,284
I even hear you proved it.
Me?
Yes, you.

809
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:54,543
Well, it's possible. One can be brave without knowing it.

810
00:42:54,588 --> 00:42:55,746
Of course.

811
00:42:55,746 --> 00:42:59,135
How? How did I prove it?

812
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:01,839
Why by going down into town with Pierrot.

813
00:43:01,894 --> 00:43:04,516
Ah, not everybody would have done that.

814
00:43:04,516 --> 00:43:06,381
Oh, yes.

815
00:43:06,381 --> 00:43:08,661
And after that you came back here.

816
00:43:08,661 --> 00:43:10,690
That was a brave thing to do.

817
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:12,665
Yes. Wasn't it?

818
00:43:15,939 --> 00:43:17,270
Now you see

819
00:43:17,305 --> 00:43:20,363
why I have completely changed my ideas about you.

820
00:43:20,419 --> 00:43:21,483
You're right.

821
00:43:21,518 --> 00:43:24,387
I was helping the boy out. Nothing more.
Of course.

822
00:43:28,115 --> 00:43:29,220
Tell me.

823
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:31,563
Where did you leave Pierrot?

824
00:43:31,879 --> 00:43:33,811
Somewhere. I don't quite remember.

825
00:43:37,661 --> 00:43:38,588
That's it.

826
00:43:39,308 --> 00:43:41,622
You don't mind if I refresh your memory, do you?

827
00:43:41,665 --> 00:43:43,699
He went to see his poor old mother.

828
00:43:43,967 --> 00:43:44,785
How is she?

829
00:43:44,818 --> 00:43:46,391
I didn't see her.

830
00:43:46,422 --> 00:43:47,087
Why not?

831
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:51,365
She was in bed sick. He didn't want to disturb her.

832
00:43:52,083 --> 00:43:54,324
It must have been an awful shock for Pierrot.

833
00:43:54,356 --> 00:43:55,865
He thought she was in France.

834
00:43:56,285 --> 00:43:57,448
I think he got a letter.

835
00:43:58,295 --> 00:43:59,248
Did you see it?

836
00:44:01,628 --> 00:44:03,797
Just a glimpse.

837
00:44:04,624 --> 00:44:05,844
So you left him?

838
00:44:06,389 --> 00:44:07,627
And you came back alone.

839
00:44:08,343 --> 00:44:09,846
He wanted to stay with her.

840
00:44:10,269 --> 00:44:11,780
That's natural.

841
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:14,739
Yes, very natural.

842
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:16,543
Exactly.

843
00:44:17,215 --> 00:44:17,850
Of course.

844
00:44:29,906 --> 00:44:31,053
Want me?

845
00:44:31,759 --> 00:44:33,329
No, we're just talking.

846
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:34,103
Sit down.

847
00:44:37,755 --> 00:44:40,199
Regis did a fine thing today.

848
00:44:40,243 --> 00:44:42,603
He went down into town with Pierrot.

849
00:44:43,353 --> 00:44:44,612
Fine.

850
00:44:47,207 --> 00:44:49,414
And now you're waiting for poor Pierrot.

851
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:52,750
Why poor Pierrot?
Because he went down with Regis.

852
00:44:52,826 --> 00:44:53,648
What of it?

853
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:54,913
Nothing.

854
00:44:55,653 --> 00:44:57,011
Maybe I should say

855
00:44:57,062 --> 00:44:58,880
and now you're waiting for Pierrot

856
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,544
with poor Regis.

857
00:45:28,219 --> 00:45:30,108
What's the matter? Huh?

858
00:45:31,522 --> 00:45:33,135
I've gotta have air.

859
00:45:34,278 --> 00:45:35,448
Just relax.

860
00:45:35,618 --> 00:45:36,906
Take it easy.

861
00:45:37,084 --> 00:45:40,703
We understand how anxious you are about Pierrot. Here.

862
00:45:41,091 --> 00:45:41,854
Take this.

863
00:45:46,444 --> 00:45:47,644
Go ahead. Drink.

864
00:45:49,131 --> 00:45:51,231
Don't take a bite out of it.

865
00:45:52,563 --> 00:45:53,885
I don't know what's the matter with me.

866
00:45:53,922 --> 00:45:54,899
You'll get over it.

867
00:45:55,602 --> 00:45:57,297
In an hour, you'll feel much better.

868
00:45:57,694 --> 00:45:59,283
Let me go.

869
00:45:59,334 --> 00:46:00,659
Let me go.

870
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,611
With a fever like that?

871
00:46:02,808 --> 00:46:05,460
You musn't think of exerting yourself.

872
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:06,393
Cigarette?

873
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,546
Don't make such a fuss.

874
00:46:08,589 --> 00:46:10,201
Go on and smoke.

875
00:46:10,238 --> 00:46:11,946
It'll settle your nerves.

876
00:46:12,726 --> 00:46:13,992
Say, Pepe.

877
00:46:14,176 --> 00:46:16,881
His hair is getting a little long here on his neck.

878
00:46:16,925 --> 00:46:19,081
Don't you think we ought to cut it for him?

879
00:46:19,552 --> 00:46:21,504
You were fond of Pierrot, weren't you?

880
00:46:21,557 --> 00:46:23,262
Oh, I was. I am fond of him.

881
00:46:23,376 --> 00:46:24,576
Well, then.

882
00:46:24,617 --> 00:46:26,827
You don't want to leave before he gets back.

883
00:46:27,068 --> 00:46:29,058
You want to know why he has been detained.

884
00:46:29,098 --> 00:46:30,890
-Don't you?
-Yes yes yes.

885
00:46:34,066 --> 00:46:35,616
Must be the fever.

886
00:46:36,176 --> 00:46:37,509
I'm worried about you.

887
00:46:37,764 --> 00:46:38,965
He's burning up.

888
00:46:39,253 --> 00:46:41,617
I'm afraid he'll sizzle before too long.

889
00:46:44,114 --> 00:46:45,687
I don't know anything about Pierrot.

890
00:46:45,841 --> 00:46:50,190
Pepe. Pepe. Let me go. You know me; you know I'm alright.

891
00:46:50,222 --> 00:46:52,788
Tell me you do. Last night, I was the one who came to warn you.

892
00:46:52,788 --> 00:46:55,045
Yes, you were the one.
Let me go.

893
00:46:57,955 --> 00:47:00,877
He's delirious.
This is terrible.

894
00:47:00,877 --> 00:47:02,989
He may not last the next round.

895
00:47:04,173 --> 00:47:07,497
How about a little game to calm him down?
Alright.

896
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,251
It is really alarming.

897
00:47:10,508 --> 00:47:13,498
If I may say so, he is not at his best.

898
00:47:14,135 --> 00:47:15,980
He must stay right where he is.

899
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:17,965
We can't be too careful.

900
00:47:23,773 --> 00:47:24,947
What are you doing?

901
00:47:24,983 --> 00:47:25,898
Ines.

902
00:47:29,877 --> 00:47:31,908
Try to find him, and bring him back. Quick.

903
00:47:32,577 --> 00:47:33,684
He went down with Regis.

904
00:47:34,247 --> 00:47:35,520
If you bring him back,

905
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,945
Regis may recover.

906
00:47:38,343 --> 00:47:39,481
Alright.

907
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:46,462
Cut 'em, Regis.

908
00:47:56,133 --> 00:47:57,525
The black spot.

909
00:47:58,716 --> 00:48:00,799
Oh, that's bad.

910
00:48:06,611 --> 00:48:08,386
Suppose you can't find him.

911
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:09,281
Don't worry.

912
00:48:20,293 --> 00:48:21,045
This way.

913
00:48:27,222 --> 00:48:29,001
The women look so mysterious.

914
00:48:29,055 --> 00:48:31,292
No doubt they'd say the same about you.

915
00:48:44,135 --> 00:48:44,676
Trump?

916
00:48:45,341 --> 00:48:46,620
But you've got a heart.

917
00:48:47,472 --> 00:48:49,130
What's the matter with me? I'm not myself.

918
00:48:49,166 --> 00:48:51,229
What kind of a game is this?

919
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:52,352
Concentrate.

920
00:48:52,379 --> 00:48:54,812
He's thinking of Pierrot.
Yes, of course.

921
00:48:54,845 --> 00:48:58,730
Worry about a friend can cause unutterable anguish to a sensitive nature.

922
00:48:58,765 --> 00:49:00,485
Do you mean it makes him sweat?

923
00:49:00,509 --> 00:49:04,647
A certain exudation hyper-actuated by an emotional stimulation.

924
00:49:04,676 --> 00:49:06,127
You don't mean him?

925
00:49:06,172 --> 00:49:07,384
Deal me out.

926
00:49:07,432 --> 00:49:08,324
Take care of Regis.

927
00:49:08,374 --> 00:49:10,780
Never go back on a friend when he is in trouble.

928
00:49:12,428 --> 00:49:13,779
Still waiting, little one?

929
00:49:47,904 --> 00:49:51,763
You know what this reminds me of? A little place in New York on 42nd street.

930
00:49:51,798 --> 00:49:53,278
That's the thing about travelling.

931
00:49:53,303 --> 00:49:54,666
There's always something different.

932
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:57,620
One time, I was in Corsica and I thought I was in Turkey.

933
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:01,215
Remember the time we were on the Nile and I thought it was Venice?

934
00:50:03,108 --> 00:50:06,552
Tell me. Do they have native music here?

935
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:07,916
On the phonograph.

936
00:50:07,916 --> 00:50:10,092
Oh. Well.

937
00:50:25,157 --> 00:50:25,939
What's that one?

938
00:50:28,095 --> 00:50:29,495
Never heard of it.

939
00:50:29,999 --> 00:50:31,350
Must be native music.

940
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,731
So you wanted to take another look at this strange, wild animal.

941
00:50:39,488 --> 00:50:40,295
Strange

942
00:50:40,557 --> 00:50:41,895
but not so very wild.

943
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,300
How do you like my cage?

944
00:50:44,355 --> 00:50:46,100
I don't know. Yet.

945
00:50:46,855 --> 00:50:47,957
Do you like Algiers.

946
00:50:48,268 --> 00:50:50,481
I don't like travelling; makes me homesick.

947
00:50:50,533 --> 00:50:51,195
Does it?

948
00:50:51,594 --> 00:50:54,244
I can't see Paris when I open my eyes in the morning.

949
00:50:54,326 --> 00:50:55,954
I want to go right back to sleep.

950
00:50:57,071 --> 00:50:58,696
Do you know Paris?

951
00:51:00,987 --> 00:51:02,711
Do I know Paris?

952
00:51:05,601 --> 00:51:07,350
Now is summertime.

953
00:51:07,402 --> 00:51:08,654
Champs-Élysées.

954
00:51:08,695 --> 00:51:09,919
La Gare du Nord.

955
00:51:09,973 --> 00:51:11,995
The Opéra, Boulevard des Capucines

956
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:14,411
La Chapelle

957
00:51:14,453 --> 00:51:15,500
Rue Montmartre

958
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:17,173
Boulevard de Rochechouart

959
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:18,395
Rue Fontaine

960
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:20,258
La Place Blanche.

961
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:24,968
What a small world.

962
00:51:34,051 --> 00:51:34,894
Cigarette?

963
00:51:34,989 --> 00:51:35,563
Thanks.

964
00:51:38,727 --> 00:51:39,636
Got a light?

965
00:51:43,057 --> 00:51:45,824
We are a long way from home.

966
00:51:48,781 --> 00:51:49,664
Excuse me.

967
00:51:54,967 --> 00:51:55,689
Well?

968
00:51:56,556 --> 00:51:59,197
He still thinks he's playing his last card.

969
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,110
Not bad.

970
00:52:01,186 --> 00:52:02,240
I'll tell her you said so.

971
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:04,724
No no no. I mean the rock she's wearing.

972
00:52:04,763 --> 00:52:08,619
Now if it was me, I'd get them first and then do the fancy stuff afterward.

973
00:52:08,619 --> 00:52:09,435
Shut up

974
00:52:09,435 --> 00:52:11,283
You can't talk to me like that.

975
00:52:11,283 --> 00:52:12,558
You heard me. Shut up.

976
00:52:15,853 --> 00:52:17,246
Okay.

977
00:52:20,496 --> 00:52:22,027
He was talking about me.

978
00:52:22,071 --> 00:52:23,317
He was worried about you.

979
00:52:23,362 --> 00:52:24,359
About me?

980
00:52:24,399 --> 00:52:25,943
All that stuff you're holding.

981
00:52:27,289 --> 00:52:28,426
That's nice of him.

982
00:52:28,464 --> 00:52:29,748
You're not worried yourself?

983
00:52:29,825 --> 00:52:31,117
No.

984
00:52:31,675 --> 00:52:33,111
Not while I'm with you.

985
00:52:35,448 --> 00:52:36,101
Right.

986
00:52:38,578 --> 00:52:39,714
This is something.

987
00:52:39,714 --> 00:52:42,688
Isn't it? And it hardly weighs anything.

988
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:46,074
At least

989
00:52:46,074 --> 00:52:47,911
20,000 francs.

990
00:52:47,911 --> 00:52:49,231
Add a zero.

991
00:52:49,231 --> 00:52:52,248
I mean what I would get for it.

992
00:52:53,662 --> 00:52:54,562
Here.

993
00:52:55,074 --> 00:52:56,130
Put it on again.

994
00:52:57,478 --> 00:52:58,747
You put it on.

995
00:53:33,356 --> 00:53:34,400
Want to dance?

996
00:53:34,827 --> 00:53:35,613
Yes.

997
00:53:59,516 --> 00:54:00,516
What's your name?

998
00:54:00,554 --> 00:54:01,644
Gabrielle.

999
00:54:01,644 --> 00:54:02,750
They call me Gabby.

1000
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:03,580
Married?

1001
00:54:03,929 --> 00:54:04,515
No.

1002
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:05,488
Widowed?

1003
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:06,229
No.

1004
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:06,957
Why not?

1005
00:54:07,662 --> 00:54:08,642
Who are you with?

1006
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,722
My fiance.

1007
00:54:09,798 --> 00:54:10,725
What is he like?

1008
00:54:10,778 --> 00:54:11,632
Generous.

1009
00:54:12,723 --> 00:54:13,820
Stuck being at the hotel?

1010
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:14,771
I let him.

1011
00:54:16,893 --> 00:54:18,207
What are you laughing at?

1012
00:54:18,207 --> 00:54:19,410
It's nothing.

1013
00:54:19,582 --> 00:54:21,243
-Too bad.
-Too bad?

1014
00:54:21,307 --> 00:54:22,928
Too bad I don't know you better.

1015
00:54:22,988 --> 00:54:23,868
Why?

1016
00:54:23,909 --> 00:54:25,661
Because I will slap your face.

1017
00:54:26,017 --> 00:54:28,476
When people laugh around me, I like to know why.

1018
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:37,659
This all reminds me of when I was a kid.

1019
00:54:38,343 --> 00:54:40,148
We used to dance in the streets

1020
00:54:40,182 --> 00:54:42,979
on holidays, New Years, first of May.

1021
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:44,635
14th of July.

1022
00:54:45,109 --> 00:54:46,093
Why do you know?

1023
00:54:46,132 --> 00:54:47,419
What do you think I was doing?

1024
00:54:47,892 --> 00:54:51,159
Too bad you weren't in my
 neighbourhood, Rue de la Bruyère

1025
00:54:51,159 --> 00:54:52,272
Rue de la Bruyère?

1026
00:54:52,312 --> 00:54:53,075
That's where I lived.

1027
00:54:53,075 --> 00:54:54,588
I went to school on the hill.

1028
00:54:54,588 --> 00:54:56,836
That was almost next door to me.

1029
00:54:56,899 --> 00:54:57,866
No.

1030
00:55:07,475 --> 00:55:08,261
Let's go out.

1031
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:10,028
Where to?

1032
00:55:10,076 --> 00:55:11,079
To the terrace.

1033
00:55:14,751 --> 00:55:16,120
Can you see the harbor?

1034
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,196
You can see Montmartre.

1035
00:55:17,325 --> 00:55:18,587
And Les Champs-Élysées.

1036
00:55:18,626 --> 00:55:19,918
And Place Blanche.

1037
00:55:20,607 --> 00:55:22,190
I love Place Blanche.

1038
00:55:23,489 --> 00:55:24,456
Oh, I can't.

1039
00:55:24,694 --> 00:55:26,248
I can't leave my friends.

1040
00:55:29,925 --> 00:55:31,077
But I'll come back.

1041
00:55:31,395 --> 00:55:32,108
When?

1042
00:55:32,153 --> 00:55:33,627
As soon as I can.

1043
00:55:33,656 --> 00:55:34,334
When?

1044
00:55:35,756 --> 00:55:36,738
Tomorrow.

1045
00:55:37,539 --> 00:55:38,751
How can I be sure?

1046
00:55:39,582 --> 00:55:41,153
I never break a promise.

1047
00:55:45,038 --> 00:55:45,968
Let me go.

1048
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:48,002
Why should I?

1049
00:55:49,203 --> 00:55:50,334
'Cause I ask you.

1050
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:52,816
Say please.

1051
00:55:54,731 --> 00:55:55,808
You're rude.

1052
00:55:57,644 --> 00:55:58,526
Am I?

1053
00:56:07,185 --> 00:56:08,301
I'll be expecting you.

1054
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:09,856
Here.

1055
00:56:10,883 --> 00:56:13,564
It would be nice if we could meet at Place Blanche.

1056
00:56:23,749 --> 00:56:25,324
Well, what about Pierrot?

1057
00:56:25,645 --> 00:56:26,868
I don't know.

1058
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:28,841
Didn't you go down to find him?

1059
00:56:29,038 --> 00:56:30,977
I didn't want to leave you alone.

1060
00:56:31,007 --> 00:56:32,938
I'm not alone. I'm with madame.

1061
00:56:32,998 --> 00:56:34,164
Do as I told you.

1062
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:39,664
Pierrot.

1063
00:56:41,382 --> 00:56:42,838
Where is he?
Who?

1064
00:56:42,838 --> 00:56:44,338
Regis. Where is he?

1065
00:56:45,782 --> 00:56:46,331
Come on.

1066
00:56:47,368 --> 00:56:48,656
They got me, Pepe.

1067
00:56:48,706 --> 00:56:49,564
The police.

1068
00:56:49,779 --> 00:56:51,410
I didn't listen to you.

1069
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:52,343
I'll help you.

1070
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:47,772
No. No.

1071
00:57:47,837 --> 00:57:48,450
No.

1072
00:57:48,969 --> 00:57:49,656
No.

1073
00:57:50,145 --> 00:57:51,005
No.

1074
00:57:51,648 --> 00:57:52,292
No.

1075
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,518
No.

1076
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:55,467
No.

1077
00:57:56,355 --> 00:57:57,055
No.

1078
00:57:57,928 --> 00:57:58,845
No.

1079
00:57:59,344 --> 00:58:00,247
No.

1080
00:58:08,571 --> 00:58:09,660
No.

1081
00:58:11,923 --> 00:58:13,581
Oh, no.

1082
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:26,677
Pierrot?

1083
00:59:28,403 --> 00:59:29,692
There's no sense to it.

1084
00:59:29,945 --> 00:59:31,251
That's what they said.

1085
00:59:31,822 --> 00:59:32,414
They?

1086
00:59:32,995 --> 00:59:33,503
Those people.

1087
00:59:33,812 --> 00:59:34,791
They were frightened.

1088
00:59:35,148 --> 00:59:36,474
Said they'd never come back.

1089
00:59:47,935 --> 00:59:49,684
I was fond of Pierrot.

1090
00:59:49,732 --> 00:59:51,926
I regarded him almost as a son.

1091
00:59:51,968 --> 00:59:53,657
Well, he's closed his umbrella.

1092
00:59:53,716 --> 00:59:55,024
Pepe,

1093
00:59:55,388 --> 00:59:57,739
there's no use in thinking about Pierrot.

1094
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,528
Don't you tell me what to think.

1095
01:00:02,568 --> 01:00:04,164
This a sad thing.

1096
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:05,123
Are you finished?

1097
01:00:05,398 --> 01:00:06,478
I beg your pardon.

1098
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:09,507
You were fond of him. That's enough.

1099
01:00:09,747 --> 01:00:11,160
Can't a man talk?

1100
01:00:41,524 --> 01:00:42,802
Well?
Well.

1101
01:00:43,398 --> 01:00:44,266
It's finished.

1102
01:00:54,291 --> 01:00:56,717
I did everything you would have done, Pepe.

1103
01:00:57,781 --> 01:00:59,901
I was all alone at the cemetery.

1104
01:00:59,955 --> 01:01:02,148
I followed the custom of your people.

1105
01:01:02,354 --> 01:01:04,481
A handful of earth on the body.

1106
01:01:04,963 --> 01:01:05,978
And flowers

1107
01:01:06,283 --> 01:01:09,357
to make him feel at home in such a strange place.

1108
01:01:13,854 --> 01:01:18,892
It's hard not to be able to go sown to say
goodbye to your friend on his last journey.

1109
01:01:55,118 --> 01:01:56,518
I'm your friend, Pepe.

1110
01:01:56,972 --> 01:02:00,580
I lnow how you feel; you'er a prisoner in the Casbah.

1111
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:04,413
But the day will come when they won't be able to prevent your leaving.

1112
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,272
You'll go out of the Casbah in spite of them all.

1113
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:12,534
I'll get out whenever I wish.
When you go, you'll go quietly the way Pierrot went.

1114
01:02:12,591 --> 01:02:13,650
Feet first.

1115
01:02:14,059 --> 01:02:15,184
Be patient.

1116
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:20,088
When the time comes, they'll take off their hats and let you pass.

1117
01:02:20,128 --> 01:02:21,451
I'll go out alive.

1118
01:02:24,706 --> 01:02:26,733
I don't think you're as foolish as that.

1119
01:02:33,279 --> 01:02:34,256
Grandperre,

1120
01:02:34,514 --> 01:02:35,708
I've heard enough.

1121
01:02:39,776 --> 01:02:42,293
Music. Singing. Gibberish.

1122
01:02:42,293 --> 01:02:43,704
I'm sorry for you.

1123
01:02:45,055 --> 01:02:45,908
How is she?

1124
01:02:45,965 --> 01:02:46,617
She?

1125
01:02:46,656 --> 01:02:47,483
You know.

1126
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:50,995
I'm afraid you won't see her again. The last visit was a little too much for her.

1127
01:02:51,034 --> 01:02:53,185
She got a bad impression of the Casbah.

1128
01:02:53,474 --> 01:02:54,191
It's a pity.

1129
01:02:54,802 --> 01:02:58,647
Why should it be a pity?
For your sake since it seems to mean so much to you.

1130
01:02:58,705 --> 01:02:59,535
To me?

1131
01:03:00,196 --> 01:03:02,915
So that's what you're so sorry about.

1132
01:03:02,955 --> 01:03:05,927
Why are you standing there staring at me?

1133
01:03:05,947 --> 01:03:07,133
Do as I tell you.

1134
01:03:07,176 --> 01:03:08,494
Go down.

1135
01:03:09,627 --> 01:03:10,532
And you too.

1136
01:03:10,581 --> 01:03:11,807
Get out.

1137
01:03:12,438 --> 01:03:13,366
I've had enough.

1138
01:03:14,148 --> 01:03:15,074
And you.

1139
01:03:15,533 --> 01:03:17,407
I'm sick of looking at you.

1140
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:22,351
You seem to be sick of everything.

1141
01:03:22,881 --> 01:03:23,468
Right.

1142
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:27,310
I'd bring her up to see you again if it were possible, but there's no chance.

1143
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:28,419
So.

1144
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:29,967
She's not coming back.

1145
01:03:30,018 --> 01:03:31,394
That's fine.

1146
01:03:31,394 --> 01:03:35,086
What?
All that swell jewelry, you had it right in the palm of your hand.

1147
01:03:35,086 --> 01:03:35,835
That's enough.

1148
01:03:36,045 --> 01:03:38,921
These people who look as if they can tear down everything

1149
01:03:38,977 --> 01:03:41,759
and when a woman looks at them, they get as soft as butter.

1150
01:03:41,804 --> 01:03:44,453
Get out.
Well, I'm not made of butter. Not me.

1151
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:45,966
Get out.
Ok.

1152
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:49,366
Your friends have no tact, my dear Pepe.

1153
01:03:49,398 --> 01:03:51,650
They have no respect for the beauty of your anguish.

1154
01:03:51,763 --> 01:03:55,469
I know how it pains you to live among this cattle.

1155
01:03:55,469 --> 01:03:57,973
Let me assure you.
They can't keep me here.

1156
01:03:58,401 --> 01:03:59,462
I'm free.

1157
01:03:59,848 --> 01:04:00,705
Free to go.

1158
01:04:01,193 --> 01:04:02,072
I'm sick of it.

1159
01:04:02,816 --> 01:04:03,761
All of you.

1160
01:04:04,104 --> 01:04:05,912
I'm sick of listening to you.

1161
01:04:06,402 --> 01:04:07,744
And I'm sick of looking at you.

1162
01:04:08,183 --> 01:04:10,171
I'll get out when I feel like it.

1163
01:04:10,241 --> 01:04:11,715
None of you can stop me.

1164
01:04:11,772 --> 01:04:14,163
Listen to me, Pepe.
I don't need your advice.

1165
01:04:14,428 --> 01:04:15,460
None of you.

1166
01:04:15,659 --> 01:04:16,882
I'm free to do as I please.

1167
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:18,462
Free. You hear that?

1168
01:04:18,498 --> 01:04:19,823
You're walking into a trap.

1169
01:04:19,823 --> 01:04:23,416
You know better.
They can't touch me. I'm going down. Get out of the way.

1170
01:04:23,416 --> 01:04:27,272
Let me. And when I please is now. Get out of my way.

1171
01:04:36,012 --> 01:04:38,122
He's gone mad. He's going down to the town.

1172
01:04:38,122 --> 01:04:39,190
He won't listen.

1173
01:04:59,360 --> 01:04:59,968
Hello.

1174
01:05:05,808 --> 01:05:06,583
Good.

1175
01:05:06,644 --> 01:05:07,848
I'll attend to it.

1176
01:05:07,922 --> 01:05:09,871
Inspector Slimane.

1177
01:05:09,927 --> 01:05:11,885
He says Pepe le Moko is coming out.

1178
01:05:30,587 --> 01:05:31,390
Pepe.

1179
01:05:31,442 --> 01:05:32,531
Pepe, don't go.

1180
01:05:32,586 --> 01:05:33,635
You're mad.

1181
01:05:39,586 --> 01:05:41,316
Pepe, don't go. Please don't go.

1182
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,014
I didn't want to tell you this, but she's up there now

1183
01:05:44,875 --> 01:05:46,838
at your old house waiting for you.

1184
01:06:02,922 --> 01:06:03,831
Where is she?

1185
01:06:07,737 --> 01:06:08,790
Where is she?

1186
01:06:09,415 --> 01:06:10,951
You lied to me, didn't you?

1187
01:06:10,997 --> 01:06:12,632
Answer me. Didn't you?

1188
01:06:13,966 --> 01:06:16,804
It was the only way I could keep you from going.

1189
01:06:17,467 --> 01:06:19,613
If I had asked you not to go for me,

1190
01:06:20,136 --> 01:06:21,429
you wouldn't have listened to me.

1191
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:23,359
So.

1192
01:06:30,648 --> 01:06:33,683
You ought to be fed up with a fellow like me.

1193
01:06:37,348 --> 01:06:39,994
I didn't know I could make such a fool of myself.

1194
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:47,605
Ines, have something better than this.

1195
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:50,052
It's not what you deserve.

1196
01:06:51,916 --> 01:06:53,270
It's what you want.

1197
01:06:54,614 --> 01:06:55,987
Why do you worry about me?

1198
01:06:56,531 --> 01:06:57,456
It's not good.

1199
01:06:57,927 --> 01:06:58,795
I have a sharp

1200
01:06:58,830 --> 01:07:00,785
that brings me luck.

1201
01:07:03,014 --> 01:07:05,433
You brought us both luck this time.

1202
01:07:05,439 --> 01:07:07,629
All the while I went running,

1203
01:07:07,851 --> 01:07:09,481
I kept my hand so.

1204
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:11,530
But you caught me.

1205
01:07:12,085 --> 01:07:14,321
I didn't know you could run so fast.

1206
01:07:14,844 --> 01:07:16,569
Don't forget; I've had practice.

1207
01:07:16,797 --> 01:07:18,824
But nobody ever caught me before.

1208
01:07:20,617 --> 01:07:22,548
Next time, give me a head start.

1209
01:07:23,856 --> 01:07:25,220
Next time?

1210
01:07:27,246 --> 01:07:28,291
Don't worry.

1211
01:07:28,647 --> 01:07:30,377
Not 'til I catch my breath.

1212
01:07:32,932 --> 01:07:34,576
I'm thirsty.

1213
01:07:34,576 --> 01:07:35,520
I'll get it.

1214
01:07:37,964 --> 01:07:38,976
No you won't.

1215
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:24,164
Here I am.

1216
01:08:24,604 --> 01:08:26,045
I said I'd be here.

1217
01:08:26,702 --> 01:08:27,592
Well?

1218
01:08:27,872 --> 01:08:29,760
You look as though you've seen a ghost.

1219
01:09:39,389 --> 01:09:40,656
You're beautiful.

1220
01:09:41,362 --> 01:09:42,736
That's easy to say.

1221
01:09:42,754 --> 01:09:44,798
I know a lot of people have told you.

1222
01:09:45,309 --> 01:09:47,234
But what I'm telling you is different. See?

1223
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:49,882
For me, you're more than that.

1224
01:09:50,172 --> 01:09:51,789
For two years, I've been lost.

1225
01:09:52,161 --> 01:09:53,816
Like walking in my sleep.

1226
01:09:53,816 --> 01:09:55,926
Slowly I wake up. That's you.

1227
01:09:56,625 --> 01:10:00,061
I don't know what I've been doing all that time, waiting for you without knowing it.

1228
01:10:00,823 --> 01:10:02,525
Do you know what you are to me?

1229
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,482
Paris. That's you.

1230
01:10:05,887 --> 01:10:06,523
Paris.

1231
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:08,561
With you, I escape.

1232
01:10:08,619 --> 01:10:09,311
Follow me?

1233
01:10:09,558 --> 01:10:10,753
The whole town

1234
01:10:10,939 --> 01:10:12,775
is spring morning in Paris.

1235
01:10:13,808 --> 01:10:15,305
You're lovely.

1236
01:10:16,083 --> 01:10:17,110
You're marvelous.

1237
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,679
And do you know what you remind me of?

1238
01:10:22,667 --> 01:10:23,732
The subway.

1239
01:10:29,286 --> 01:10:30,779
Close your eyes.

1240
01:10:33,691 --> 01:10:34,839
Listen.

1241
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:37,728
Can you hear it?

1242
01:10:38,687 --> 01:10:40,479
That's my heart beating.

1243
01:10:40,539 --> 01:10:42,820
Dose it go like a subway train?

1244
01:10:43,151 --> 01:10:44,187
Faster.

1245
01:10:45,319 --> 01:10:46,881
You're all silk,

1246
01:10:46,936 --> 01:10:48,788
and you jingle when you walk.

1247
01:10:48,788 --> 01:10:51,431
And with all that shi shi, you make me think of the subway.

1248
01:10:51,431 --> 01:10:52,572
Isn't that funny?

1249
01:10:52,572 --> 01:10:53,894
And potato chips

1250
01:10:53,972 --> 01:10:55,774
and coffee on the boulevard.

1251
01:11:00,431 --> 01:11:02,055
What did you do before?

1252
01:11:02,438 --> 01:11:03,287
Before what?

1253
01:11:04,488 --> 01:11:05,691
Before the jewels.

1254
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:07,726
I wanted them.

1255
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:21,189
It's late.

1256
01:11:21,266 --> 01:11:22,400
I must go.

1257
01:11:25,687 --> 01:11:27,328
Suppose you don't come tomorrow.

1258
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:31,486
Suppose I don't.

1259
01:11:32,245 --> 01:11:34,840
Can't you ever get away from the Casbah?

1260
01:11:35,093 --> 01:11:36,044
Why do you ask?

1261
01:11:36,254 --> 01:11:37,023
Can't you?

1262
01:11:37,078 --> 01:11:37,496
No.

1263
01:11:37,789 --> 01:11:38,992
I'm caught here

1264
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:40,842
like a bear in a hole,

1265
01:11:40,919 --> 01:11:43,257
dogs barking, hunters all around,

1266
01:11:43,298 --> 01:11:44,352
no way out of it.

1267
01:11:45,256 --> 01:11:46,239
Do you like that?

1268
01:11:55,201 --> 01:11:56,755
Maybe it's lucky for you.

1269
01:11:58,038 --> 01:11:59,192
I don't like it.

1270
01:11:59,241 --> 01:12:00,519
And it's not lucky.

1271
01:12:01,258 --> 01:12:02,116
You're right.

1272
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:04,943
If you don't come back, I might do anything.

1273
01:12:05,347 --> 01:12:07,437
I might go down to the hotel to get you.

1274
01:12:08,416 --> 01:12:09,929
Tomorrow, Pepe.

1275
01:12:10,006 --> 01:12:11,048
Tomorrow?

1276
01:12:11,690 --> 01:12:13,211
I never break a promise.

1277
01:12:34,018 --> 01:12:35,183
You smell good.

1278
01:12:37,076 --> 01:12:38,143
The subway?

1279
01:12:38,606 --> 01:12:40,321
Streamlined.

1280
01:13:30,528 --> 01:13:31,210
Hey.

1281
01:13:31,478 --> 01:13:32,298
Anton.

1282
01:13:34,895 --> 01:13:35,625
Tomorrow.

1283
01:13:36,378 --> 01:13:37,303
5 o'clock.

1284
01:13:55,714 --> 01:13:56,663
Did you get them?

1285
01:13:57,268 --> 01:13:57,911
What?

1286
01:13:57,991 --> 01:13:59,333
The hardware.

1287
01:14:00,510 --> 01:14:01,839
What's the matter with you?

1288
01:14:01,924 --> 01:14:04,790
If you didn't get the jewels, you're simply wasting your time.

1289
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:06,305
What were you doing in there?

1290
01:14:06,448 --> 01:14:07,913
Where?
There.

1291
01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:09,745
You're mistaken.

1292
01:14:10,317 --> 01:14:11,499
We were not there.

1293
01:14:12,252 --> 01:14:13,405
Say that again.

1294
01:14:15,307 --> 01:14:16,651
We were in Paris.

1295
01:14:16,770 --> 01:14:17,574
What?

1296
01:14:20,012 --> 01:14:21,279
Okay.

1297
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,400
Life is simple if you try to enjoy before you die every bit of happiness along the way.

1298
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:51,200
Take the joy that comes to you.

1299
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,500
Suddenly the world is too with the song that keeps you dancing every day.

1300
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,700
That's the life.

1301
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:58,200
Fall in love and life is sunny.

1302
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:00,900
That's the life you don't need money

1303
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:04,100
if you've got a little honey in your arms.

1304
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:06,300
That's the life.

1305
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:08,900
I'm in heaven and I know it.

1306
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:11,500
Can I help it if I show it?

1307
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,872
Life is sweet as can be for me.

1308
01:15:13,872 --> 01:15:17,600
Love is very necessary.

1309
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,200
Fall in love and you'll be happy. That's the life.

1310
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:23,300
You don't know just what you miss if you live without a kiss

1311
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:26,000
for a kiss can bring your winter into spring.

1312
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Everybody will agree. If you fall in love like me, you'll be happy, you will laugh, and you will sing.

1313
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,400
That's the life.

1314
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:35,800
That's the life we should be living.

1315
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:40,800
Kiss morning, noon, and evening. That's the life that I'll be living.

1316
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,300
That's the moon. That's the life.

1317
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:46,800
There is nothing like that feeling.

1318
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,400
Tell me what is more appealing

1319
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,200
than the feeling you're in love

1320
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:52,800
for sure.

1321
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:57,900
Love is very necessary. Fall in love and you'll be happy. That's the life.

1322
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,100
Love is very necessary.

1323
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:03,911
Fall in love and you'll be happy. That's the life.

1324
01:16:03,911 --> 01:16:05,599
Pepe, what's happened?

1325
01:16:05,652 --> 01:16:06,618
Don't you know?

1326
01:16:06,618 --> 01:16:07,805
It's a holiday.

1327
01:16:07,861 --> 01:16:09,356
No, I didn't know what day it is.

1328
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:11,616
It's Sunday. Everyone gets a holiday.

1329
01:16:11,616 --> 01:16:12,977
But it's not Sunday.

1330
01:16:13,002 --> 01:16:14,580
If I say so, it's Sunday.

1331
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:18,617
It's Thursday.
That's the trouble with you; you always think it's Thursday.

1332
01:16:18,617 --> 01:16:21,594
I didn't think so yesterday.

1333
01:16:21,646 --> 01:16:23,937
Just as a favor to me, let it be Sunday.

1334
01:16:23,988 --> 01:16:26,093
I want to stroll on the boulevard.

1335
01:16:28,499 --> 01:16:30,373
I have a date at the Place Blanche.

1336
01:16:38,598 --> 01:16:39,936
Hello, everybody.

1337
01:16:40,498 --> 01:16:41,715
How do you like my singing?

1338
01:16:41,786 --> 01:16:43,080
What's the good of it?

1339
01:16:44,189 --> 01:16:46,711
You ought to appreciate the finer things of life.

1340
01:16:46,711 --> 01:16:48,064
Who? Him?

1341
01:16:49,254 --> 01:16:51,354
When you feel like that, sing.

1342
01:16:51,354 --> 01:16:52,628
It quiets the nerves.

1343
01:16:53,857 --> 01:16:56,727
You seem pleased. You've seen her again.

1344
01:16:56,774 --> 01:16:57,777
Wouldn't you like to know.

1345
01:16:57,777 --> 01:16:59,816
Oh, well. If you don't want to confide in me.

1346
01:16:59,816 --> 01:17:02,281
Well, our inspector got himself a haircut.

1347
01:17:02,293 --> 01:17:03,371
Did she come back?

1348
01:17:03,371 --> 01:17:04,628
A regular Romeo.

1349
01:17:04,628 --> 01:17:05,968
You ought to get a permanent wave.

1350
01:17:06,048 --> 01:17:07,673
You're expecting her again today?

1351
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:10,742
The trouble with you, Inspector, is that you do too much inspecting.

1352
01:17:10,742 --> 01:17:11,301
Now,

1353
01:17:11,462 --> 01:17:13,252
not a word about what I have told you.

1354
01:17:13,431 --> 01:17:14,893
Just between ourselves,

1355
01:17:15,687 --> 01:17:16,353
yup.

1356
01:17:45,837 --> 01:17:47,001
Inspector.

1357
01:17:47,081 --> 01:17:48,351
Good afternoon.

1358
01:17:48,850 --> 01:17:50,823
I was puzzled when you phoned.

1359
01:17:51,085 --> 01:17:53,887
My mission is a rather delicate one

1360
01:17:53,937 --> 01:17:55,676
but necessary.

1361
01:17:56,599 --> 01:17:58,318
I merely wish to suggest that

1362
01:17:58,393 --> 01:18:01,540
your fiance is a little too fond of

1363
01:18:02,515 --> 01:18:06,123
shall we say, the local color of the Casbah.

1364
01:18:07,556 --> 01:18:08,721
What is all this?

1365
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,385
The Casbah is hardly the place for a woman alone.

1366
01:18:12,428 --> 01:18:14,264
She attracts too much attention,

1367
01:18:14,326 --> 01:18:16,291
excites too much desire.

1368
01:18:17,069 --> 01:18:20,538
If we, naturally, wish to protect her from any embarrassment.

1369
01:18:21,776 --> 01:18:25,164
Further embarrassment can very easily be avoided.

1370
01:18:25,628 --> 01:18:28,468
She must not return to the Casbah.

1371
01:18:35,558 --> 01:18:36,297
Come in.

1372
01:18:39,499 --> 01:18:40,693
Sorry to disturb you.

1373
01:18:43,297 --> 01:18:44,338
You're going out?

1374
01:18:44,421 --> 01:18:45,310
Looks that way.

1375
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:46,257
Where are you going?

1376
01:18:46,458 --> 01:18:47,252
A walk.

1377
01:18:47,495 --> 01:18:48,439
But where?

1378
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,180
In the Champs-Élysées.

1379
01:18:50,234 --> 01:18:52,470
May I ask you to give me a sensible answer?

1380
01:18:52,521 --> 01:18:55,563
Then ask me a sensible question. Where could I go?

1381
01:18:55,986 --> 01:18:57,908
I don't know anyone in Algiers.

1382
01:18:58,584 --> 01:19:00,120
I just walk straight ahead.

1383
01:19:00,165 --> 01:19:01,322
Straight ahead?

1384
01:19:01,568 --> 01:19:03,102
And where does that take you?

1385
01:19:03,102 --> 01:19:04,717
I'll know when I get there.

1386
01:19:04,717 --> 01:19:05,390
No you won't

1387
01:19:05,948 --> 01:19:06,814
because you're not going.

1388
01:19:06,963 --> 01:19:08,372
Oh, yes, my dear.

1389
01:19:08,602 --> 01:19:10,094
Your hotel bores me.

1390
01:19:10,148 --> 01:19:12,139
The head waiter looks like an undertaker.

1391
01:19:12,410 --> 01:19:14,851
An every time I step into this apartment

1392
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:16,952
it looks more like a funeral parlor.

1393
01:19:17,005 --> 01:19:18,221
Goodbye, darling.

1394
01:19:20,445 --> 01:19:21,650
I know where you're going.

1395
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:23,541
Ah?
You're going to the Casbah.

1396
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:25,521
So?
You go there every day.

1397
01:19:25,576 --> 01:19:27,555
Do I?
To meet Pepe le Moko.

1398
01:19:30,097 --> 01:19:32,029
So now you're spying on me?

1399
01:19:33,937 --> 01:19:35,148
You're going to be my wife.

1400
01:19:35,398 --> 01:19:37,162
You don't make it a very pleasant prospect.

1401
01:19:37,162 --> 01:19:39,158
And I won't allow you to behave like this.

1402
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:40,718
I'm glad you told me.

1403
01:19:40,782 --> 01:19:41,778
What do you mean?

1404
01:19:43,761 --> 01:19:44,933
We've got to be honest.

1405
01:19:45,528 --> 01:19:47,084
Why do you think I'm marrying you?

1406
01:19:47,496 --> 01:19:49,411
Look at yourself, and now look at me.

1407
01:19:49,463 --> 01:19:50,834
I've never lied to you.

1408
01:19:51,091 --> 01:19:55,062
You knew I didn't love you when I promised to marry you, and you though it was alright.

1409
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:57,548
Until we are married, I'll do as I please.

1410
01:19:57,616 --> 01:19:58,828
That's fair enough.

1411
01:19:59,342 --> 01:20:00,829
I forbid you to go.

1412
01:20:01,342 --> 01:20:02,346
It's a waste of time.

1413
01:20:02,694 --> 01:20:05,316
If you go now, there'll be no use in you coming back.

1414
01:20:06,145 --> 01:20:08,649
You've thought it all out pretty clearly. Haven't you?

1415
01:20:08,712 --> 01:20:10,846
And I advise you to do the same.

1416
01:20:11,387 --> 01:20:12,199
Alright.

1417
01:20:12,601 --> 01:20:13,280
Goodbye.

1418
01:20:14,444 --> 01:20:15,946
Do it, Gaby. Don't.

1419
01:20:20,324 --> 01:20:21,123
No.

1420
01:20:21,708 --> 01:20:22,270
What?

1421
01:20:22,336 --> 01:20:24,017
You can't go to the Casbah.

1422
01:20:24,074 --> 01:20:24,858
But really.

1423
01:20:24,935 --> 01:20:26,992
Your fiance was trying to spare you.

1424
01:20:27,143 --> 01:20:29,176
He didn't want to tell you the truth as I told it to him.

1425
01:20:29,794 --> 01:20:33,456
An attempt was made to capture Pepe le Moko this afternoon.

1426
01:20:33,456 --> 01:20:35,326
The attempt was successful.

1427
01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:36,321
He was taken?

1428
01:20:36,432 --> 01:20:37,382
Not alive.

1429
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:38,805
He was killed.

1430
01:21:26,656 --> 01:21:29,630
I just came to tell you, it's Thursday.

1431
01:21:30,671 --> 01:21:31,533
I know.

1432
01:21:32,549 --> 01:21:34,485
I was right all the time.

1433
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:36,738
You see, I'm not just a fool as you think.

1434
01:21:38,745 --> 01:21:40,794
So this is the Place Blanche.

1435
01:21:42,779 --> 01:21:44,931
It's not much fun on Thursday, is it?

1436
01:21:45,023 --> 01:21:47,133
It doesn't seem like Paris.

1437
01:22:01,055 --> 01:22:02,476
What's got into him?

1438
01:22:03,378 --> 01:22:05,772
Weren't you ever disappointed in love?

1439
01:22:05,832 --> 01:22:07,097
Yes. Badly.

1440
01:22:08,082 --> 01:22:10,287
I'll try to please you.

1441
01:22:10,954 --> 01:22:12,508
I'm like Pepe.

1442
01:22:12,952 --> 01:22:14,433
I like 'em with diamonds.

1443
01:22:14,966 --> 01:22:16,370
Now he's missed his chance.

1444
01:22:17,452 --> 01:22:22,612
So I guess I'll have to go downtown and give my personal attention to madam's hardware.

1445
01:22:24,019 --> 01:22:25,192
What steamer?

1446
01:22:25,945 --> 01:22:28,498
The Ville d'Algers? Ten o'clock? Good.

1447
01:22:28,556 --> 01:22:29,717
Make the reservation.

1448
01:22:30,925 --> 01:22:31,889
Are you leaving?

1449
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:35,154
I suppose you won't stay for the funeral.

1450
01:22:38,415 --> 01:22:40,114
Four. First class.

1451
01:22:40,607 --> 01:22:42,485
Oh. Send up some whiskey and soda.

1452
01:22:44,933 --> 01:22:45,857
You'll have a drink.

1453
01:22:46,679 --> 01:22:47,779
Just a short one.

1454
01:22:48,314 --> 01:22:49,450
Make you feel better.

1455
01:23:01,692 --> 01:23:02,715
Anything wrong?

1456
01:23:04,007 --> 01:23:05,111
Why don't you sing?

1457
01:23:05,389 --> 01:23:06,765
Why don't you mind your own business?

1458
01:23:07,132 --> 01:23:08,036
I am.

1459
01:23:08,255 --> 01:23:10,538
Only I just though you might be interested.

1460
01:23:10,863 --> 01:23:12,383
I'm going downtown.

1461
01:23:12,783 --> 01:23:13,610
What for?

1462
01:23:13,693 --> 01:23:15,034
Unlike you, I'm bored.

1463
01:23:15,516 --> 01:23:16,914
Anything in your mind?

1464
01:23:16,955 --> 01:23:18,962
Just to look things over.

1465
01:23:19,342 --> 01:23:22,299
-When are you going?
-Now. No use to see a lawyer about it.

1466
01:23:22,391 --> 01:23:24,273
-Do me a favor.
-Sure.

1467
01:23:24,403 --> 01:23:25,791
I want you to deliver a letter.

1468
01:23:25,948 --> 01:23:27,684
I'd take anything that isn't loaded.

1469
01:23:29,052 --> 01:23:31,451
Ok. I get the idea.

1470
01:23:31,528 --> 01:23:33,628
Maybe I don't look like Cupid, but I'll manage.

1471
01:23:34,838 --> 01:23:35,898
Pen and paper.

1472
01:23:36,407 --> 01:23:38,497
Go to the servants' entrance.

1473
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:39,895
Give someone a good tip.

1474
01:23:40,044 --> 01:23:41,834
And tell them you've got to have an answer.

1475
01:23:41,883 --> 01:23:44,862
Don't worry. I won't come back empty handed.

1476
01:23:45,812 --> 01:23:47,323
I'll wait for you at your house.

1477
01:23:47,382 --> 01:23:49,672
I'll be back in two hours. Tell Tania.

1478
01:23:49,951 --> 01:23:50,672
Good luck.

1479
01:23:58,897 --> 01:24:00,078
What time is it?

1480
01:24:00,944 --> 01:24:02,127
9 o'clock.

1481
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:03,913
Is that all?

1482
01:24:04,208 --> 01:24:05,359
In the morning.

1483
01:24:05,873 --> 01:24:07,479
Sun is out.

1484
01:24:07,885 --> 01:24:09,416
I slept all that time?

1485
01:24:11,231 --> 01:24:12,104
Carlos?

1486
01:24:12,341 --> 01:24:13,586
He hasn't come back.

1487
01:24:14,134 --> 01:24:15,326
He hasn't come back?

1488
01:24:15,853 --> 01:24:17,438
I sat up all night.

1489
01:24:19,392 --> 01:24:22,470
I'd like to see him back with what I've got to tell him.

1490
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,508
This time, I'll make him listen to me.

1491
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,216
Poor Carlos.

1492
01:24:28,342 --> 01:24:32,317
Same old story.

1493
01:24:32,788 --> 01:24:33,745
Well.

1494
01:24:33,991 --> 01:24:35,241
Life is like that.

1495
01:24:35,241 --> 01:24:35,885
Yeah.

1496
01:24:36,128 --> 01:24:39,654
And we're dumb enough to hang on because we don't want to stir it when.

1497
01:24:41,686 --> 01:24:42,438
Smart.

1498
01:24:44,147 --> 01:24:45,400
Is Pepe here?

1499
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:46,403
What do you want?

1500
01:24:46,686 --> 01:24:49,790
We've been looking for you everywhere. Why weren't you at home?

1501
01:24:50,054 --> 01:24:51,172
Because I'm here.

1502
01:24:51,231 --> 01:24:52,529
What do you want, L'Arbi?

1503
01:24:53,943 --> 01:24:55,342
I must speak to you alone.

1504
01:24:55,439 --> 01:24:56,446
What's the matter with us?

1505
01:24:56,528 --> 01:24:57,749
Ever got small pox?

1506
01:24:57,816 --> 01:25:00,338
-It's alright; you can talk.
-Pepe, I'm ashamed of myself.

1507
01:25:00,421 --> 01:25:01,544
What's new about that?

1508
01:25:01,623 --> 01:25:03,922
-Oh, It's more than you think.
-I doubt that.

1509
01:25:03,979 --> 01:25:05,654
Go ahead and insult me.

1510
01:25:05,813 --> 01:25:06,864
I deserve it.

1511
01:25:06,864 --> 01:25:08,022
You flatter yourself.

1512
01:25:08,107 --> 01:25:10,489
It's about the letter from Pierrot's mother.

1513
01:25:10,562 --> 01:25:13,781
I brought it and gave it to Aicha, but I didn't know it was from the police.

1514
01:25:13,871 --> 01:25:17,140
If I had known the letter was written by Regis, I wouldn't have done it. Never.

1515
01:25:17,197 --> 01:25:17,972
Go on.

1516
01:25:18,959 --> 01:25:20,833
It was really a woman who gave me the letter.

1517
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:24,760
I, if I had known the truth, I wouldn't have touched it.

1518
01:25:24,842 --> 01:25:26,078
I'm an informer.

1519
01:25:26,152 --> 01:25:28,288
Yes, but I wouldn't have done a thing like that.

1520
01:25:28,370 --> 01:25:30,311
Oh, you're only half an informer.

1521
01:25:30,311 --> 01:25:31,671
The other half is alright.

1522
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:33,469
Oh, that's why I'm here.

1523
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:34,266
For what?

1524
01:25:34,907 --> 01:25:38,838
I couldn't stand it any longer. Forgive me, Pepe.

1525
01:25:38,838 --> 01:25:41,475
Alright. Stop grovelling; it makes me sick.

1526
01:25:41,537 --> 01:25:43,276
I want you to have a good opinion of me.

1527
01:25:43,383 --> 01:25:44,133
So?

1528
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:46,379
I want you to believe me.

1529
01:25:46,446 --> 01:25:47,575
That's why I'm here,

1530
01:25:47,862 --> 01:25:48,852
to tell you

1531
01:25:48,917 --> 01:25:50,872
they got Carlos.

1532
01:25:50,953 --> 01:25:52,223
What about Carlos?

1533
01:25:52,670 --> 01:25:54,188
The police took him.

1534
01:25:54,249 --> 01:25:58,352
-How much did you sell him for?
-I wouldn't be here if I'd sold him.

1535
01:25:58,908 --> 01:26:00,685
First Pierrot, then Carlos.

1536
01:26:00,751 --> 01:26:02,948
Bad luck always runs in threes.

1537
01:26:03,067 --> 01:26:04,567
Your turn will be next, Pepe.

1538
01:26:04,625 --> 01:26:05,996
Don't be so sure.

1539
01:26:06,290 --> 01:26:07,398
So they arrested him.

1540
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:08,471
Who did it?

1541
01:26:08,535 --> 01:26:09,646
Inspector Louvain.

1542
01:26:09,756 --> 01:26:11,880
They were about a dozen of them surrounding him.

1543
01:26:12,350 --> 01:26:13,834
Was there any shooting?

1544
01:26:13,930 --> 01:26:16,748
No, no. They managed very quietly in a nice way.

1545
01:26:17,022 --> 01:26:18,429
What did you have to do with it?

1546
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,877
I was at the police station when they brought Carlos in.

1547
01:26:20,961 --> 01:26:22,765
I had the chance to see him in his cell.

1548
01:26:22,845 --> 01:26:23,921
They gave me a letter,

1549
01:26:23,992 --> 01:26:25,173
the one you had given him.

1550
01:26:25,262 --> 01:26:26,924
Told me to take it to the hotel.

1551
01:26:26,938 --> 01:26:29,824
Every time there is a letter, he is the one that brings it.

1552
01:26:29,893 --> 01:26:30,803
It looks funny to me.

1553
01:26:30,803 --> 01:26:31,636
Be quiet.

1554
01:26:31,636 --> 01:26:34,351
Oh, I am to be quiet while you write letters to other women?

1555
01:26:34,351 --> 01:26:35,148
Never mind that.

1556
01:26:35,148 --> 01:26:36,301
You never wrote a letter to me.

1557
01:26:36,301 --> 01:26:37,039
Shut up.

1558
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:40,735
So you went to the hotel with the letter.

1559
01:26:40,818 --> 01:26:41,988
I did it for you, Pepe.

1560
01:26:42,534 --> 01:26:43,330
You get it?

1561
01:26:43,367 --> 01:26:43,951
What?

1562
01:26:44,658 --> 01:26:45,577
The answer.

1563
01:26:45,643 --> 01:26:47,068
Oh, she wouldn't write you.

1564
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:48,049
But she couldn't.

1565
01:26:48,125 --> 01:26:49,504
She's being closely watched.

1566
01:26:49,599 --> 01:26:51,002
But she expects you this morning.

1567
01:26:51,209 --> 01:26:52,973
You can go down without any risk.

1568
01:26:53,033 --> 01:26:53,767
Go to her.

1569
01:26:53,835 --> 01:26:55,952
Service entrance in the back of the hotel.

1570
01:26:56,015 --> 01:26:57,507
She'll be watching from her window.

1571
01:26:57,561 --> 01:26:58,640
Is that all?

1572
01:26:58,746 --> 01:27:00,468
She wants to come out, but she couldn't get away.

1573
01:27:00,468 --> 01:27:03,559
-You're not going out, Pepe. You can't.
-I told you to shut up.

1574
01:27:04,686 --> 01:27:05,473
Go on.

1575
01:27:05,758 --> 01:27:07,788
She's waiting for me to bring the answer.

1576
01:27:08,322 --> 01:27:09,662
What shall I tell her?

1577
01:27:10,437 --> 01:27:11,969
She's waiting for it.

1578
01:27:12,039 --> 01:27:12,926
Yes.

1579
01:27:13,504 --> 01:27:15,306
I'll take the answer myself.

1580
01:27:16,002 --> 01:27:17,304
You wait here.

1581
01:27:19,389 --> 01:27:20,258
But Pepe.

1582
01:27:20,362 --> 01:27:21,240
Don't worry.

1583
01:27:21,631 --> 01:27:23,620
My friends will take good care of you

1584
01:27:24,006 --> 01:27:25,100
until I come back.

1585
01:27:27,165 --> 01:27:28,661
But she expects me.

1586
01:27:29,405 --> 01:27:29,824
What?

1587
01:27:31,365 --> 01:27:32,404
Nothing.

1588
01:27:33,718 --> 01:27:34,728
I'll wait.

1589
01:27:35,865 --> 01:27:36,915
Tell me.

1590
01:27:37,088 --> 01:27:38,220
What about Carlos?

1591
01:27:39,118 --> 01:27:40,312
Didn't he say anything else?

1592
01:27:40,807 --> 01:27:41,423
Nothing.

1593
01:27:41,905 --> 01:27:42,966
They search him?

1594
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:43,905
Yes.

1595
01:27:45,114 --> 01:27:46,875
Then they took away the five thousand.

1596
01:27:46,875 --> 01:27:47,608
Yes.

1597
01:27:49,609 --> 01:27:53,052
-You're sure he didn't slip the five thousand to you?
-No.

1598
01:27:53,139 --> 01:27:54,202
You're sure?

1599
01:27:55,415 --> 01:27:56,137
What?

1600
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:59,348
Lovain took the money. I saw him put it in his desk.

1601
01:28:01,681 --> 01:28:04,195
You said Gaby couldn't write because she was watched.

1602
01:28:04,267 --> 01:28:04,838
Yes.

1603
01:28:05,244 --> 01:28:08,992
But in a little while she'll be able to see me.

1604
01:28:09,687 --> 01:28:10,828
That's funny.

1605
01:28:11,393 --> 01:28:12,678
He's going to move away.

1606
01:28:12,765 --> 01:28:13,949
Oh, I see.

1607
01:28:14,454 --> 01:28:16,712
-But why couldn't she write to me?
-He was there.

1608
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,445
But she talked to you.

1609
01:28:18,528 --> 01:28:19,859
Because.

1610
01:28:19,859 --> 01:28:21,377
Because you don't know.

1611
01:28:21,650 --> 01:28:24,428
Now there is another thing that doesn't fit in your story.

1612
01:28:24,667 --> 01:28:28,152
How was Louvain able to take 5000 francs from Carlos

1613
01:28:28,225 --> 01:28:29,901
when Carlos didn't have a hundred?

1614
01:28:29,958 --> 01:28:30,828
I don't know.

1615
01:28:32,845 --> 01:28:35,477
Do you think Carlos is dumb enough to give you my letter?

1616
01:28:35,477 --> 01:28:36,420
All joking aside.

1617
01:28:37,089 --> 01:28:39,608
Do you think me so stupid as to believe he would give it to you?

1618
01:28:39,769 --> 01:28:41,774
-All joking aside.
-I give you my word.

1619
01:28:43,276 --> 01:28:45,577
-And then I will go down to see her.
-Yes.

1620
01:28:45,646 --> 01:28:47,420
A woman who is closely watched,

1621
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:49,229
it's funny the way she can do things.

1622
01:28:49,229 --> 01:28:50,426
Now I've laughed enough!

1623
01:28:50,514 --> 01:28:51,263
Do you hear me?

1624
01:28:51,351 --> 01:28:52,200
You've made a fool of me!

1625
01:28:55,171 --> 01:28:56,408
Carlos was arrested.

1626
01:29:02,031 --> 01:29:03,062
Now tell me what happened.

1627
01:29:04,715 --> 01:29:07,197
Shall I break your neck to refresh your memory?

1628
01:29:07,362 --> 01:29:08,165
No, Pepe.

1629
01:29:09,662 --> 01:29:10,763
Slimane planned it all.

1630
01:29:10,763 --> 01:29:11,258
Yeah?

1631
01:29:11,258 --> 01:29:12,424
He told me to come for you.

1632
01:29:12,424 --> 01:29:14,183
- Go on.
 - He thinks you'll come down.

1633
01:29:14,251 --> 01:29:14,635
- Then?

1634
01:29:14,635 --> 01:29:16,295
The hotel is surrounded, they're waiting.

1635
01:29:16,389 --> 01:29:17,571
Did you see the girl?

1636
01:29:17,715 --> 01:29:18,300
No.

1637
01:29:18,366 --> 01:29:19,774
Why didn't she come up yesterday?

1638
01:29:19,774 --> 01:29:21,315
He told her you'd been killed.

1639
01:29:25,258 --> 01:29:28,152
Slimane planned the whole thing.

1640
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:29,870
Is that all?

1641
01:29:29,870 --> 01:29:30,890
Yes.

1642
01:29:30,890 --> 01:29:32,750
Thanks.

1643
01:29:46,125 --> 01:29:47,763
You can't do it, Pepe.

1644
01:29:47,982 --> 01:29:50,034
You can't leave me. What have I done?

1645
01:29:51,077 --> 01:29:53,265
It has nothing to do with you, Ines.

1646
01:29:53,548 --> 01:29:56,093
You're a good kid, but this can't be helped.

1647
01:29:56,292 --> 01:29:57,530
It's not your fault.

1648
01:29:58,330 --> 01:30:01,057
I won't let you do it. I won't let you. You'll be killed.

1649
01:30:01,136 --> 01:30:02,245
Blame it on the Casbah.

1650
01:30:02,245 --> 01:30:05,564
It's for her. You don't care about anything else, so you're throwing away your life.

1651
01:30:05,583 --> 01:30:06,645
But it's my own life.

1652
01:30:06,645 --> 01:30:10,071
Don't do it, Pepe. Don't go. Listen to me.

1653
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:10,983
Pepe.

1654
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:53,650
Wait.

1655
01:32:47,456 --> 01:32:49,084
We didn't expect you.

1656
01:32:49,157 --> 01:32:50,716
He's not coming here.

1657
01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:52,423
He's gone to the boat.

1658
01:32:52,689 --> 01:32:54,372
You expect me to believe that?

1659
01:32:54,465 --> 01:32:56,385
He is going away with her.

1660
01:32:59,358 --> 01:33:01,222
So you're the one to betray him.

1661
01:33:01,818 --> 01:33:03,267
You couldn't wait to run to me.

1662
01:33:03,911 --> 01:33:08,390
You call it love, but it means you'd kill him before you'd let him go free. That's what you've done.

1663
01:33:08,623 --> 01:33:11,202
Sure as if you'd held a gun in your hands.

1664
01:33:11,690 --> 01:33:13,314
I couldn't let him go.

1665
01:33:13,394 --> 01:33:15,145
I couldn't lose him.

1666
01:33:17,263 --> 01:33:20,330
I thought I'd figured all the moves, but I miscalculated.

1667
01:33:21,557 --> 01:33:22,804
I didn't think of you.

1668
01:33:22,899 --> 01:33:23,888
That's just fine.

1669
01:33:25,829 --> 01:33:28,608
In a few more minutes, it might have been put of our hands.

1670
01:33:30,094 --> 01:33:30,939
Don't go.

1671
01:33:30,941 --> 01:33:32,301
-Give him a chance.
-I did.

1672
01:33:32,301 --> 01:33:34,314
But you knew. You planned it this way.

1673
01:33:34,314 --> 01:33:36,441
So he'd walk into a trap. And he's done it

1674
01:33:36,581 --> 01:33:37,483
with your help.

1675
01:33:37,555 --> 01:33:38,153
Come on.

1676
01:34:38,713 --> 01:34:41,682
You know, the pleasant thing about travelling is going back home.

1677
01:34:41,682 --> 01:34:44,106
It's like going away again.

1678
01:34:44,106 --> 01:34:46,621
Oh I had a good time. Didn't you, Andre?

1679
01:34:47,068 --> 01:34:47,778
Me?

1680
01:34:49,597 --> 01:34:52,757
I never laughed so much in my life.

1681
01:35:06,437 --> 01:35:07,440
You see, Pepe,

1682
01:35:08,093 --> 01:35:10,402
we meet at the appointed time.

1683
01:35:11,579 --> 01:35:12,840
Tell the truth.

1684
01:35:12,936 --> 01:35:14,707
I almost missed the appointment.

1685
01:35:18,757 --> 01:35:19,586
Not here.

1686
01:35:20,308 --> 01:35:20,955
As you wish.

1687
01:35:22,090 --> 01:35:24,392
I can't refuse an old friend.

1688
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:02,104
All aboard who goes on board.

1689
01:36:24,823 --> 01:36:26,678
Let me wait here until it leaves.

1690
01:36:27,897 --> 01:36:29,268
It's not much to ask.

1691
01:36:31,358 --> 01:36:32,568
I can't get away.

1692
01:36:34,828 --> 01:36:36,263
I know I can trust you.

1693
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:32,040
Gaby.

1694
01:37:37,517 --> 01:37:38,985
Gaby.

1695
01:37:40,046 --> 01:37:41,740
Gaby.

1696
01:37:41,979 --> 01:37:43,582
Gaby.

1697
01:37:44,476 --> 01:37:45,552
Gaby.

1698
01:37:53,438 --> 01:37:54,655
Gaby.

1699
01:37:58,679 --> 01:37:59,848
I'm sorry, Pepe.

1700
01:38:00,389 --> 01:38:02,377
He thought you were going to escape.

1701
01:38:04,598 --> 01:38:06,287
And

1702
01:38:06,322 --> 01:38:08,270
so I have,

1703
01:38:09,785 --> 01:38:11,057
my friend.
