1
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:28,244
I have a notion to say to him
you think it was a machine.

2
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:29,582
And the worst...

3
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:34,625
For $30 a week, he expects a Cleopatra,
a mother Hubbard, and a speed record

4
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,759
all rolled into one.

5
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:43,596
Taxi!

6
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,230
Thirty-nine riverdale.

7
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,785
Thank you, ma'am.

8
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,133
Good evening.

9
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,798
Mr. Stanton just asked about you, miss.

10
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,432
Oh, is he up?

11
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:25,934
Practically, miss.

12
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,445
Tally-ho. Nothing like
a good day's sleep, my lad.

13
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:38,651
Beg your pardon, sir?

14
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,781
Hmm? Oh, I was talking to myself.

15
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,237
Oh, good morn...
Uh, good evening, miss brenner.

16
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,076
Good evening.

17
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,081
I hope I didn't spoil your evening.

18
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,335
Oh, no. I enjoy coming here.

19
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,712
It's lovely.

20
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,713
The quiet, I mean.

21
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,044
Oh.

22
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,510
No.

23
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,970
What next?

24
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,013
A letter from Mrs. Henderson hall.

25
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,978
You'll probably remember as Mrs. James.

26
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,108
She wants you to get her another divorce.

27
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,564
On what grounds?

28
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,652
She wishes to marry, um... count pesso.

29
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,363
That's a reason, not grounds.

30
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,947
- Make a appointment.
- Yes, sir.

31
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:30,245
This is practically a duplicate.
It's from Mrs. Mona Cavanaugh.

32
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,179
- Yeah, and what are her grounds?
- The same.

33
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,124
What? They both want to marry count pesso?

34
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,756
Oh, no. Pardon.
Her reason is James o'Dell.

35
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:39,927
Oh.

36
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,803
When will these women realize that reason
has nothing to do with getting a divorce?

37
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,681
- Make an appointment for her.
- Yes, sir.

38
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:50,344
Probably use, uh, mental cruelty.

39
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,722
Check up and see what grounds
we used for her last time.

40
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,189
Yes, sir.

41
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,434
White versus white?

42
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,978
Yes. The case is called
for 10:00 tomorrow.

43
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,818
You've had one postponement.

44
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,448
Well, let's see it.

45
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,162
- Uh, good evening, gaylord.
- Hello, my lads.

46
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,772
Oh, you don't have to pretend
to work hard. We're not clients.

47
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,475
Don't you realize that only
very dull people work this time of day?

48
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,504
Or anytime of day.

49
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,539
I apologize for boring you with this,
but I've just started.

50
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,446
Thank heavens we're here in time
to save you from that old devil work.

51
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,960
Oh, I must do some work tonight.

52
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,550
What do you want us to do,
to sharpen pencils for you?

53
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,010
- Impossible.
- Good evening.

54
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,346
- I hope I'm in the right place.
- Well, I don't know.

55
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,476
It, uh, says it intends to work.

56
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:36,686
What? Ah, gentlemen of the jury,
a lady is in distress.

57
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,193
Good. That's where most of them belong
only I spell it with an "h."

58
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:45,031
Gentlemen, the lady is young,
very lovely to look upon.

59
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,033
Ah, that's different. Very different.

60
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,660
Thank you, gentlemen.

61
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,830
What's her distress?

62
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,704
Her husband will fight her divorce action.

63
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,536
Mm, perhaps he has reasons to.

64
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,200
What difference does that make?

65
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,369
The lady shall have
her current heart's desire

66
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,004
or I shall have to take down my shingle.

67
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,676
Hello?

68
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,589
Hello. Who is this?

69
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,594
This is Mr. Stanton's secretary.

70
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,505
Is Mr. Richards there, young woman?

71
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,014
I beg your pardon?

72
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:14,098
- This is Mrs. Richards.
- Oh. Uh, just a moment, please.

73
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,933
Uh, Mrs. Richards.

74
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,847
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.

75
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,483
I want to speak to my husband
at once, do you hear?

76
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,690
Now don't tell me he's not there
because I know...

77
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:27,028
Oh, I know what she's saying.
By heart I know it. Tell her I'm not here.

78
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:30,042
- Or I'll come rush up there...
- Just a moment. Just a moment, please.

79
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:33,242
- Mr. Richards is not here.
- Oh, I know very well he is there.

80
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:37,580
I'm sorry, madame. Mr. Richards
is not here. I've not seen him.

81
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,210
I insist on speaking to him...

82
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,754
Mrs. Richards says...

83
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:45,463
I know. Don't tell me.
Can you imagine her calling me here?

84
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:50,256
I told her I wasn't coming here.
I told her 20 times I wasn't coming here.

85
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,264
- Have a scene?
- No, a brawl.

86
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,891
Well, you fellas would get married.

87
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,805
Well, it's the normal way to live. Finding
your way out of the house at night.

88
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,473
Everybody should get married once.

89
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:03,109
Mm. Just to find out
how really happy you can be... single.

90
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,692
- I know, so I don't have to prove it.
- You're both wrong.

91
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,346
- Get a wife such as I have.
- You only see yours once a month.

92
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,734
That's the point.
I'm in no danger. You are.

93
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,699
- Oh, I don't think so.
- A single man is always in danger.

94
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,490
A clever woman could get you
most anytime she wants.

95
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,454
They don't always stay married.

96
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:22,166
Once a single man is named
co-respondent or even hinted at,

97
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,877
well, you know what happens.

98
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:30,091
Me? I'm married already
and have a great feeling of security.

99
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:34,133
But Richards here is married,
doesn't seem to have worked out for him.

100
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,053
He has the wrong kind of wife.
She's interested in him.

101
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,520
Oh, and yours isn't?
=not in the least.

102
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,649
Her life is peopled with flowers
and, uh, canary birds.

103
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,650
Beautiful, isn't it?

104
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,654
But are you sure that's all
she's interested in?

105
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:48,824
Certainly.

106
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,195
I'm afraid you're not too sure.

107
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,951
You haven't any firsthand knowledge,
have you?

108
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,739
When I was a little boy,

109
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,125
I pulled the braids
of the coachman's daughter,

110
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,331
and I was severely punished for it.

111
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,163
I still like to play with girls.

112
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,957
Mm. With or without braids.

113
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,875
But I've learned not to play
in my own yard.

114
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:12,342
I might add that
I feel the urge to play seriously.

115
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,051
I'm sailing for Paris next week.

116
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:17,717
- I hope you have a rotten time.
- Thanks. You'd better come along.

117
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,636
It's the only life.

118
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,600
What do you do in New York, uh, hibernate?

119
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,481
I don't get involved.

120
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,188
Or have any fun?

121
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,478
Then, I don't spend much time in New York.

122
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,192
And I haven't a worry in the world.

123
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,856
Huh. Neither have I.

124
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,570
Not yet, anyhow.

125
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,486
- Uh-huh.
- Why "uh-huh"?

126
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,495
Uh-huh, nothing.

127
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,499
Unless she happens to want you,
which she probably doesn't.

128
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,581
But if she did, delicately,

129
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,791
with a tuba accompaniment,

130
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:50,084
tell the whole town that you've broken up
her home and then walked out on her.

131
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,883
That, my innocent, young friend,
is the new sin

132
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,968
and your luck will have run out.

133
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,760
I haven't the remotest idea
what you're talking about.

134
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:03,430
And besides, it isn't all luck.

135
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,438
Modest,

136
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,065
isn't he?

137
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,269
What do you think, miss, uh...

138
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,187
- Brenner.
- Uh, miss brenner.

139
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,652
I'm sure it doesn't make
any difference what I think.

140
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,613
But I would like to know.

141
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:20,281
Well, Mr. Stanton says it isn't all luck
that has kept him single.

142
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,825
I was just wondering
who has the other half of the luck.

143
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,752
May I wait in the library?

144
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,336
Oh, certainly. I'm afraid
I shan't be able to work until later.

145
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,047
- I'll have your dinner served in there.
- Thank you.

146
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,550
Do you suppose she meant anything
by that, hmm?

147
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,935
Yes. Anything.

148
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,102
Good evening, Martin.

149
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,943
There's something about this place
that attracts me.

150
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,823
Yes, I can understand that.

151
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,986
- Can we stop here a moment?
- Certainly, madame.

152
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,826
I'm going to announce you to Mr. Stanton.
Please do.

153
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,457
Why doesn't gaylord keep a maid?

154
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:08,836
- Criticizing your host?
- Why not if the criticism is constructive.

155
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,419
Who was that gal we passed in the hallway?

156
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,129
I imagine she's his secretary.

157
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,918
She has the look anyhow.

158
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:20,720
Comforting to have a plain girl
for a darling secretary, isn't it?

159
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:27,180
You know, I think Richards gets his
office girls from the follies chorus.

160
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,643
Who said that?

161
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,934
Who hasn't said it at one time or another?

162
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,272
Hello, darling. =-hello.

163
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,966
- Hello, sweetie.
- Good evening, beautiful.

164
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,652
- Good evening.
- I hope so.

165
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,236
Ah, hello.

166
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:43,322
Isn't anyone going to say hello
or something to me?

167
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,244
I'm speechless. Lost in admiration.
You never looked so well.

168
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,161
I have a special reason, dear.

169
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,706
- Come along.
- We're coming.

170
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,170
- Do you approve of me, darling?
- Always.

171
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,711
And especially tonight.
What's the occasion?

172
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:02,178
Don't be curious about that.
Just about me.

173
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,594
I'm curious about everything you do.

174
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,846
That was sweet.

175
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,015
- Shall we go in?
- Yes, dear. Oh, gaylord.

176
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,642
Who's the girl we passed in the hall?

177
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,732
Girl? Oh, my secretary.

178
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,612
I hoped she was a maid.

179
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,694
You should keep one, dear.

180
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,154
It would be, uh... nice.

181
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,200
Of course. I never thought of it.

182
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,832
I'll attend to it tomorrow. That's a dear.

183
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,747
Uh, the picture...

184
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,158
It, uh, fell down.

185
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,418
Never mind. I'll attend to it.

186
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:14,708
Thank you.

187
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,300
Oh, I'm not hungry.

188
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,429
You'd better eat.
He may keep you late again.

189
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,261
I suppose.

190
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,857
Uh, the picture. Yes?

191
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,736
It didn't fall. Uh, I knocked it down.

192
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,739
Yes, miss. Your dinner is served.

193
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,899
Well, if we expect to
see any of the first act, let's get going.

194
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,359
Oh, let's be very late.

195
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,319
So that you can tramp on everybody's toes?

196
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:27,531
Don't you love to hear them crunch?
Toes, I mean.

197
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,162
- Oh!
- Come on, come on. Let's go.

198
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,574
- Oh, I have a runner.
- Change?

199
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,617
No, dear. Ahh.

200
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,418
You're a darling. And I'm terribly happy.

201
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,877
That's all that matters.

202
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,213
- Being happy?
- Mm-hmm.

203
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:44,798
I've some news.

204
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,260
My husband is filing suit for divorce.

205
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,970
- Ahh!
- Really?

206
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,557
And you, my angel, are the co-respondent.

207
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,722
Isn't that exciting?

208
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,562
You-you mean your husband
filing suit for divorce?

209
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,567
Yes, but that's just an incident.

210
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:04,822
The important thing now
is you and me, angel.

211
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,869
So I'm an angel.

212
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,255
- Aren't you thrilled?
- Oh, thrilled.

213
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,070
- Congratulations, dear.
- Thanks, darling.

214
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,460
- He actually filed?
- They're drawing up the papers.

215
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,721
- Suppose we get ready.
- Gaylord, you'll have to come now.

216
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,008
Oh, uh, I'll join up later.
But it's a celebration.

217
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:35,223
Let him work, dear. Come along.

218
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,138
Come on, girls. We're very late now.

219
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:44,567
Didn't gaylord look cute
on his knees when you told him?

220
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,106
He's a dear.

221
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:51,278
- It was very neat, grace.
- How do you mean neat?

222
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,289
Oh, come, darling. The way you hooked him.

223
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,120
If he doesn't get off the line.

224
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,205
He's been running around loose too long.

225
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,085
I've heard him boast about it.

226
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,497
I do hope everything
turns out all right, dear.

227
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,463
I got the last three without any trouble,
so don't worry too much.

228
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,804
Perhaps grace wouldn't like
to have you drink so much.

229
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,471
Oh, yes, she would.

230
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,766
She'll make his life a beautiful dream,
until she marries him.

231
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,309
No such thing.

232
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,649
- Let's drink to the fallen angel.
- That isn't me.

233
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,781
But you had the life of one.
Now you've fallen. Or was pushed.

234
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,511
Say, quit kidding. This may be serious.

235
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,368
May be serious?
You quit kidding.

236
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,279
Can you just see grace on the stand

237
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,258
coyly admitting to the world
that she is terribly in love with gaylord.

238
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,289
- Oh, I don't believe it.
- Oh, yes, you do.

239
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:41,863
With just the exact number of tears

240
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,463
explaining how she couldn't resist
the dear boy.

241
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,197
And when the trial is over,
you'll have to marry her.

242
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,927
- Huh?
- To whitewash yourself.

243
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,589
I'll think of you
while I'm away enjoying myself.

244
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:56,305
- There's a way out.
- Mm-hmm. But it's a long way off.

245
00:14:56,479 --> 00:15:00,313
I should say he'd be free as air
in about, um... four years.

246
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,189
Grace never stays married
longer than that.

247
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,610
Of course, uh, there's the alimony.

248
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,398
There's a way out.

249
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,488
- There always is.
- Sure. Shoot yourself.

250
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,503
Get committed to an insane asylum.

251
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,828
I've told you I have the only system...
Married freedom.

252
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,121
- Too bad you didn't follow my advice.
- Ah, let him suffer. It'll do him good.

253
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,044
- Come along, infants.
- Already?

254
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,485
- Well, you guys look pretty good.
- Who's coming in my car?

255
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,670
- I am.
- See you later, gaylord.

256
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,805
- Have you room for all of us?
- Aren't you happy?

257
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,763
Well, how can I be...
Uh, you going to the theater without me?

258
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,300
- Then I'll stay, dear.
- Oh, no. No, ll-l have some work to do.

259
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:41,062
Don't work too hard. And you be at
the circle club right after the theater.

260
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,563
Of course.

261
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,725
- We'll have fun, darling.
- Oh, I know we will.

262
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:46,903
Until 11:00.

263
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,565
- Grace.
- Coming.

264
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,570
Bye-bye, dear. Hmm?

265
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,856
Oh.

266
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,086
Oh.

267
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,502
- Sorry I'm so late.
- Oh, that's quite all right.

268
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,177
- You'll find everything here on the desk.
- Oh, thanks.

269
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,600
Won't take long.

270
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,186
Uh, what does this old fool
want to fight the divorce for?

271
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,646
Man hasn't a chance
with a woman like that.

272
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,686
Who? Mrs. White?

273
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,779
Who else?

274
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,280
Where are my notes?

275
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,783
Is it this?

276
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,413
Oh. Of course.

277
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,269
- Drink it. Do you good.
- No, thanks.

278
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,768
What's the matter?

279
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,434
There's nothing the matter with me

280
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,194
that calls for anything that strong.

281
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,400
Hmm?

282
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,654
Oh.

283
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,251
Expensive?

284
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,722
Uh, the stockings, I mean.

285
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,258
It depends on what sort you buy.

286
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,767
Hmm.

287
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:51,981
Well, I'd better tackle Mrs. White's
marital difficulty.

288
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,522
The case is open and shut.

289
00:17:56,701 --> 00:18:00,489
Uh, notes for the,
uh, direct examination of Mrs. White.

290
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,661
Uh...

291
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,950
How much do I pay you?

292
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,955
- What?
- What salary do I pay you?

293
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,878
Thirty-five dollars a week.

294
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,667
Isn't much, is it?

295
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,212
Five dollars more than the last place.

296
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,257
Well, isn't it difficult
to, uh, live on that sum?

297
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,302
Difficult perhaps, but I manage.

298
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,514
Hmm.

299
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,440
Uh, do you live at home?

300
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:35,729
No. I share a furnished apartment
with two other girls.

301
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,192
Well, how do you manage
to clothe yourself on your salary?

302
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,948
Many girls do it on less.

303
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,703
Dirty crowded basements,
bargain sales, make things yourself.

304
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,488
Mm. Presents, I suppose.

305
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:50,000
My aunt Alice sent me
a nightgown Christmas two years ago.

306
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,508
Do you intend to get married?

307
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,722
I have no very definite ideas about it.

308
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,224
Well, the men who take you out...

309
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,931
You do have some friends?

310
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:12,273
I work very hard all day. Often at night.

311
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:16,686
My opportunities for meeting nice men
are very limited.

312
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,651
Sometimes, I doubt there are any.

313
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:24,194
And if I were interested in any man
I happen to know at the moment,

314
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:28,115
why... I'd hide that interest.

315
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,374
But your future?

316
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,335
It doesn't include a husband.

317
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,340
Good.

318
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,130
What did you say?

319
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:41,920
I have a proposal to make which may
brighten your future a little... marry me.

320
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,258
What?

321
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,219
I said you could help yourself
by marrying me.

322
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,182
You're asking me to marry you?

323
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,774
Just that. You heard how Sheridan manages.

324
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:02,907
Well, I want some of the freedom
and security that he has.

325
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:06,786
And you'd have more money
than you have now, lots of nice clothes,

326
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,405
and a chance to travel.

327
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,122
Mostly travel.

328
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,127
Why, I thought perhaps
you'd like to travel.

329
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,504
So I would...

330
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,007
With my husband.

331
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:24,011
Oh, but you'd enjoy yourself.
You couldn't help it.

332
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,672
And you'd have all the lovely things...

333
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,217
That I've stood in front of shop windows
and wanted.

334
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,395
Exactly.

335
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,846
Well?

336
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,515
No, I can't do it.

337
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:41,313
A little while ago, I said I had no
definite plans about marriage,

338
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,699
perhaps I should have said
no one wanted to marry me.

339
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,656
Oh, now don't misunderstand me.

340
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,663
But I have an idea
of the sort of marriage I'd like.

341
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,994
I've thought about it often.

342
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,454
Oh, but this wouldn't be a real marriage.

343
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,465
It would be all the marriage I'd have.

344
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,001
And the marriage I've pictured for myself

345
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,719
doesn't start out with my husband
putting on a wedding ring with one hand

346
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:13,182
and handing me a railroad ticket
with the other.

347
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,724
Ah, I've hurt you.

348
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:22,190
Oh, I'm sorry.

349
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:27,358
I just thought that you'd look upon it as
merely... a better job.

350
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,704
I'm in an awful jam.

351
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,742
You would be doing me a great favor.

352
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:39,333
We can hardly take that into account.

353
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,093
It's getting late.
Won't you please finish your dictation?

354
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,424
Oh, I can't work tonight.

355
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,558
I'll have to try
and get another postponement.

356
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,560
Well, then I'll go now.

357
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,937
- Good night.
- Good night.

358
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:02,939
Oh, uh...

359
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,109
Sleep on it.

360
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,320
Perhaps you'll feel differently
in the morning.

361
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,611
I don't see how I can.

362
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,780
Did that guy keep you late again?

363
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,160
Not late.

364
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,945
It's midnight.

365
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,786
Yes, I know, but I've been walking.

366
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,451
Walking since 9:30.

367
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,335
Walking? Alone?

368
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,248
Yes. Trying to think.

369
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,634
Oh, what's the use?

370
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,923
None.

371
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,266
Did a man ever try and seduce you?

372
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:22,481
Good heavens! Sylvia, what happened?

373
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,146
Sylvia, what's happened?

374
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:28,028
Oh, don't get alarmed. Nothing's happened.

375
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,689
Then what are you talking about?

376
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:34,907
Something I had this morning
that I've lost.

377
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,664
My pride. My belief in myself.

378
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,667
I knew I was no beauty, but I...

379
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,583
Wouldn't it be dreadful to be seduced?

380
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:49,501
Well, I've discovered
something infinitely worse.

381
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,839
Finding out that nobody wants to.

382
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:55,381
How did you find out that nobody wants to?

383
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,470
I did. How?

384
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,013
- Stanton asked me to marry him.
- Oh!

385
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,307
He's in a jam.

386
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:08,694
And he took one look at me
and said I could travel... alone.

387
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,820
Well, what's wrong with that?

388
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:16,160
If you ask me like that,
"what's wrong with it?" I don't know.

389
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,203
Hello, there.

390
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,831
Bobbie. Uh, Bobbie.
Stanton wants to marry Sylvia.

391
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,866
- What?
- Yes, it's on the level.

392
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,876
It isn't a pipe dream?

393
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,583
What do you think of that?

394
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:29,294
Gee, I'm glad somebody
around here gets a break.

395
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:33,211
Oh, Sylvia, it'll be a thrill
just thinking about you.

396
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,846
Buying clothes,
getting your hair and face fixed

397
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,802
so they look like something

398
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,719
and not worrying over the fact
that it costs half you make.

399
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,228
- But, Bobbie, I...
- Is he nice? Are you in love with him?

400
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:46,141
How'd it happen? Oh, say something.

401
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,070
What's the matter?

402
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:55,278
I used to think he was awfully nice.

403
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,658
He isn't.

404
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,410
No, I'm not in love with him.

405
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,821
And he's even less in love with me.

406
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,582
He just happens to need a wife.

407
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,994
What's the matter?
Is he going to become a father?

408
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:11,165
No. He wants to marry me
to keep from marrying someone else.

409
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,629
Oh, why can't I meet a guy like that?

410
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:17,296
He wants her to travel.
Live outside of New York, I suppose.

411
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,762
- Any strings?
- I don't think so.

412
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:25,600
He's not offering you marriage, deary.
He's offering you heaven.

413
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,037
Oh. Good morning.

414
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,788
Good morning, Mr. Stanton.

415
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,125
- I've been thinking.
- So have I.

416
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,995
Have you seen this?

417
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,130
Yes, I've seen it.

418
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,967
Well, are you going to help me out?

419
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,712
Well...

420
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,473
I can't see why you'd regret it.

421
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,634
Now, come. Sit down.

422
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,812
We'll draw up a sort of a rough contract.

423
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:11,692
Give us a better idea of what we're about.

424
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:13,693
We can do that.

425
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,104
Yes.

426
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,440
Um...

427
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:25,282
The, uh... the marriage of gaylord Stanton
and, uh, Sylvia brenner...

428
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:29,535
Is to stand for one year as per contract.

429
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,669
You see, you're not
tying yourself up for life.

430
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,331
Oh. Our marriage is to be different
from most.

431
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:38,423
Well, anyway, we won't have to
fight our way out of it. That's something.

432
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,133
Indeed it is.

433
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:45,893
Sylvia brenner is to receive
$5,000 a year, paid in advance,

434
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:48,019
and may live wherever she chooses.

435
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:51,557
- Anywhere?
- Why not?

436
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:56,445
Sylvia brenner will go by the name
of Mrs. gaylord Stanton,

437
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,482
and, uh, will in no way blemish that name.

438
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,078
I know. Go ahead and say it.

439
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,831
It looked well in the contract.

440
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,042
Well, what do you say?

441
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,498
Yes?

442
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,421
Anything you want to add?

443
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,208
Well, there's... there's just one thing.

444
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,504
It's rather difficult
to put in words. Well...

445
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,389
But, uh, this won't be a real marriage.

446
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,144
It'll be... well, it's just a pretense.

447
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,644
I know.

448
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:33,558
We... you wouldn't expect, uh...

449
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:37,728
Well, uh, we'll be married in name only.

450
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,693
Oh, not in fact?

451
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:43,735
That's agreeable.

452
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,075
- Why are you laughing?
- Oh, just at the way you put it.

453
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:48,739
Well, then, everything's settled.

454
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,033
Now, let's see, what are my engagements?

455
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,372
I'd like to make it today.
Would that be all right?

456
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:54,286
Yes.

457
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,750
I want to get out of town tomorrow.

458
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:00,088
Oh. I should dine at the laceys' tonight.

459
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:01,968
Well, I can break away early.

460
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:05,427
Uh, suppose I pick you up,
uh, say, 10:30 tonight?

461
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,592
- Anything you say.
- Good.

462
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:12,180
Well, uh, I'll go now. Y-you don't mind?

463
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,938
No, no. Of course not.

464
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,647
Oh, uh, you better call up the agency
and get me another secretary.

465
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,563
- And, uh, stay and show her what to do?
- Mm-hmm.

466
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:24,654
I know a very confident girl
who might like the job.

467
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:25,988
Good.

468
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:32,996
Oh, uh, stop at city hall
and pick up a marriage license.

469
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,580
10:30 tonight.

470
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:49,676
Do you, Sylvia brenner, take
gaylord Stanton to be your lawful husband?

471
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,468
I do.

472
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:56,812
And do you, gaylord Stanton, take
Sylvia brenner to be your lawful wife?

473
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,145
I do.

474
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,112
The ring, please.

475
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:21,336
Vested with authority,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

476
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:25,298
And I wish you a long
and happy married life.

477
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,444
Thank you. Let's go.

478
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,910
I'm sorry.

479
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:02,001
- I didn't mean to cry.
- Oh, that's all right.

480
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:06,335
Well, what are you going to do now?

481
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:09,380
Do? Why?

482
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:13,471
I suggest that you go abroad.
Say, to Paris.

483
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,226
- Paris?
- Mm.

484
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,939
Is, uh, that what you'd like?

485
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,224
Yes.

486
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:25,942
Why... I'd love to go to Paris.

487
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:28,357
I'm sure I'd be very happy there.

488
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,742
I'll arrange your passage
first thing in the morning.

489
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,283
- Don't trouble.
- Oh, it's no trouble at all.

490
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,699
You just call up my club.
They'll attend to it.

491
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,251
Thank you.

492
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,709
Drop me a line sometime.

493
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,756
Oh, uh, that contract.

494
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,091
Of course, it wouldn't mean anything
in a court of law.

495
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,052
It's merely our word of honor.

496
00:30:55,729 --> 00:31:00,598
Don't worry. I won't trouble you. Ever.

497
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:08,731
I hope you'll be very happy. In Paris.

498
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,451
- You looking for a table?
- Yes. Please.

499
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,849
Would you like to dance?

500
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,888
- Why, Mr. durant.
- Well, this is splendid. Really splendid.

501
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,397
- I didn't know you were on the boat.
- Didn"t you?

502
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:10,356
Do you remember where you did see me last?

503
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:14,114
At, um... certainly. Um, at Stanton's.

504
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:17,447
Well, I'm a little surprised
that you do remember.

505
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:20,454
To forget you would be
an unpardonable sin.

506
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,410
- Shall we dance?
- Yes.

507
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:23,744
Pardon me.

508
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:31,131
Steward, find out the name of the lady
I'm dancing with. Quickly.

509
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:32,541
Yes, sir.

510
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,760
Shall we?

511
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,018
- Traveling alone?
- Yes.

512
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:29,227
Alone at last.

513
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,982
It's pretty noisy tonight, isn't it?

514
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,859
- Like to slip away?
- Mm, don't think we should.

515
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:38,364
I do. I've some things to talk over.
You know, legal things.

516
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:39,615
It'll wait.

517
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,742
I don't want them to wait.

518
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,030
- I'm going to get the divorce.
- Well, let's celebrate.

519
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,494
- Are you still happy?
- Yes.

520
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:50,832
I've something to celebrate myself.
My wife...

521
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:54,506
My wife sailed for Europe last night.

522
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,166
Well, isn't that grand.

523
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,460
Yes, I thought you'd be glad to know.

524
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:03,298
- Your what?
- Yes.

525
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,842
She'll be gone for months.
Isn't that swell?

526
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,682
Gaylord, are you joking?

527
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,229
About her sailing? Oh, no.

528
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,062
Not her sailing, her.
How could you have a wife?

529
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,521
Oh, didn't you know?

530
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,561
Where have you been keeping her?

531
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:20,949
Oh, um, she's been in, uh,
sanitariums and things. She's an invalid.

532
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,201
I don't know what to say.

533
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,453
About, uh, wives and husbands
and things like that?

534
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,831
Well, why talk about them?
They're not important.

535
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:28,740
Oh, no.

536
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:33,537
Tonight, there's just you and I and a
barrel of fun that's waiting to be tapped.

537
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,546
And perhaps tomorrow a headache.

538
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,878
Well, there's always a headache tablet.

539
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,726
Another bid for the last bottle?

540
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,808
175.

541
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,935
Do I hear 807?

542
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,974
- 180!
- 190!

543
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,395
Thank you. Another bid?
This is a lucky bottle.

544
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,573
200!

545
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,360
225!

546
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,694
250!

547
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,905
Another bid?

548
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,322
Sold to Mr. durant for 250.

549
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,627
That's a lot of money
for a bottle of champagne.

550
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:20,918
Not when I'm assured
that you will help me drink it.

551
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,389
Thank you, madame.
You are very kind and generous.

552
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:31,887
He should have thanked you.
What fun would that have been for him?

553
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:33,521
Fun? - Yes.

554
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:36,809
When he said "kind and generous,"
he was thinking...

555
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,942
"Isn't she lovely?"

556
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:42,652
And so, the "kind and generous" was said
warmly, as if they were important.

557
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:45,659
- Well, aren't they?
- They should be.

558
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:50,072
But few people know other people
well enough to find out things like that.

559
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,120
You know what I mean?

560
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,285
Indeed I do.

561
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,499
To the lady who has made this
a lovely voyage.

562
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:00,256
May it continue after we disembark.

563
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:04,761
I have no comparison to make,
but I've enjoyed it.

564
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:11,644
Most women wouldn't be content for
the sort of... honeymoon you're having.

565
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:14,646
Why, I didn't mean to say just that.

566
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:19,355
How did you discover I was Mrs. Stanton?

567
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:20,985
I asked the steward.

568
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:24,694
He doesn't know the answers
to the other questions.

569
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:28,326
- Too bad. You've asked me millions.
- I'm sorry.

570
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,827
And very difficult questions.

571
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:32,455
I'm very sorry. I shan't ask you any more.

572
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,002
Look here. Why are you traveling alone?

573
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,047
Is it so unusual?

574
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,634
That's a question, not an answer.

575
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:53,973
Once you intimated that you expected to be
in Europe indefinitely, alone.

576
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,055
Yes, I think it is unusual.

577
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,044
Certainly, if you were my wife,
it couldn't happen,

578
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,729
and Stanton isn't any cripple either.

579
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:03,862
Mm, you wouldn't have a wife.
Not under any conditions.

580
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,524
Think of the precautions you take
to ensure your freedom.

581
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:11,320
Is that your answer to getting married
and taking a boat trip alone?

582
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,994
To give Stanton some sort of protection?

583
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,373
He believes in married freedom.

584
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:22,414
And what does that mean exactly to you?

585
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,548
Another question.

586
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,051
I don't know the answer
to that one myself.

587
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,712
Now you're being mysterious.

588
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,380
I don't mean to be.

589
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:33,391
And, after all,
I am simply a married woman.

590
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,847
So were Helen of Troy and some others.

591
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,773
Why are you going to Paris?
Oh, I didn't mean...

592
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,980
Oh, yes, you did.

593
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,897
I'm going for one thing.
The thing I go for every year.

594
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,736
Adventure.

595
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,775
And with eyes like yours,

596
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:52,910
you must know
there's only one sort of adventure

597
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:56,744
that adds very much to the total
of one's pleasant memories.

598
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:01,878
Well, I hope you find
what you're looking for.

599
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,872
I think I will.

600
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,721
Where do you intend stopping in Paris?

601
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,556
I don't know.

602
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,686
Is there a Martha Washington hotel?

603
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:22,270
No, I'm afraid not.

604
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,776
Let me reserve you rooms at the cléon.

605
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,903
I'm sending a wireless for myself tonight.

606
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,570
- Well...
- Oh, you'd better.

607
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,238
It may be late when we get in.

608
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:35,449
And, if you wish,
you can change the next day.

609
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,783
All right.

610
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,067
Entrer?

611
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:13,994
Oh.

612
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,277
Good evening.

613
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:17,828
Tired?

614
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,034
Perhaps.

615
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,324
But I'm so excited I can't even notice it.

616
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,606
Are you pleased with your rooms?
They look comfortable.

617
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:27,373
Oh, they are comfortable. And beautiful.

618
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,290
They're not for me. Oh, yes.

619
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,506
Oh, no. You see,
I haven't very much money.

620
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,796
But your husband...

621
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,181
I know enough about him
to know that he can afford them.

622
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:38,842
I was his secretary.

623
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,181
It isn't what you were, it's what you are.

624
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:44,598
Well, I'm still more or less
an employee of his.

625
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:48,394
He's increased my salary
but not enough for this.

626
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,653
Are you in love with him?

627
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:51,983
No.

628
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:56,155
- And don't ask me any more questions.
- I'm sorry.

629
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,237
- That's all right.
- You're tired tonight.

630
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,155
Tomorrow, you'll feel very differently.

631
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:04,041
I know, tomorrow,
you'll spend the whole day in shops,

632
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:05,827
beauty parlors and...

633
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,668
Oh, not that you need to.

634
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:13,835
But I know you will. It will give you
a feeling of courage, power.

635
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,671
Power.

636
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,882
Will you dine with me tomorrow?

637
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:21,885
Gladly.

638
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,099
And during the day, what?

639
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,231
You know what.

640
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,448
But they're all so expensive.

641
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,203
Oh, no, madame.

642
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:44,366
Just have them on
when you show your husband the bill.

643
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,952
- All right, I'll take them.
- Oui, madame.

644
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:50,873
The stockings are
very superior quality, madame.

645
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,310
All right,
will you give me six pairs, please?

646
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:55,387
Of course, madame.

647
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:59,468
They make your feet much more interesting.

648
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,758
Not that they aren't, actually.

649
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,221
Of course.

650
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,689
- Oh, I like this one all right.
- Oui, madame.

651
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,908
Madame, we should put a little more here.

652
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,078
- There?
- Oui, madame.

653
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,919
I am doing wonders for you, cheri.

654
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:43,634
Won't your husband be pleased
when he sees you?

655
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,644
My husband is blind.

656
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:51,854
Well... he can feel.

657
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,504
But wherever are we?

658
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,169
In a nice, little villa
that I hope you will like.

659
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:21,804
- Little?
- Mm-hmm.

660
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,510
Monsieur?

661
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,390
Merci.

662
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,301
- Shall we?
- Yes.

663
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,992
Oh, isn't it lovely?

664
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:46,325
I'm glad you like this room.
I hope you like the rest too.

665
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,164
I generally live here when I'm in Paris.

666
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:56,377
But this year I've decided not to.
I've made other plans.

667
00:43:56,551 --> 00:44:00,544
Too bad.
The, uh, memories here will miss you...

668
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,212
Even if you don't miss them.

669
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,723
Oh, I don't mean
that they shall be lonely.

670
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:09,219
Won't you live here while you're in Paris?

671
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:13,686
And, um, become a memory too?

672
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:18,103
But all pleasant memories.
And you can become what you choose.

673
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:27,496
Suppose I should become a...
An unpleasant memory?

674
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,032
You wouldn't. Not if you're happy here.

675
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:45,287
Sometimes, when you're not conscious
of anyone looking at you,

676
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:49,225
there's a look in your eyes
that is... positively sad.

677
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:52,645
I think I know why.

678
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:57,107
But you won't be forever on a honeymoon
that might as well be spent in a nunnery.

679
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:03,778
It hasn't been unhappy, this honeymoon,
as you insist upon calling it.

680
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,283
You could be happier. So much happier.

681
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:09,070
Well, so could most everyone.

682
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:12,540
Oh!

683
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:16,290
I'd love to live in a house like this.

684
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,835
I could do without the memories.

685
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:21,795
But this would be too expensive.

686
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,880
- How do you know?
- Well, wouldn't it?

687
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:26,842
It costs me nothing to let you live here
since I don't want to myself.

688
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:28,506
- Nothing?
- Practically nothing.

689
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,640
I have to keep it up in any event.

690
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:36,643
Is there any other reason
why you shouldn't live here?

691
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,980
There undoubtedly is.

692
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,695
But I can't think of it.

693
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,649
You're bringing me luck.

694
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,528
Won't you play for me?

695
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:07,699
Yes.

696
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:15,263
May I take a picture?

697
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,471
Is, uh, this to be sent home?

698
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:21,888
- Surely. It's for an American magazine.
- Do you mind?

699
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:24,686
No. On the contrary.

700
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,145
One moment.

701
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:50,917
Indeed. Very ill.

702
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:54,132
Am I supposed to wait for her to die?

703
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,266
Let me tell you,
if durant has her under his wing,

704
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:57,848
she's no invalid and you know it.

705
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,225
- Look at that.
- I am looking.

706
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:03,053
She looks very well.

707
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:06,682
Where have I seen her?

708
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,023
What difference does it make?

709
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,687
None.

710
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:15,404
Except, I suppose
she spends her spare time laughing at me.

711
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:18,320
I'd like to hear her just once.

712
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:23,408
Haven't you mooned
over that picture long enough?

713
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:25,702
You know what she looks like.

714
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,245
I wonder.

715
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:31,715
- When are you divorcing her?
- On what grounds?

716
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:36,175
Surely there's no harm in watching
an automobile race, even with durant.

717
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:40,140
That's the only thing
that isn't grounds then.

718
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:46,602
Besides, they don't spend all their time
looking at automobile races.

719
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,676
Very beautiful.

720
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:01,089
You've never been in better voice.

721
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,308
I'm sure you know why.

722
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,594
It takes two to create a love song.

723
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:10,059
You helped tonight.

724
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:15,103
The perfume of your hair,
the warmth of your eyes.

725
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:20,366
But more important still,
the unseen cup that passed between us.

726
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:23,528
I want to drink deeply. I want...

727
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:26,493
You should really write poetry.

728
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:28,373
I could... now.

729
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:30,910
You seem to know all the words.

730
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,294
Perhaps.

731
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:36,958
One can never discover you alone.

732
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:40,344
Could we step out for a moment and talk?

733
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:44,006
- Can"t we talk here?
- Oh, I am not at ease here.

734
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,675
Are you sure I'd be at ease there?

735
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:49,186
Je suis désoleé.

736
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:52,473
Sylvia, dear, before I forget it,

737
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:55,609
won't you come and spend July
with us at biarritz?

738
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:59,363
- Well, I hadn't...
- I'll persuade you.

739
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:03,526
I have a pleasant surprise for you,
I think.

740
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:05,319
Good. Thank you.

741
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:11,496
She just asked me to stay with her in
biarritz. I think she'll invite you too.

742
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,207
She'd better, or I'll cut her heart out.

743
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:18,169
Sylvia, can't we have
a moment alone together tonight?

744
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:22,053
- Why?
- Oh, don't ask me why.

745
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:26,340
Well, I don't suppose anyone would notice
if we stepped out in the garden a moment.

746
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,083
Whatever in the world is the matter?

747
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,585
You see me alone most every day.

748
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,041
I know.

749
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:58,877
Has something happened?

750
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:02,464
Yes. An important something, or I
shouldn't have been so urgent about it.

751
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:06,012
I've thought about it often.

752
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,674
But tonight I heard someone say
something that...

753
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:11,769
Crystallized my ideas on the subject.

754
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,477
Nearly everybody in that house

755
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:19,314
believes that you and I...

756
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:23,401
Well, that we're...
We're having an affair.

757
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:30,405
My dear, and you're afraid
I'll be hurt if I find out?

758
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:33,251
Don't worry.

759
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:36,411
My reputation isn't very important.

760
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,338
I'm sorry, of course.

761
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:44,798
But as long as it's sort of in other
people's minds and not in yours and mine,

762
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:47,304
I shan't be unhappy.

763
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,674
Now you've made it utterly impossible
for me to tell you

764
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:52,139
what I came out here to say.

765
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,428
And I thought I couldn't wait
another minute.

766
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:01,148
You'd better go in.
I'll follow after everyone else has left.

767
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,357
All right.

768
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,331
I thought you'd forgotten me.

769
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:58,663
The others have been gone a long time.

770
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,874
You know I'd not forgotten you.

771
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:05,507
Sylvia.

772
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,045
Yes?

773
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:13,387
You know what I've made up my mind
to do tonight?

774
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,221
Ask you to become my...

775
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,598
What do you suppose
I think about when I leave here

776
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,391
night after night?

777
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:28,023
Oh, I can't pose as one of the rover boys.

778
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,862
I had only one regret
about the thing I heard tonight.

779
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:34,696
I regretted the fact that it wasn't true.

780
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,744
I may as well be truthful,
don't you think?

781
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,501
Yes.

782
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:45,460
I felt so restless lately
and, at times, positively useless.

783
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:48,091
I felt like that sometimes too.

784
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:52,551
Useless to myself and everyone else.

785
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:57,263
I'm sorry. I can't be different than I am.

786
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:00,099
Sylvia...

787
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:02,773
Will you marry me?

788
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,937
I'm in love with you.
I have been for a long time.

789
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:12,233
Things can't go on like this.
Tell me, dear.

790
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:14,242
Tell me, what do I mean to you?

791
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:16,946
Oh.

792
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,907
Oh, what can I say?

793
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,581
You've made me very happy.

794
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:27,168
Happier than I've ever been in my life.

795
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,253
I could make you even happier.

796
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:31,422
Don't doubt me.

797
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:35,215
Oh, it isn't you I doubt. It's myself.

798
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,633
Well, let me worry about that.

799
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,847
That wouldn't be quite fair.

800
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:43,480
Let me be as fine to you
as you've been to me.

801
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,733
Let me think, and you think too.

802
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:50,271
Perhaps if I go,
you'll be very glad you're free.

803
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,155
Oh, Sylvia, don't, please.

804
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:55,159
You forget, my friend, I know you.

805
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:58,321
I've changed, almost as much as you have.

806
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:02,658
Have I changed so very much?

807
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:07,045
Only someone who hasn't seen you since you
left New York could realize how much.

808
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:14,135
Start getting a divorce tomorrow.

809
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:19,638
No. I'll start for New York tomorrow.

810
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,887
There's someone there I must see.

811
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,353
It can't be Stanton.

812
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:31,024
Sylvia, have you...

813
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,526
Have you a lover in New York?

814
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,985
One would hardly call him a lover.

815
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:41,868
Though I was terribly in love with him.

816
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,200
Are you now?

817
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,002
I don't know.

818
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:51,377
I must find out.

819
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:56,045
And the only way is to see him once more.

820
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,111
Well, here we are in New York.

821
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,253
- Annie!
- Sylvial

822
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:19,636
- Sylvia, how are you?
- Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

823
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,548
Well, what's happened to you?
You're gorgeous!

824
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:25,012
That's not a happening, darling,
that's an accomplishment.

825
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:26,768
Tell me, are you glad to see me?

826
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:30,055
Gee, am 1? But ought I to call you Sylvia?

827
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,233
Why not?

828
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,232
Well, you're not quite like her.

829
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:34,939
Don't be too sure.

830
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:37,820
- Tell me, how is, um...
- Oh, him?

831
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,357
Well, he's all right
if you like that type.

832
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,275
Shall I tell him you're here?

833
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:50,959
Sylvia... oh, Mrs...
Mrs. Stanton, she's outside.

834
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,745
Mrs., uh... Stanton. She's back.

835
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,664
Oh, show her in.

836
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:58,633
Go on in.

837
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:05,007
I hope you don't mind
my dropping in on you like this.

838
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:07,301
Mind? I'm tickled to death.

839
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:13,857
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

840
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:30,908
- Well, when did you return?
- This morning.

841
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:33,648
Oh, why didn't you let me know?
I would have come down to meet you.

842
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:35,378
I hardly thought you would.

843
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:38,507
Oh, come now.
I was very busy when you went away.

844
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:43,174
Anyway, it's nice, your coming
to see me the day you arrive.

845
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:47,599
I have some things
I want to see you about.

846
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,555
Good.

847
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,139
I'm thinking of getting married.

848
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:54,306
What? But you are married.

849
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:57,100
Well, at least your year isn't up yet.

850
01:00:57,279 --> 01:00:59,315
Oh, I see. Well...

851
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:03,114
I'll wait until the end of my year.

852
01:01:03,285 --> 01:01:05,492
Oh, I didn't mean just that.

853
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,277
If you want a divorce, certainly.

854
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:10,413
It's just that, well,
I was rather taken by surprise.

855
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:14,042
Surprise?
Surprise that someone's in love with me?

856
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:18,171
Of course not.
It's just that I was sort of counting on...

857
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:22,254
But you're right. Your own happiness
is all that should matter to you.

858
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:24,420
You don't need me
for anything else, do you?

859
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:26,554
I do. Rather badly.

860
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:30,951
Don't tell me you've developed
too much sympathy for another woman

861
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:32,935
whose husband doesn't understand her.

862
01:01:33,982 --> 01:01:35,597
It's the same one.

863
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:39,233
Mrs. Lawrence?
You are being very constant.

864
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,486
And a little ridiculous.

865
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:43,317
She says she's moving in to my apartment.

866
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,072
And you could move out.

867
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:47,450
Well, it would be very inconvenient.

868
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:50,488
And besides, nobody'd really
believe that I moved out.

869
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:54,374
And then there will be a row,
and I'll be in a mess again.

870
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,981
And if I don't get shot,
something worse. I'll have to marry her.

871
01:01:57,005 --> 01:01:58,245
What? Again?

872
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:02,124
Do you really want to get rid of her?

873
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:03,587
I do.

874
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:06,174
Will you help me?

875
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:08,009
I have to, don't I?

876
01:02:08,183 --> 01:02:10,390
No, you don't have to.

877
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:14,144
And I won't let you unless
you say... "L want to."

878
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:15,975
I want to help you.

879
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:20,062
Well, uh...

880
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:21,693
It'll be very simple.

881
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:24,696
You just arrived,
move your things into my apartment,

882
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:28,984
and take your lawful place beside me.

883
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:32,450
Just what do you mean by
my "lawful place" beside you?

884
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:36,458
Well, they'll all be there
for dinner tonight.

885
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:41,372
And you shall be there
as my adored and adoring wife.

886
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:44,040
And then, after they've gone...

887
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:46,005
I can return to my hotel.

888
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:49,838
Surely... if you insist.

889
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,723
There'd be no point in my staying.

890
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:55,385
- May I invite someone for dinner?
- Certainly.

891
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:57,178
Reginald durant. You know him.

892
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:59,564
Yes. I've heard a great deal
about him lately.

893
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:03,352
No doubt. He does very interesting things.

894
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:08,198
Well, I'll be there by 6:00.
I hope everything works out all right.

895
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:11,531
It will when grace sees
how lovely my wife is.

896
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:13,161
I'm sure.

897
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:17,540
Particularly, if we convince her
that we're very much in love.

898
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:20,999
I'll try very hard to be convincing.

899
01:03:23,842 --> 01:03:26,959
W-where did you stop
when you were in Paris?

900
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:31,130
Durant loaned me the sweetest little villa
you've ever seen.

901
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:34,892
I haven't seen it.
You must. Sometime.

902
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,847
We expect to live there.

903
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:42,307
Why are you marrying durant?

904
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,396
Is there any reason why I shouldn't?

905
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:52,029
Have you noticed the ring he gave me?

906
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,868
Don"t you like it? =no.

907
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:01,743
Besides, it hides your wedding ring.

908
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:05,459
Oh, I think the poor little wedding ring
has always wanted to hide.

909
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:08,124
I think it feels sort of useless.

910
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:10,926
Don't make a joke of our marriage.

911
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:15,966
Mr. Stanton, my almost former husband,
used to have a sense of humor.

912
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:18,635
- What's happened to it?
- Please call me gaylord.

913
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,553
- Gaylord.
- Thank you.

914
01:04:20,732 --> 01:04:24,350
You know, husbands and wives are supposed
to know each other's first names.

915
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,142
And as for sense of humor,

916
01:04:26,321 --> 01:04:29,688
my former secretary,
miss brenner, wasn't especially gifted.

917
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:33,029
- I think you'd better call me Sylvia.
- Sylvia...

918
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:36,616
And it's really too bad you couldn't
have known some of the things I thought.

919
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:38,997
They were quite funny.

920
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,453
That's probably Reginald.
He's generally early.

921
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,619
Well, you needn't be
so obviously glad to see him.

922
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:45,287
Why not if I am?

923
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:49,128
Oh, Sylvia, I wish nobody
were coming tonight.

924
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:51,964
Just you and I. Yes?

925
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,254
I'd like to... to...

926
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:56,840
To talk to you.

927
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:58,383
Good evening.

928
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:03,100
- I hope I'm not too early.
- Oh, no. No, indeed.

929
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:04,889
Glad to see you, gaylord.

930
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:11,487
I missed you at tea this afternoon.

931
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:12,802
That's what love does to you.

932
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:15,067
It makes you terribly lonely,
no matter where you are...

933
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:17,531
If she isn't there.

934
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:18,820
So I've heard.

935
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:21,705
I don't think you'd better
talk about love to gaylord.

936
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:26,119
Men so dislike discussing things
they don't understand.

937
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:27,878
Will you excuse me a moment?

938
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:39,591
If she does marry you,
I hope she makes you very uncomfortable.

939
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,179
Thanks, but she won't.

940
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:43,674
She's the most gracious,
most charming, the best humored...

941
01:05:43,815 --> 01:05:44,815
Yes, I know. I know.

942
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,353
I'm quite sure you don't,
but it doesn't matter.

943
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:50,610
But it was nice of her to come all the way
back here to settle things fairly.

944
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,896
Huh. You mean, uh, just to see you.

945
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:55,010
- Well, put it that way if you want.
- Well, she didn't.

946
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:57,901
She returned to New York to see someone
that she was once in love with.

947
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,057
She wasn't in love with anyone
when she married me.

948
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:00,820
Are you sure?

949
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:02,143
- Quite.
- I don't believe it.

950
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:03,967
- So let me tell you...
- I"'m not interested.

951
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:06,480
You're not capable of knowing
anything about a girl as decent as Sylvia.

952
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:10,713
Ha! When did you turn angelic?
I married Sylvia, and as long...

953
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:15,510
While grace is here, Sylvia is playing
that she's very much in love with me.

954
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:18,179
- Now, don't mess it up.
- Oh, well, I won't help you any.

955
01:06:21,186 --> 01:06:22,642
Darling.

956
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,224
- Well, why so solemn?
- Oh, it's nothing. Nothing.

957
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:27,389
And look who's here.

958
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:31,151
Ponce de Leon and the modern crusader
rolled into one has returned.

959
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:32,857
- Just like old home week.
- Quite.

960
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:34,612
- Hello, Reggie.
- Hello.

961
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:36,522
- When did you get back?
- This morning.

962
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:39,659
- And you hurried right up to see papa?
- Yes.

963
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:46,916
Gaylord, does he know
they still print magazines?

964
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:49,577
- Hello, prodigal. Glad to see you back.
- Well, Richard.

965
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:53,418
- He's not the main prodigal.
- What do you mean by that?

966
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:57,006
- Ah, it's a surprise.
- I don't like surprises.

967
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:58,670
Congratulations, dear.

968
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:01,076
Uh, thank you. What have you been doing
with yourself, Sheridan?

969
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,056
Don't bother him. He's suffering.

970
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:06,641
- With gout?
- No, mental cruelty. His wife left him.

971
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:11,183
I thought her life was filled
with flowers and canary birds.

972
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,898
Uh, one of the canaries started to sing.

973
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:17,359
Too bad, Sheridan. Too bad.

974
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:19,741
Yes, I guess you'd have to marry me now.

975
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:22,869
And a dirty shame.
It'll bust up a swell romance.

976
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,414
Darling, what's the matter
with you tonight?

977
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:28,995
Oh, nothing. Nothing important.

978
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:31,456
Something's happened. I...

979
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:39,093
I'm sorry I was late dressing for dinner,
darling.

980
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:43,673
- Am I forgiven?
- Oh.

981
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:47,560
I only returned this morning. I can't
resist kissing him every now and then.

982
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:52,186
But, angel,
I don't know some of our guests.

983
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,567
Oh, of course. This is Mrs. Lawrence,

984
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,853
miss munson, and this is greer.

985
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:58,271
How do you do?

986
01:07:58,449 --> 01:08:01,407
- Uh, Mr. Sheridan, I...
- Yes, I know Mr. Sheridan.

987
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:03,614
Good to see you again.
=and Mr. Richards.

988
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:06,996
How are you and dear Mrs. Richards?
Well, I hope?

989
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:09,122
Unfortunately.

990
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:10,750
Hello, Reggie.

991
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,662
- You don't have to kiss him.
- Are you sure?

992
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,582
You seem to have recovered
your health, Mrs. Stanton.

993
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:19,459
Uh, yes, I, uh...

994
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:23,221
I'm sure it's a great relief to gaylord
to know you're quite well again.

995
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:24,130
It must be...

996
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:26,800
I told grace
all about your, uh, illness, dear.

997
01:08:26,978 --> 01:08:30,345
- Oh, I see. You...
- He didn't say just what the trouble was.

998
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:33,856
Uh, well, um...
I suffered from, uh, heart trouble.

999
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:35,107
Is it curable?

1000
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:40,193
Oh, yes. I had excellent care... in Paris.

1001
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:43,699
Well, I think, dear, you could have been
taken care of just as well here.

1002
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,326
Do you really think so?

1003
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:48,203
Are you staying in New York long,
Mrs. Stanton?

1004
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:50,160
I'm not certain.

1005
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:53,827
I needn't ask you,
because you'll have to go when she does

1006
01:08:54,005 --> 01:08:56,667
if you're to continue
to get into all the pictures.

1007
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:00,708
He is bold coming here, don't you think?

1008
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:04,254
Either that or just a bit foolish,
don't you think?

1009
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:09,017
- I haven't thought.
- Well, you should. You really should.

1010
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:14,583
I'd like to choke her, gaylord.
Did you hear what she said to me?

1011
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:18,560
Hmm? About her health?
=never mind her health. You heard her.

1012
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:22,105
- Look at her. Well?
- Well, uh, what are you trying to tell me?

1013
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:24,323
You expect me to know a woman like that,
you're mad.

1014
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:26,317
- Is she married to you?
- Certainly.

1015
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:29,058
You expect me to associate with a married
woman who's openly having an affair with...

1016
01:09:29,082 --> 01:09:29,912
Now, how do you know?

1017
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:32,369
Whether she's your wife or not
is beside the point.

1018
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:35,869
- What's she grinning about?
- I really...

1019
01:09:36,047 --> 01:09:38,504
- Have you told her you're divorcing her?
- I have no grounds.

1020
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:41,291
Don't say that again. You tell her now.

1021
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:44,490
I can't stand to see that silly grin
another minute. I want her to realize...

1022
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:47,472
All right, all right.
You tell her before dinner.

1023
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:50,133
All right.

1024
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:57,273
Did you hear her?
"Ll don't know our guests.”

1025
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:58,979
Have you ever met such nerve?

1026
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:01,109
"And how is dear Mrs. Richards?"

1027
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,646
She spoiled my whole evening.

1028
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:05,531
She hasn't spoiled mine yet.

1029
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:09,411
Well, she will. That's what wives are for,
to spoil other people's evenings.

1030
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:12,663
Why did you drag me into this alcove?

1031
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:14,324
Don"t you see? No.

1032
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:16,102
I've done everything I'm supposed to do.

1033
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:18,336
I've pretended to be a loving wife and...

1034
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:21,248
Oh, I wish they'd go home
and then we could discuss the divorce.

1035
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:23,917
- Well, I won't divorce you.
- Then I'll divorce you.

1036
01:10:24,095 --> 01:10:25,756
Shh.

1037
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:28,971
Look in the mirror.

1038
01:10:35,273 --> 01:10:37,059
- Oh, kiss me.
- I won't.

1039
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,315
Please. You must.

1040
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:44,904
Well, look as though you enjoyed it.
You promised.

1041
01:10:58,588 --> 01:10:59,588
Music.

1042
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:01,796
Yes. Just to drown out my words

1043
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:05,675
in case I happen to tell you
what I really think of you.

1044
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:07,676
I just want them to see, not hear.

1045
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:10,964
- Oh, they can see all right.
- They're staring.

1046
01:11:11,142 --> 01:11:13,537
My goodness. You know,
grace looks funny with her mouth open.

1047
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:15,517
- Oh, forget her.
- She's why we're here.

1048
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:18,475
- Let's talk about ourselves.
- That would be interesting.

1049
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:20,329
Did you think about me when you were gone?

1050
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:22,024
No.

1051
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:24,356
I never wanted to see you again.

1052
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:29,986
Liar.

1053
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:31,492
Ow!

1054
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:34,654
Perhaps you're right,
but I love to stick you with pins.

1055
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:36,368
I'm glad you're back.

1056
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:39,163
Even with pins.

1057
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:54,345
- Sylvia, darling.
- No, don't say anything.

1058
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:57,261
Oh, I wish she'd go home. I'm tired.

1059
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,271
Oh, grace, what in the world has happened?

1060
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:10,177
- Calm yourself.
- I'm sorry.

1061
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:12,237
Don't get so excited. Please.

1062
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:13,571
What's the matter?

1063
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:16,909
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm nervous.

1064
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:20,416
- It was an accident.
- Oh, it's quite all right.

1065
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:22,451
Dinner is served.

1066
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:23,710
Shall we?

1067
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:30,919
Could we wait just a minute?
I'd like to powder.

1068
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:33,463
Certainly. Uh, ten minutes.

1069
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:35,302
Very good, madame.

1070
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:36,476
Will you come with me?

1071
01:12:36,561 --> 01:12:38,847
Please, don't trouble.
I know my way about.

1072
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:42,354
I have no doubt.
But I've moved the powder.

1073
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:48,152
Aren't you overdoing it a little?

1074
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:50,153
You're making Sylvia very uncomfortable.

1075
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:51,780
She's married to me.

1076
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:53,942
You might remember
that I'm in love with her.

1077
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:04,251
It does seem changed somehow.

1078
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:06,458
I thought you'd notice.

1079
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:08,964
- Lovely, isn't it?
- Very.

1080
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:11,501
Isn't gaylord thoughtful?
You know, when I came home,

1081
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,716
he had all sorts of powder
and things here just for...

1082
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:16,847
Persons who happen to drop in.

1083
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:18,428
Very thoughtful.

1084
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:21,473
- You want there?
- In a minute.

1085
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:24,514
By the way, what did you do
with the things you found here?

1086
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:26,853
Threw them out. You wouldn't?

1087
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:28,643
But I would.

1088
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:31,980
We'd better understand each other.

1089
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:33,989
Do you know, I thought we did.

1090
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,741
Are you going to divorce him?

1091
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:38,369
No. On the contrary, I've forgiven him.

1092
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:42,202
I think we have an excellent chance
to be very happy.

1093
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:44,332
You've forgiven him.

1094
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:46,039
Has he forgiven you?

1095
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:49,213
You've been playing around with durant.

1096
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:52,216
I've heard things, I've seen pictures.

1097
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:56,595
It isn't improper to be seen
in a picture with a gentleman.

1098
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:59,348
I'm not ashamed. I don't care. I love him.

1099
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:02,260
And I love him.
And I can keep you just where you are.

1100
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,708
You'll never marry him because
I'll never let him divorce me.

1101
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:06,188
Never! Do you understand?

1102
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,608
Um, do you wish powder?

1103
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:13,146
- I'd like gun powder.
- You'd like it perhaps.

1104
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:16,782
But you're not fool enough
or courageous enough to use it.

1105
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:18,693
I'm leaving!

1106
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:22,739
I'll take everyone with me.
I'll ruin your triumphant dinner.

1107
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:26,993
You know, I was hoping you would.

1108
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:31,778
- Get my things and take me out of here.
- Oh, what's happened?

1109
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:34,341
Plenty. Are you going to
take me out of here?

1110
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:37,128
Oh, uh, Sylvia,
uh, grace wants to know if we're taking...

1111
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,547
Oh, if you do that, I'll... ohh!

1112
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:43,430
Mrs. Lawrence,
haven't you forgotten something?

1113
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:44,764
No!

1114
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:53,773
I believe Mrs. Lawrence
did forget something.

1115
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:55,609
She wished you all to leave with her.

1116
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:57,364
- What?
- Not you.

1117
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:02,953
After all I've meant to you,
if you had one spark of manhood...

1118
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:05,160
- What's happened?
- None of your business.

1119
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:06,540
Oh, you probably coached her.

1120
01:15:06,711 --> 01:15:09,043
I haven't the remotest idea
what you're talking about.

1121
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:12,376
So she's an invalid. Huh!

1122
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:14,131
Are you coming? =no.

1123
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:15,962
Then you'll never see me again.

1124
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:17,627
- Well, I'll try and bear up.
- Ohh!

1125
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:19,645
Can you imagine?
What's the matter?

1126
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:22,640
Why, uh, Mrs. Stanton said that grace
wanted us to leave with her.

1127
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:24,095
Sol do.

1128
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:29,640
Mrs. Stanton wishes a nice, quiet evening
at home with her husband and her lover.

1129
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:31,102
Sap!

1130
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:34,401
This has all the earmarks

1131
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:38,531
of a very pleasant evening
spent at home with Mrs. Richards.

1132
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:39,781
Come on, dear.

1133
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:45,951
You seemed to have accomplished
your purpose. Let's get out of here.

1134
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:49,959
- Yes, but we haven't had dinner yet.
- Plenty of places for that.

1135
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:53,917
I know, but, uh,
I have some packing to attend to.

1136
01:15:56,927 --> 01:15:58,588
Do you want to stay?

1137
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:01,428
A little while.

1138
01:16:01,599 --> 01:16:06,468
You see, I have some things
I must talk over with my husband.

1139
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:09,762
- Will it take long?
- No, not long. You send gaylord to me.

1140
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:12,147
- What about dinner, madame?
- Uh, later.

1141
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:22,609
- Oh, you're still here.
- So are you.

1142
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:27,447
Uh, we may not be dining for some time.

1143
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:31,459
- In fact, we may call dinner off entirely.
- Indeed.

1144
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:35,338
- We, uh, hate to inconvenience you though.
- Oh, how thoughtful of you.

1145
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:38,625
There's some really charming restaurants
quite nearby.

1146
01:16:38,803 --> 01:16:41,795
Uh, yes. So Sylvia said. Thank you.

1147
01:16:41,972 --> 01:16:45,052
When she's put a few things together
and told you just what she thinks of you,

1148
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:46,807
we'll dine in one of them.

1149
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:08,578
Sylvia. Yes?

1150
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:10,330
- Sit down.
- No.

1151
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:17,421
I have an awful lot I want to tell you.

1152
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:19,673
I'm not so sure I want to hear.

1153
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:22,506
Sylvia, do you love durant?

1154
01:17:23,681 --> 01:17:26,263
I don't ask you whom you're in love with.

1155
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:28,344
I'm going to tell you anyhow.

1156
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:42,022
It isn't strange at all.
It's very true and very real.

1157
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:49,199
Why do you doubt me?

1158
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:52,664
I can't help it.

1159
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:54,621
Why?

1160
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:56,911
You don't love durant.

1161
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:59,045
Are you in love with anyone?

1162
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:02,587
Yes, I'm in love.

1163
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:05,173
With me?

1164
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:09,306
If I were in love with you,
it wouldn't be because you had a new suit.

1165
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:15,395
- Oh, Sylvia, I...
- That's what it amounts to, isn't it?

1166
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:18,649
You say you love me. How do I know you do?

1167
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:22,277
Before I went to Paris, you...
Well, certainly, you...

1168
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:27,821
Were you in love with grace?
=no. Nor she with me.

1169
01:18:27,995 --> 01:18:30,327
Why, love never even entered into it.

1170
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:33,113
It's what you think of as love.

1171
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:36,250
No, my dear, there was a time, but...

1172
01:18:37,588 --> 01:18:39,124
Oh, don't you see?

1173
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:43,211
What you think of as love
is nothing more or less than...

1174
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:45,592
Well, an emotional hurdle race.

1175
01:18:46,597 --> 01:18:48,553
And what do you win?

1176
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,680
You're the last hurdle.

1177
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:54,764
And as long as I live,
you'll be the prize.

1178
01:18:54,939 --> 01:18:56,899
Will you please tell
Mrs. Stanton I couldn't wait?

1179
01:18:56,941 --> 01:18:58,977
I have a boat for Paris to catch.

1180
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:02,476
Something I missed over there last trip.

1181
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,646
- Beg pardon, sir?
- No, nothing. Nothing.

1182
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:09,859
It's curious how attractive
a girl can be on a honeymoon

1183
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:12,449
without a husband.

1184
01:19:12,623 --> 01:19:14,409
I must remember that.

1185
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:17,165
I know I shouldn't trouble you, but...
What?

1186
01:19:17,336 --> 01:19:19,372
I was wondering about dinner, sir.

1187
01:19:19,546 --> 01:19:22,959
Oh. Oh, I shouldn't bother them tonight.

1188
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:26,045
But, uh, they'll need a hearty breakfast.

1189
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:31,847
I'm going to hold you closer
than you've ever been held before.

1190
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:34,929
I've never been held close at all.

1191
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:39,313
As far as my life is concerned,
it's been... been...

1192
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:41,940
Empty? - Yes.

1193
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:46,229
Sometimes I've been very lonely
and regretted it.

1194
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:49,816
But tonight, I'm glad.
