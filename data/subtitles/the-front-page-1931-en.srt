1
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,610
We're all ready to shoot it, Jacobi.
Ready whenever you are.

2
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,840
Say, Henry!

3
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,060
The rope for that last hanging danced that guy
up and down like he was on a rubber band.

4
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,600
Williams only weighs 134.

5
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,560
Addin' a couple of pounds for breakfast,
the way those guys always eat,

6
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,770
that brings it up to 136.

7
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,980
Keep it up till you get the spring out
of it. We want this one's neck broke.

8
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,280
All right.

9
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,460
Hey, what's the idea throwin'
things out of the window?

10
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,880
Quit playing with that gallows.
How do you expect us to do any work?

11
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,590
Well, you cut that yellin'.

12
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,720
I'll get the sheriff after you bums!

13
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,520
Ain't much respect
for the press around here.

14
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,140
- How's the wife, Ed? Any better?
- Worse.

15
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,770
And me havin' to hang around all day and
night, waitin' for 'em to hang that cuckoo.

16
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,650
It's hard work, all right.

17
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,230
Crack it for a dime.

18
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,030
- Hey, Schwartz, what do you do?
- By me.

19
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,570
- What time is it, anyway?
- 4:30.

20
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,660
- Stay.
- Me too.

21
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,660
These cards are like washrags.
Let's chip in and get a new deck.

22
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,000
These are good enough for me.
I'm 80 cents out already.

23
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,210
Faber 1059.

24
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,840
Hey, take this phone.

25
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,890
Ernie, you ain't doing anything!

26
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,770
Are you guys crippled or something?

27
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,560
Criminal Courts Building, press room.
Just a minute, please.

28
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,940
Hello, Sarge. McCue.
Yeah, I phoned. Anything doing?

29
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,490
All right. Thank you, Sarge.

30
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,610
- Two Johns.
- Say, Ernie.

31
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,910
Why don't you take your instrument
into the library and play it.

32
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,960
Hello. Is this the home
of Mrs. F.D. Margolies?

33
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,800
This is Mr. McCue of the CityNews Bureau.

34
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,090
Is it true, madame, that you were
the victim of a peeping Tom?

35
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,350
Ask her if she's worth peeping at.

36
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,770
Madame, that ain't the right attitude
to take. All we want is the facts.

37
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,060
- Tell her I can run up for an hour.
- Tell her to come over here.

38
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,310
We'd like to reenact the crime.

39
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,900
Just a minute, madame.

40
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,900
Is it true, Mrs. Margolies,
you took the part of Pocahontas

41
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,700
in the Elks' Pageant seven years ago?

42
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,490
Hello? She hung up.

43
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,580
Now, I wonder
who was peeping in her tepee.

44
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah?

45
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,130
No, Hildy Johnson ain't ̶

46
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,460
Hello, Mr. Burns.
No, Hildy hasn't shown up yet.

47
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,720
Hello, Bensinger.

48
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,220
I just had an interview with Williams
over in the death house.

49
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,100
That jail...
That jail is reeking with germs.

50
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,770
Believe me, the board of health is going to
hear about the sanitary conditions over there

51
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,360
through my paper.

52
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,980
It's amazing to me that those prisoners
can live long enough to be hung.

53
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,450
What's the idea, Mac?

54
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,870
- Say, is that the only telephone in this place?
- It's the only one with a mouthpiece.

55
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,330
How many times have I gotta tell you fellas
to let my phone alone?

56
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,000
If you want to talk through a mouthpiece,
go and buy one like I did.

57
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,370
Whitney 9000.

58
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,540
The germs of the mouth are the most
contagious, the most malignant ̶

59
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,340
Shut up, Listerine!

60
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,670
Whitney 9000.

61
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,510
- What is this, a hospital?
- Yeah, Roy. How's your pimple coming along?

62
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,930
Hello, Sarge. McCue.
Anything doing?

63
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,020
Say, you don't have to use my desk
for a garbage can either.

64
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,860
Say, how would you like to quit stinking
up this place with those antiseptics?

65
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,190
- Anything new on the hanging, Bensinger?
- My deal, ain't it?

66
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,450
- Hey, Zonite!
- What is it?

67
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,530
Question before the house. Gentleman wants to
know if there's anything new on the hanging.

68
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,790
- Nothing special.
- Did you talk to the sheriff?

69
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,290
Why don't you get your own news?

70
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,670
Somebody oughta see the sheriff.

71
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,750
Criminal courts press room.

72
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,420
No, Hildy Johnson ain't ̶

73
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,800
Yes, Mr. Burns, why ̶

74
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,010
No, Mr. Burns.

75
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,510
Yes, Mr. Burns.

76
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,140
Good-bye, Mr. Burns.

77
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,310
Walter Burns for Hildy again.
Something must have happened.

78
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,640
I'll tell you what's happened.
Hildy's quit.

79
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:47,320
Nerts. Hildy? Why, he can't quit.
He's a fixture on the Morning Post.

80
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,360
Yeah, he goes with the woodwork.

81
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,950
- Well, he told me he was gonna quit.
- Walter Burns wouldn't let him quit.

82
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,950
He'll find a way to keep him somehow.

83
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,950
Remember what he did to Fenton
when he wanted to go to Hollywood?

84
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,370
Got him into a fight, then had him
thrown into jail for assault and battery.

85
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,000
Gimme a rewrite.

86
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,540
Well, if he ain't quit, why ain't he here
covering the hanging?

87
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,630
- I wish I could quit.
- Hello, Emil. Ready?

88
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,510
Dr. Irving Zobel ̶

89
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,800
"Z" for zebra, "O" for onion,
"B" for baptize, "E" for anything,

90
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,390
"L" for, uh... "L" for, uh...

91
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,680
Don't tell him, anybody.

92
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,020
"L" for Listerine.

93
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,270
With offices at 1608 Inverness Avenue.

94
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,190
Well, this bird was arrested tonight
on complaint of a lot of angry husbands.

95
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,490
They say he's been treating their wives
with electricity at a dollar a crack.

96
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,290
- The electric teaser's in again!
- I understand he massages them too.

97
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,330
Well, anyway, this doctor's
being held for malpractice

98
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,960
and the station house is full of his
patients claiming he's innocent.

99
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,130
But from what the husbands say,
it looks like he's a lothario.

100
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,970
All right.

101
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,720
Main 6800.

102
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,140
Press. No, Mr. Burns, Hildy Johnson ̶

103
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,730
I'm not lying, Mr. Burns.

104
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,020
Walter acted like
he was having a hemorrhage.

105
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,530
- Did you find Johnson, sir?
- No.

106
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,830
- Then I'll have to put another man on the job.
- In your hat, Duffy.

107
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,830
I'm after that bunch of lily-livered,
pockmarked peanut politicians

108
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,460
who think they're running this town,

109
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,090
and Hildy Johnson's the only man
on the staff I can trust tonight.

110
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:36,170
- But we have to have somebody.
- We've gotta have Johnson!

111
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,840
But you haven't got him!

112
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,100
Butch!

113
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,400
Butch, I want Hildy Johnson.

114
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,400
Tell the boys of the downtown deliveries
to find him, and fast.

115
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,530
Fifty dollars to the man
that brings him in.

116
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,280
- Where's Diamond Louie?
- Right there.

117
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,320
Hey, Wishiesky! O'Rourke!

118
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,910
Louie!

119
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,250
Hey, Louie!

120
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,080
- Louie, come here.
- Hello, boss.

121
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,750
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, where you going with that money?

122
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,130
Don't do that.
What's the matter with you?

123
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,390
Hildy Johnson is missing!
I want him! Get going!

124
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,470
I'll deliver him. You know what I mean?

125
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,650
Hildy Johnson here?

126
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,530
- He's on the wagon!
- Well, I ain't.

127
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:43,160
You remember me.
I was here last night with Mr. Benchley.

128
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,410
- Mr. Benchley's still here.
- Good!

129
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,120
Hello, Louie.

130
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,580
Hello, baby.

131
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,790
Hey, Dot. You seen Hildy Johnson?

132
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,880
- I haven't seen that newsie in months.
- No?

133
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,710
- Hello, baby.
- Hi.

134
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,860
Hi, Leezie. I'm looking for Hildy Johnson.

135
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,160
- Why?
- Walter Burns wants to see him.

136
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,820
- And I want to see Walter Burns.
- What for?

137
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,580
Two dollars.

138
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,710
Two dollars, please.

139
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,420
I'm sorry.

140
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:41,590
Well, darling, you're almost mine.

141
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:50,520
I'd write the Society notes to get a look at
Walter Burns' face when he hears of this.

142
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,350
I'd write 'em for a year to see him when
he hears I'm getting married.

143
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,860
I'd write 'em for two years to get
a load of what he says when he hears

144
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,570
I'm leaving town for New York.

145
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,530
What's the matter?

146
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,700
So that's why you got that ̶
Walter Burns.

147
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,620
That's why you're going to marry me ̶
Walter Burns.

148
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,790
That's why you're going to New York ̶
to spite Walter Burns.

149
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,250
Honey, you're crazy. Now listen.

150
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,920
Dear, did you ever come up out of a sewer?

151
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,430
Listen, honey, did you ever...

152
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,190
Mmm.

153
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,440
Did you ever come up out of a sewer
and have the cool, fresh air hit you?

154
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,570
Well, I did, and, honey,
you're the cool, fresh air.

155
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,070
You've made a fresh-air fiend of me, dear,

156
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,620
and I'm not going back there
unless you send me.

157
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,950
Then, Hildy, you go right up
to Walter Burns and resign.

158
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,460
What, and have him get his hands on me?

159
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:00,800
That's why I been hiding out at your place ̶
to keep away from that double-crossing maniac.

160
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,300
Tell you what I'll do.
I'll resign by phone.

161
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,720
- And to get a look at that snake's face then...
- No, you don't.

162
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,970
Here.

163
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,100
What, 500? And in one bill?

164
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,890
Uncle sent it to me for a wedding present.

165
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,560
I wasn't going to give it to you
until we got there.

166
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:22,780
But you take it, and after you
take me home, you get the tickets.

167
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,200
Instead of getting married tonight,
we'll be married tomorrow.

168
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,530
Instead of going to New York tomorrow,
we'll go to New York tonight.

169
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,170
All we have to do is throw the old underwear
in the trunk 24 hours earlier, that's all.

170
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,880
What is it, Mother?

171
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,050
- Do you know what I think?
- What?

172
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,310
I think you must be
a sort of irresponsible type,

173
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,850
or you wouldn't do things this way.

174
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,810
Now, Mother, you stop picking on my Hildy.

175
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,860
He didn't do one blessed thing
to help our getting away.

176
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,660
- You better get busy.
- Okay.

177
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,890
That's the dress you had on
the first night I met you.

178
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,810
♪ You're the one I care for ♪

179
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,650
Here.

180
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,020
Wait a minute.

181
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,110
Was that the dress you had on
the night you said no?

182
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,200
Come here.

183
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,020
The movie house.

184
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,020
This could be another
Iroquois Theater disaster.

185
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,440
If I only had a cameraman with me ̶
a full page of pictures.

186
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,980
Frightful carnage
snapped by the Morning Post.

187
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,650
"Faulty fire exits execute hundreds.

188
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,660
Exposé of theater owners started by the
Morning Post. City board to investigate."

189
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,820
What a chance, what a chance.

190
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,040
Listen, I'm gonna go downtown and see
that Mother gets aboard. See you later.

191
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,750
But, Hildy...

192
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,000
Hello, Hildy. I'd like to have a little
talk with you for about 15 minutes.

193
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,590
Not a chance, Walter. I'm busy.

194
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:54,140
Not too busy to be playing around the
neighborhood, turning in false fire alarms.

195
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,970
- What?
- Hello, Mac.

196
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,310
Hello, Mr. Burns.

197
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,730
All right, Walter.

198
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,990
Boy, I wish I could find
the guy that did this.

199
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,990
I'd make that box his tombstone.

200
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,620
Aren't you gonna ask me
how I found out where you were?

201
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,910
Yeah, a big scoop, with everybody
in the county building working for you.

202
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,500
- Set 'em up.
- None for me.

203
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,590
He'll take the same.

204
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,300
So you're leaving me for marriage. Why?

205
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,260
None of your business.

206
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,770
How'd it happen?

207
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,390
There was a moon.

208
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,440
Well, I guess that lets me out.

209
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,190
I'll give you a farewell party.

210
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,940
Thanks.

211
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:57,870
But it hurts, Hildy, your not telling a
fellow, after all I've done for you.

212
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,160
You mean after all you've done to me.

213
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,250
That time you sent me down in the lake
to test that trick diving suit.

214
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,870
That suit was about as waterproof
as your straw hat.

215
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,880
It took 'em half an hour to pull me up.
It was lucky I only went deaf.

216
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,420
Didn't I go to the expense of hiring an airplane
to take you up so you'd get your hearing back?

217
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:16,880
To the further expense of bribing the pilot so
he'd land in the middle of a strike massacre?

218
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,510
You scooped the whole world, made yourself
the envy of every newspaper man alive.

219
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,140
Aw, well, it was worth it at that.

220
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,980
Even if I did get ridden
out of town on a rail,

221
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,480
with eight bullet holes
in a hat that cost me six bucks.

222
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,490
- And charged on the expense account at 15.
- And got away with it.

223
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,200
Those were the days.

224
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,450
Well, you'll certainly
have a lot to tell the kids.

225
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,790
Yeah. What kids?

226
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,500
You're getting married.

227
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,380
Well, why not?

228
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,840
A guy's gotta settle down sometime.

229
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,510
Get a home and a wife.

230
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,970
They say it's kids
that hold it all together.

231
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,680
That's right.

232
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,230
I never was big enough
to let a nice girl reform me

233
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,440
so I could stay in a two-room love nest
at nights with the wife and kids

234
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,570
while the fellas were out
having a lot of fun.

235
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,740
Marriage does make
a respectable citizen out of a man.

236
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:20,410
It must be grand. You never have to
worry about a place to go.

237
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,410
You always know where you're going, home.

238
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,000
None of this idiotic
jumping around at all hours

239
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,750
and having to be on the inside
of all the crazy excitement in this town.

240
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,380
Dear.

241
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,250
The 5:15 out to some quiet suburb,

242
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,800
a home-cooked dinner
every night at exactly 7:00.

243
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,430
And by 10:00 in bed,

244
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:43,510
unless after the tapioca the wife has
some friends in for a neighborly chat.

245
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,520
I don't blame you, Hildy. It sounds great.

246
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,570
Excuse me a minute, will ya?

247
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,710
Come on, Schwartzy boy, deal 'em out.
Don't let that deck get cold.

248
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,930
See if you can deal me
a decent hand this time.

249
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,220
Hello, Woodenshoes. Any news?

250
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,140
I just been over to the death house.

251
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,310
Did you hear what Williams said
to the priest?

252
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,770
- Forget it!
- Yeah, I know, I know.

253
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,980
The paper's full of the hanging.
We ain't got room for the ads.

254
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,110
- What did Williams say?
- He said that he ̶

255
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,400
- Come on, ante up, ante up.
- I've anted twice already.

256
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,700
He said to the priest
that he was innocent.

257
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,450
He'll start crying in a minute.

258
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,000
Why don't you send the poor nut some roses,
like that girl of his, Molly Malloy?

259
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,210
Now there's an idea.

260
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,710
Yeah. You know,
she thinks he's innocent too.

261
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:57,710
You fellas don't understand.
Now, I talked to ̶

262
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,130
Before you go on, Woodenshoes,

263
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,130
would you mind running down to the corner
and getting me a hamburger sandwich?

264
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,800
- Bet two.
- Three cards.

265
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,890
Personally, my feeling is ̶

266
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,760
Make that two hamburgers,
like a good fellow.

267
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,720
- Now, my feeling is...
- Yeah?

268
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,850
...that Williams
is of the dual personality type.

269
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,560
Yeah, I know, I know.
Like the Dolly Sisters.

270
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,020
Yeah, that's right.
Tell it to the Tribune.

271
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,570
- I'll raise you.
- I'll raise you. What'll you do?

272
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:25,280
It's on account of the way
his head is shaped.

273
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,950
- It's a typical case.
- Sure.

274
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,830
Ask 'em to put a lot
of ketchup on them sandwiches.

275
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,040
That beats me.

276
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,040
I thought you fellas might be interested
in the psychological end.

277
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:39,130
Make mine plain lettuce on gluten bread.

278
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,960
Get me a sandwich too, Woodenshoes.

279
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:44,590
- First one I got tonight.
- What do you got?

280
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,140
Where? Where am I gonna get
the dough for all these eats?

281
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,850
- Charge it!
- You've got a badge, haven't ya?

282
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,520
What's it good for?

283
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,100
Four hamburgers.

284
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,860
And a lettuce.

285
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,780
On gluten!

286
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,620
Hello, Mr. Burns.
Why, no, we haven't seen Hildy.

287
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,620
- Hiya, slaves!
- Where you been?

288
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,200
He's got a shave!

289
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:15,120
It's Walter Burns on the wire.
Talk to him, will ya, Hildy?

290
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,380
Tell that paranoiac
to take a sweet kiss for himself.

291
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,760
Come on, Ernie. Sound your "A."
♪ Good-bye forever ♪

292
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,510
Listen, Hildy. Will you do me
a personal favor and talk to Walter?

293
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,970
He's called up about nine million times.

294
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,760
What's the matter, Hildy?
Are you afraid of him?

295
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,100
I'll talk to that maniac with pleasure.

296
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,690
Hello, Mr. Burns.

297
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,770
What's that, Mr. Burns?

298
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,570
Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns.

299
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,490
Say, listen, you crazy baboon!

300
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:47,660
Get a pencil and paper and take this down.
And get it straight, because it's important.

301
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,570
It's the Hildy Johnson curse.

302
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,280
The next time I see you,
no matter where I am or what I'm doing,

303
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:55,040
I'm gonna walk right up to you
and hammer on that monkey skull of yours

304
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,500
till it rings like a Chinese gong!

305
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,540
- Ouch!
- That's tellin' him.

306
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,880
No, I ain't gonna cover the hanging.

307
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,720
I wouldn't cover Washington crossing the
Delaware for you if he did it all over again.

308
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,300
Never mind the Vaseline, Jocko.

309
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:13,310
It won't do you any good this time
because I'm going to New York.

310
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,220
Ha! I didn't tell you that, did I?

311
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,730
And if you know what's good for you,
you'll stay west of Gary, Indiana,

312
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,730
because a Johnson never forgets!

313
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,520
And that, boys, is what is known
as telling the managing editor.

314
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,270
- Why'd you quit?
- I'm getting married.

315
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,780
You see those? Three to New York tonight.

316
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,030
- Tonight?
- Yes, sir.

317
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,030
- What do you mean, three?
- Me and my girl and her darling ma.

318
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,740
Look! He's in love.

319
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,160
Tootsie Wootsie!

320
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,910
Is she a white girl?

321
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,660
Has she got a good shape?

322
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,670
Does Walter know you're getting married?

323
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,790
Does he know? Shook hands like a pal.
Offered to throw me a farewell dinner.

324
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,460
That's his favorite joke ̶
farewell dinners.

325
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,170
He poisons people at them.

326
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,630
Gimme Tucker 2164, will ya?

327
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,800
Yeah, he got me into Polack Mike's,
filled me full of rotgut.

328
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,300
I'd have been there yet
if it hadn't been for the toilet.

329
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:58,060
Can you imagine that guy, trying to break
up my marriage after shaking hands?

330
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,770
Hello, Peggy. How are you, darling?

331
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,110
I know, but ̶

332
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,360
You bet I resigned.
Right in his face. Didn't I?

333
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,990
The 11:18 tonight. Yeah.

334
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,780
No.

335
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:17,290
Why, the press room. Just dropped in
to say good-bye to the boys, yeah.

336
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,710
Not a chance, honey.
I've got a taxi waiting.

337
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,620
Yeah. Ten minutes. Bye-bye, honey.

338
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,790
Hey, where's the wedding?

339
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,760
It's in New York, so you guys
ain't gonna have any fun with it.

340
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,880
No fake warrants
or kidnapping the bride with me.

341
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:34,430
Everybody's getting this New York bug.
It's a rube town for mine.

342
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,810
You wanna look out, Hildy. They tell me
all those New York reporters are lizzies.

343
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,140
Remember that one from New York
last summer, with the "doiby"?

344
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,980
Now, there. There was a man.

345
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:48,230
"Boys, listen, could any of you gentlemen
tell me where the telegraph station is?"

346
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,570
You wanna look out, Hildy.
You'll be talking like that.

347
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,570
Which one of those sissy journals
you going to work for?

348
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,450
None of them.
Who wants to work on a newspaper?

349
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:57,160
Lot of hoboes, full of dandruff and bum gin
they wheedle off of aldermen.

350
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,370
- What are you going in for, the movies?
- The advertising business.

351
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,460
A hundred and 50 smackers a week.

352
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,960
- What?
- A hundred and 50 what?

353
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,380
Well, there's the contract.

354
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,340
Ain't you guys got anything
better to do down there?

355
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:16,010
It is 150.

356
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,510
- You're gonna miss a sweet hanging.
- I'm not interested.

357
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,100
He's going to write poetry
about milady's drawers.

358
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,400
Can you imagine punching a time clock,

359
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,150
sitting around with a lot of stuffed shirts
talking statistics?

360
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,980
Why, you'll be like a fire horse
tied to a milk wagon.

361
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,160
Listen to who's talking. Journalists.

362
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,280
Peeking through keyholes, running after
fire engines like a lot of coach dogs,

363
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:41,790
waking people up in the middle of the night
to ask them what they think of Mussolini,

364
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:45,000
stealing pictures off of old ladies of their
daughters that get attacked in Grove Park.

365
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,460
Daffy buttinskies, swelling around with holes in
their pants, borrowing nickels from office boys.

366
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,960
And for what? So a million hired girls and
motormen's wives will know what's going on.

367
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,510
Your girl must have handed you that line.

368
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,470
I don't need anybody to tell me
about newspapers.

369
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,800
I've been a newspaper man for 15 years, a
cross between a bootlegger and a galoofer.

370
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,890
And you'll all end up on the copy desk,

371
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,560
gray-headed, hump-backed slobs,
dodging garnishees when you're 90.

372
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,940
You'll be out in the street
the minute your contract's up.

373
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,940
No, not me.
My girl's uncle owns the business.

374
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,650
- Has he got a lot of jack?
- Choking him!

375
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,980
What do you think he gave us
for a wedding present?

376
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,360
A dozen doilies!

377
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,450
$500 in cash.

378
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,070
There ain't 500 in cash.

379
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,830
There it is, except what it cost
to get those tickets to New York.

380
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,330
- Let me count that.
- No, you don't.

381
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,370
Boys, boys, just a minute, please.

382
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,380
- How about a little bite?
- Scram!

383
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,710
Jenny!

384
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:37,180
Can I wash up now, please?

385
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:41,180
Yes. This place is beginning
to smell like a... like an owl's foot.

386
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,890
You don't want to wash up
on a night like this.

387
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,350
I'm going away. This is a holiday.
Come on, give us a kiss.

388
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,980
- Hildy Johnson, you keep away from me!
- What's the matter? Ain't I your fella anymore?

389
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:56,240
- I'll hit ya! I'll hit ya, I will!
- Come on, Jenny. I'll tell you what we'll do.

390
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,450
You and I'll go around and say good-bye
to everybody in the building.

391
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,870
But we can't take this with us.
Come on, Jenny. Come on.

392
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,410
Hey! Look!

393
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:09,370
Come on, Jenny!
♪ Waltz me around again, Jenny ♪

394
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,630

00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,340

396
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,380

397
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,630

398
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,720
Get outta here!

399
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,110
- Look here, fellas!
- How are ya, Sheriff?

400
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,610
- Any news?
- Who dumped that out of this window?

401
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:38,450
We promised not to tell.

402
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,910
- Who threw it?
- Judge Mankiewicz threw it.

403
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:44,370
He was in here with his robes on,
playing fireman.

404
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:50,420
Come on, now, fellas. I know who it was.
It was Hildy Johnson, wasn't it?

405
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,000
- Where is he?
- Out with a lady.

406
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:57,260
I swear, I don't know
what to do with you boys.

407
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,260
I've a durn good mind to take
this press room away from you.

408
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,850
Stop it!

409
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,520
Wouldn't that be too bad.

410
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,690
The place is so full of cockroaches,
you can't walk.

411
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,360
Personally, I don't give two hoots.

412
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,740
But how do you suppose it looks
to have a lot of hoodlums

413
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,490
yelling and throwing things
out of the window?

414
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:24,950
Besides, there's someone
in that death house.

415
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:28,410
How do you suppose he feels,
listening to all this revelry?

416
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,410
A lot you care how he feels.

417
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,370
We're doing everything possible to ̶

418
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,380
To get your whole ticket
reelected next week.

419
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,090
Yes, when Williams drops through that
trap tomorrow, it means a million votes.

420
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,720
Can we help it if the people rise

421
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,340
to support this administration's
stand against the red menace?

422
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:46,760
Personified by Mr. Earl Williams, a guy
who loses the job he's held for 14 years,

423
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,770
joins a parade of the unemployed

424
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:51,100
and, because he's goofy from lack of food,
waves a red undershirt.

425
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,980
Williams is a dangerous radical.
And he killed a policeman.

426
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,520
Williams is a poor bird who had the
tough luck to kill a colored policeman

427
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,530
in a town where the colored vote counts.

428
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:01,240
♪ And they're hangin' Danny Deever ♪

429
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,780
♪ In the morning ♪

430
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,280
- You...
- Keep your shirt on, Pinky!

431
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,910
And I don't want to hear
anymore of that Pinky stuff.

432
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,960
I got a name, see. Peter B. Hartman.

433
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,680
Stop it!

434
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,930
"Pinky." How does that look to the voters?

435
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:30,640
Like I had sore eyes or something.

436
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,690
Just a minute, fellas. Just a minute.

437
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:41,070
Now, Pete, how about the favor
that a certain party is asking?

438
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:45,070
Once and for all, will you hang this person
at 5:00 AM instead of 7:00?

439
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,530
It can't hurt you,
and we can make the city edition.

440
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:52,750
Roy, you can't hang a fella in his sleep
just to please a newspaper.

441
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,830
No, but you can keep postponing the hanging
so it'll come just before the election.

442
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,340
Yes.

443
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,960
With this new alienist coming in,
how do we know there'll be a hanging?

444
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,260
- Yes.
- What if this professor finds he's insane?

445
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,670
Yes.

446
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,510
- He won't find he's insane.
- No?

447
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,680
No! Because he ain't!

448
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,560
Williams is as sane as I am.

449
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,810
Saner.

450
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,150
Yes.

451
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,270
Now, here's a "resumy" of the situation.

452
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,360
The newspapers have got to
put their shoulders to the wheel.

453
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,240
What do ya do, gents?

454
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,990
They've gotta impress on these Bolsheviks

455
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,580
that a death warrant for Earl Williams

456
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:36,210
is a death warrant for every bomb-throwing,
un-American red in this town.

457
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:40,840
This hanging means more
to the people of this fair city today...

458
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,500
- I bet two.
- I'll stay.

459
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,050
Drop.

460
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,760
That's a statement, Jimmy.

461
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,260
Why don't you go home?

462
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,890
All right, you'll just get scooped.

463
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:57,520
We're going to reform the reds with a rope.
That's our slogan.

464
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,400
You can quote me if you want to.
"Sheriff Hartman pledges"...

465
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,570
Peoria! We've been
printing this chestnut for weeks.

466
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,700
- Ain't you gonna use that?
- Sure.

467
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,700
Give me the desk. This is Bensinger.

468
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,500
The sheriff refuses to
move the hanging up one minute.

469
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,210
No, I won't.

470
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:20,380
That hanging's coming off
exactly as per schedule.

471
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,500
7:00 in the morning
and not a minute sooner.

472
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:26,380
There's such a thing
as being humane, you know.

473
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,930
All right, all right.
Just wait till you want a favor.

474
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,550
Give me a rewrite.

475
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,010
♪ 7:00 in the morning ♪

476
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,930
Hoo boy!

477
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,900
Jake? New lead on the hanging.

478
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,610
And don't use Hartman's name in this
at all. Just say "the sheriff."

479
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:47,860
Why can't they jerk these guys
at a reasonable hour

480
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,110
so we can get some sleep?

481
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,410
This new alienist, Dr. Max J. Egelhoffer ̶

482
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,460
That's right. From Vienna.

483
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,250
He's going to examine Williams
at the request of the, uh,

484
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:04,290
"United Federation for World Betterment."

485
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,220
My. One of the biggest.
Author of that book, The Personality Gland.

486
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,970
And Where to Put It. Bet a dime.

487
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,640
Just autographed a copy for me.

488
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,060
Did he bite his initials in your pants too?

489
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,970
Wait, there's more.

490
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:21,650
That doctor's the 14th pair of whiskers
they've sent in on this case.

491
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,440
Those alienists make me sick.

492
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,020
All they do is tickle ya,
then send ya a bill for 500 bucks.

493
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:29,190
- Give me the desk.
- Here's the situation on the eve of the hanging.

494
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,320
Hello, this is Murphy.
More slop on the hanging.

495
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,950
A double guard has been thrown
around the jail, municipal buildings,

496
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,830
railroad terminals and elevated stations

497
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:41,160
to prepare for the expected general uprising
of radicals at the hour of execution.

498
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,540
Ready?

499
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:45,000
Sheriff Hartman's just put
four more hundred relatives on the payroll

500
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,000
to protect the city
against the red menace,

501
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,760
which is leaving Moscow
in a couple of minutes.

502
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,220
Up a dime.

503
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,470
Sheriff Hartman... "The sheriff"

504
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,890
has just received four more letters
threatening his life,

505
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,060
which he is going to answer
by a series of raids.

506
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,140
And to prove to the voters that
the red menace is on the square,

507
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:05,150
Sheriff Hartman has just written himself
four more letters threatening his life.

508
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:09,230
Yes, yes, I know he wrote 'em
on account of the misspelling.

509
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,860
- Drop.
- That's all.

510
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,450
Except the condemned man
ate a hearty dinner.

511
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:17,660
Mock turtle soup, chicken pot pie,
hashed brown potatoes,

512
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,120
combination salad and pie à la mode.

513
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,210
The doomed man
ate a hearty meal as follows:

514
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,790
"Noodle-a-zoop,
roast-a beef, sweet-a-potato,

515
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,960
cranberry sauce, stromberry pie
and a great big hunk of pastrami."

516
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:31,010
Statement from who? The sheriff?

517
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,720
Quote him for anything you want.
He can't read.

518
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:37,010
Kruger calling.

519
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,470
Nothing new on the hanging.

520
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:44,270
And say, Jake, get this in for me
as a big favor, will you?

521
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:49,270
The whole meal was furnished
by Charlie Apfel, who, uh ̶

522
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,980
Apfel.

523
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,400
No, A ̶

524
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,280
"A" for adenoids, "P" for psychology,
"F" for Feen-a-mint,

525
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,070
"E" for epilepsy and "L" for, uh, uh ̶

526
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,200
uh, "L" for, uh...

527
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,920
"lay an egg."

528
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,340
Certainly, this is Bensinger talking.

529
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:14,010
The proprietor of
the Apfel-Wants-To-See-You restaurant.

530
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:16,180
That's it, yes. Thank you.

531
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,390
Shamey, shamey!

532
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,850
Stinky Bensinger's
going in for petty graft again.

533
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,680
That means a new hat for somebody.

534
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,100
I understand that's how
Bensinger gets all his clothes.

535
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,310
Sure, the greasy spoon
gave him that overcoat

536
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,730
when George "Kid" Cukor swung.

537
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,320
If they ever stop hanging people,
he'll probably go naked.

538
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,320
Why don't you
make a poem out of it, Roy?

539
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,450
Hello, Molly.
...oh. There's a gleam in her eye.

540
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,910
Don't look at me, baby.
I didn't say a word.

541
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,660
Hello, kid! How's the old tomato can?

542
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,660
Sure'n how are youse, Molly?

543
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,870
- Been looking for you tramps.
- Those were swell roses you sent Earl.

544
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,880
What do you want done with them
tomorrow morning?

545
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,170
- A lot of wise guys, ain't ya?
- What do you want in here?

546
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:56,800
- Tell you what I think of you. All of you.
- Keep your skirts on.

547
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:01,720
If you was worth breaking my fingernails
on, I'd tear your face wide open.

548
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:05,100
What are you sore about, sweetheart?
Wasn't that a swell story we gave you?

549
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,730
Yeah.

550
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,940
You crumbs have been
making a fool out of me long enough.

551
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,860
She oughtn't be allowed in here. Yesterday
I caught her using the drinking cup.

552
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,360
I never said I loved Earl Williams and
was willing to marry him on the gallows.

553
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:21,910
You made that up, and about my being his
soul mate and having a love nest with him.

554
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,410
You've been sucking around that cuckoo
ever since he's been in the death house.

555
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,370
Everybody knows you're his affinity.

556
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,460
That's a rotten lie.

557
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,920
I met Mr. Williams just once in my life,

558
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,920
when he was wandering around in the rain
without his hat and coat on, like a sick dog,

559
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,630
the day before the shooting.

560
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,340
I went up to him like any human being
would, asked him what was the matter.

561
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:44,510
He told me about being fired after
working at the same place for 14 years.

562
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,850
I took him up to my room
because it was warm there.

563
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:49,520
Put that on your Victrola.

564
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,400
Just because you want to fill your lying
papers with a lot of dirty scandal,

565
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,400
you gotta crucify him
and make a tramp out of me.

566
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:58,320
Got a match?

567
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,530
I tell you, he just sat there
talking to me all night.

568
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,450
- Never once laid a hand on me.
- ...oh.

569
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,580
In the morning he went away

570
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,830
and I never saw him again
till that day at the trial.

571
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,830
Tell us what you told the jury.

572
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,420
Go on, laugh.

573
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,670
I'd like to know some curses
bad enough for your greasy souls.

574
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,050
Sure, I was his witness ̶
the only one he had.

575
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,430
"Witness."

576
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:26,310
Yes, me, Molly Malloy,
a common streetwalker.

577
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,770
The only one with guts enough
to stand up for him.

578
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,600
That's why you're persecuting me ̶

579
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:33,650
'cause he treated me decent
and not like an animal, and I said so.

580
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:36,190
Go into your dance, kid.
This is the press room. We're busy.

581
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,490
- Why don't you go and see your boyfriend?
- Better hurry. He's left a call for 7:00 AM.

582
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:43,910
It's a wonder a bolt of lightning
don't come down

583
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,990
and strike you all dead.

584
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,290
What was that?

585
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,760
They're fixing up a pain in the neck
for your boyfriend.

586
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,130
What's the idea?

587
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,850
Now, now. Don't get hysterical.

588
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:10,390
Shame on you.

589
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,940
Why, I didn't say anything.

590
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:17,650
A poor, crazy little guy
that never did anybody any harm,

591
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:21,820
sitting out there alone, this minute,
with the angel of death beside him,

592
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:23,950
and you cracking jokes!

593
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,620
Listen, if you don't shut up,
I'll give you something to cry about.

594
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,620
- Keep your dirty hands off of me!
- Come on. Outside, tramp!

595
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,660
- Outside! Outside!
- Get away from me, will ya!

596
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,080
You'll pay for this
with your greasy souls!

597
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,930
- Do you guys wanna play some more poker?
- Aw...

598
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,320
Here now. Tickets for the hanging.

599
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,660
- Two for each paper.
- What do you mean, two?

600
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,410
- What do you want to do, take your family?
- Hey, listen, Pete ̶

601
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,410
The boss wants a couple
for the advertising department.

602
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,540
- I promised a pair to ̶
- This ain't the Follies.

603
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,960
Aw, big-hearted Pinky.

604
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,630
I'm getting tired of your editors using
these tickets to get advertising accounts.

605
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,050
You got a lot of nerve. Everybody knows
you use them to get in socially.

606
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,970
Yeah, you had the whole Union League Club
over at the last hanging.

607
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,970
Trying to suck in with the swells, huh?

608
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,140
I suppose you'll wear a monocle
tomorrow morning.

609
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,890
Now, boys, that ain't the way to talk.

610
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:39,730
If any of you want a couple of
extra tickets, I'll...

611
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:44,240
I'll be more than glad to take care of you.

612
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,240
But for goodness sake, don't kill it.

613
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:55,200
Hiya, boys. We cleaned up!

614
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:58,670
Here, here, here. Get that copy
of the Morning Post out of there.

615
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,960
Johnson, what do you mean by
throwing things out of the window?

616
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,010
- Answer me! Who do you think you are?
- Who wants to know?

617
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,550
You think that you and Walter Burns
are running this town.

618
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,560
Well, I'm going to send a bill
to the Post tomorrow

619
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,720
for all the wreckage committed
around here in the last year.

620
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:16,350
- How do you like that?
- That's swell.

621
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,350
- You know what else you can do?
- What?

622
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,860
Guess.

623
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,860
You stick your nose in this building
tomorrow and I'll have you arrested.

624
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,570
That's almost worth staying for.

625
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:28,450
I'll tell you something else,
and you can pass it on to Walter Burns.

626
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,450
The Post get no tickets for this hanging
on account of the lies they been printing!

627
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:34,870
Listen, you pot roast, if I wanna go to your
hanging, I'll go, and I'll sit in a box!

628
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,290
No, you won't.

629
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,870
- I'd only have to tell half of what I know.
- You don't know anything.

630
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,250
I know who occupied room 602 at a certain
hotel the night before the last hanging.

631
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,880
Oh.

632
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,760
That hotel crack just doubled him up.

633
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,760
- Say, Sheriff.
- Press room.

634
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,970
Tell me, just what hotel was that?

635
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:52,600
For you, Sheriff.

636
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,520
Sheriff Hartman talking.

637
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,940
- Hello, dear.
- Must be Irma.

638
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,690
No, I can't come home.

639
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:07,690
I've got too many things to do first.
Getting ready for the hanging.

640
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,860
Why don't you take him out
to your house and hang him?

641
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:14,160
- I'll call you later, Irma.
- It is Irma.

642
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,290
I gotta see an alienist.

643
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:19,250
No, alienist.

644
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,330
Not for me! For Williams!

645
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,880
Press room. Who?

646
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,550
Hey, Hildy. Your girl.

647
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,180
Hello? McCue!

648
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,690
Hello, Peggy.

649
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,520
How are you, darling?

650
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:46,070
Yay! Sandwiches!

651
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,940
- How about my plain lettuce?
- Hamburger for me.

652
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,950
- I ordered one, didn't I?
- You did not.

653
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,490
This way, Woodenshoes!

654
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,490
Why, darling, what's the matter?

655
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,200
I distinctly said gluten.

656
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:00,620
But listen, sweetheart, I just dropped in
to say good-bye to the fellas.

657
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,710
Do you remember I told you?

658
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:07,750
Say, will you guys talk or something?

659
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,840
Yes, I got a taxi waiting.

660
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,130
Hey! Go easy on that ketchup.

661
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,840
I'm responsible for it.

662
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:17,510
Listen, dear, I got the tickets
right in my pocket.

663
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:21,140
Now listen, honey, if you talk like that
I'm gonna go jump in the lake.

664
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:24,150
I swear I will, because I can't stand it.

665
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,310
- Listen.
- We're listening.

666
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,400
I love you.

667
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:31,320
♪ I said I love you. ♪

668
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,280
Aw, give him a break, Ernie!

669
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,780
Well, that's more like it.

670
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,240
Feel better now?

671
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:40,200
Well, smile!

672
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:42,290
And say something.

673
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,790
Well, you know what I want to hear.

674
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,880
Come on. Tell me you love me.

675
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,630
Well, come on! Tell me you love me!

676
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:53,010
Tell him you love him
and we'll all go to sleep.

677
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,340
That's the stuff!

678
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:58,010
- Yeah?
- Will you wear that little blue straw hat?

679
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,680
- Wait a minute and I'll see.
- Are you happy now?

680
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:04,270
I'll bet you're not as happy as I am.

681
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:06,940
Well, I'll bet you anything you want.

682
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:11,190
All right, darling. I'll be there in five
minutes. Really, this time. Bye-bye.

683
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:15,030
Hildy, here's Walter again.
Tell him to give us a rest, will ya?

684
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:21,910
You're making a nuisance out of yourself!
What's the idea of calling up all the time?

685
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,080
No, I'm through with newspapers!

686
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,210
Who cares what you think of me? I'm going to
New York tonight, right now, this minute!

687
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,670
You...

688
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:34,050
Hey!

689
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,550
- Have you gone screwy?
- Hey, Pinky!

690
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,550
Stick that among your souvenirs!

691
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,430
Hildy, you'll get us
in an awful jam!

692
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:44,060
If Walter calls up again, tell him to put it
in writing and send it to Hildebrand Johnson,

693
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:47,940
Waterbury-Adams Corporation,
735 Fifth Avenue, New York City.

694
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,360
- Please, Sheriff.
- Huh?

695
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:57,990
Please.

696
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,910
Excuse me, Professor.

697
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,370
I ain't afraid to die. I ain't afraid.

698
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:09,040
- Don't work too much the first day, kid.
- Good-bye, "Yonson."

699
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:12,090
I'll drop you a line
and let you know what Walter says.

700
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,710
So long, Hildy!

701
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,920
Be careful of that
treacherous New York weather, Hildy.

702
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,340
So long, tramp.
Don't forget to send us a postal card.

703
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,800
Drop in and see us
if you ever come back, kid.

704
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:23,720
- Where'll we see you again, Hildy?
- Riding in a Rolls-Royce,

705
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,930
giving out interviews on "successing."

706
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,940
You...

707
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,610
Mmm.

708
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:40,450
And now we shall reenact the crime.

709
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,240
- Have you a gun, Sheriff?
- Huh?

710
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:44,910
- A gun.
- Yes.

711
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:57,510
Now, think that I am the policeman.
You understand?

712
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,930
I am the policeman.

713
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:03,260
Now, where exactly did you stand?

714
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:05,600
Show me.

715
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:19,150
- Hildy, I hope you got a return-trip ticket.
- You'll be back next week.

716
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:23,870
And then what did you do?

717
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:29,080
Dementia praecox!

718
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,710
Good-bye, you wage slaves.

719
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:36,170
When you're crawling up fire escapes,
getting kicked out of front doors,

720
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,210
eating Christmas dinners
in one-armed joints,

721
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,130
don't forget your old pal Hildy Johnson.

722
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,590
And as the road beyond unfolds...

723
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,140
Spread out, you fellows!

724
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:54,520
- It's a jailbreak!
- Jacobi, what's the matter? What's happened?

725
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:01,530
Look out where you're aiming, will ya!

726
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:03,610
Watch the gate!
Probably trying the gate!

727
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,280
- Who got away? Who was it?
- Earl Williams!

728
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:09,370
Earl Williams?

729
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:12,830
Hurry! Hurry up! This is important!

730
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,670
- Gimme the desk!
- Jailbreak! Call you back!

731
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,750
- Earl Williams just escaped!
- Call you back!

732
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,630
- I don't know yet!
- Look out!

733
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,430
- Williams just went over the wall!
- Look out!

734
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,720
Give me Walter Burns, quick!

735
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:34,230
Hello, Walter? Hildy. Get this!

736
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:36,150
Earl Williams just lammed
out of the county jail.

737
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,690
Yep. Yep! Yep!

738
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:39,940
Don't worry, Walter!
I'm on the job! Right!

739
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,960
Hey, Jacobi!

740
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:05,050
Five minutes' talk with me
will get you 260 bucks!

741
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:23,400
Endicott.

742
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:25,860
No, no, I tell you, no one knows
where he got the gun.

743
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:28,990
He ran up eight flights of stairs to the
infirmary, got out through the skylight.

744
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,490
He must have slid down
the rain pipe to the street.

745
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:35,040
- Murphy. Give me the desk.
- No, no one knows where he got it.

746
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,330
- Call you back.
- No clue yet to Earl Williams' whereabouts.

747
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,340
The crime commission is offering $10,000
reward for the capture of Earl Williams.

748
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,760
Call you back.

749
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,880
Hello. Here's a feature for you.

750
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:47,390
Tear bomb. Yeah, a tear bomb.

751
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:48,970
Criminals cry for it.

752
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:51,430
If the mayor wants me,
he knows where I am!

753
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,810
This bomb went off accidentally in the
hands of Sheriff Hartman's bombing squad.

754
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:56,440
What went off?

755
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,440
The following deputy sheriffs
were taken to the emergency hospital.

756
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,060
A fine, fair-weather friend you are!

757
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:01,650
- Benny J. Glazor.
- After all I've done for you.

758
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:03,650
- Herman Walstein.
- Putting things like that in the paper.

759
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,650
- Sidney Matsburg.
- That's gratitude for you!

760
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,820
Danny Koo.

761
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:10,700
- Kruger calling.
- McCue. Give me the desk.

762
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,700
A man answering Williams' description

763
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:15,370
was seen boarding a southbound
Cottage Grove Avenue car

764
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,250
by motorman Julius A.Lindbergh.

765
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:18,920
Sidelights on the manhunt.

766
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,550
Yeah, Lindbergh. I thought it'd make
a nice feature on account of the name.

767
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:26,590
Mrs. Richard Watts Jr.,
age 55, scrub lady,

768
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,180
while at work scrubbing the eighth floor
of the Commerce Building,

769
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:32,720
was shot in the left leg by one of
Sheriff Hartman's special deputies.

770
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:34,850
I'll rush right after it.

771
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:41,230
- There goes another scrub lady.
- Any dope yet on how he got out?

772
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,650
The sheriff let him out
so as he could vote for him.

773
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:45,650
Where do you suppose
Williams got that gun?

774
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:48,400
Give me Walter Burns, quick!

775
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:57,000
Hello, Walter? Hildy.
I just got the whole story from Jacobi.

776
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,290
- Exclusive?
- Right. And it's a pip.

777
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:01,670
Only get this: it cost me 260 bucks, see.

778
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:04,250
- Don't waste time. Give me the story.
- All right. I'm telling you.

779
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:07,840
I had to give Jacobi all the money I had.
It wasn't exactly mine, and I want it back.

780
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,930
- How'd he get the gun?
- Did you hear what I said about the money?

781
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:12,010
- Yes. Now, go on.
- All right.

782
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,890
Boy, it's the jailbreak of your dreams.

783
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:18,850
This profound thinker from Vienna
decided to make Williams reenact the crime.

784
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,980
- Well? Well? Well?
- Well, I'm coming to it! Will you shut up?

785
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,650
Of course, he had to
have a gun to reenact it with.

786
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:26,780
- And who do you suppose supplied it?
- Who?

787
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:30,070
Peter B. Hartman. "B" for brains.

788
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,910
No, I'm not kidding.

789
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:34,410
The sheriff gave his gun to the professor,
the professor gave it to Earl,

790
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,490
and Earl shot the professor
right in the belly.

791
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:39,910
The professor's in the hospital, Williams
has evaporated and the sheriff's gone nuts.

792
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,920
Ain't it perfect?

793
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,920
- Fine work, Hildy.
- Save the violets.

794
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,670
I want that money, 260 bucks.

795
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:50,470
No, I tell you, I'm not gonna cover
anything else. I'm going away.

796
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:53,140
Listen, that's the money
I gotta get married on.

797
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:56,350
I just did this as a personal favor.

798
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:59,350
I gave Jacobi all the money I had on me,
and I want it back!

799
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:00,850
When will you send it over?

800
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,570
- Right away, Hildy.
- Tell him to hurry. I'll wait for him here.

801
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,400
Hello, Peggy.

802
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,360
How are you, darling?

803
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:15,320
What was that?

804
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:17,990
I was just telling Walter
I was all through, that's all.

805
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,750
You haven't done something
foolish with our money?

806
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:21,290
No.

807
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:23,540
Then I think I'd better
take care of it from now on.

808
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:26,630
Listen, sweetheart, everything's
going to be perfectly all right.

809
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:29,300
- Then you haven't got it.
- Well, no, not right now.

810
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:32,840
But he's going to send it over. Walter,
I mean. The boy'll be here any minute.

811
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:34,260
Walter. Hildy!

812
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,560
Aw, listen, sweetheart, I wouldn't
have had this happen for the world.

813
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,680
- But this is what happened ̶
- I know.

814
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:43,230
Well, I can't tell you if you won't listen.

815
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:47,060
I had to give Jacobi the money so he
wouldn't give the story to the other papers.

816
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:49,400
Every time I've wanted you for something ̶

817
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,400
my birthday, New Year's Eve,
when I waited up till 5:00 in the morning ̶

818
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:55,780
Well, I know, but a big story broke.

819
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:58,580
It's always a big story.

820
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,620
The biggest story in the world.

821
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,910
And the next day
everybody's forgotten it, even you.

822
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,920
What do you mean, forgotten?

823
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,540
That was the Clara Haman murder
on your birthday.

824
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:12,300
It won't hurt to wait just a few minutes. And
the boy's on his way with the money now.

825
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,010
Mother's downstairs in a taxicab.

826
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:17,890
I'm just ashamed to face her.

827
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:20,100
If she knew about that money ̶

828
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,470
It's all we've got in the world, Hildy.

829
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,640
We haven't even got a place
to sleep, except the train.

830
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:27,650
Listen, honey, I'll tell you what we'll do.

831
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:31,150
You and Mother have the baggage checked.
There are the tickets.

832
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:32,860
You mean you're not coming?

833
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,950
Why, yes, I'm coming.
I'll meet you at the information booth.

834
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:39,780
It's all that Walter Burns.
You simply can't resist him.

835
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:42,160
Him? I wouldn't raise a finger
if he was dying.

836
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,660
- McCue talking.
- Hello, Mac.

837
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:47,040
Dear, this is Mr. McCue.
Mac, this is my girl.

838
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:49,750
Pleased to meet ya.

839
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:54,300
Here's a feature on the manhunt
that'll knock you right on your ̶

840
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:57,180
- Excuse me, miss.
- Wait a second.

841
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:01,640
Mrs. Phoebe DeWolfe, 861 and a
half South Euclid Street, colored.

842
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,060
Well, she became the mother
of a pickaninny in a patrol wagon

843
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:07,770
with Sheriff Hartman's rifle squad
acting as nurses.

844
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:10,860
You should've seen 'em, miss.

845
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:15,110
I'm gonna put our
things in the car, dear.

846
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,620
Well, Phoebe was walking along the street
when all of a sudden she began ̶

847
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,990
Right.

848
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:26,160
So the police coaxed her into the patrol
wagon and started a race with the stork.

849
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:29,750
When the baby was born they examined him
carefully to see if it was Earl Williams,

850
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:32,040
who they knew was hiding somewhere.

851
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:39,640
They named the baby Peter Hartman DeWolfe
in honor of the sheriff.

852
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:43,930
And they all pitched in a dollar a piece

853
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:47,810
on account of it being
the first baby ever born on a manhunt.

854
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,610
Wait a minute. Here's the mayor himself.

855
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:53,980
- Maybe there's a statement.
- Don't pester me now, please.

856
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:56,530
- I got a lot on my mind.
- His Honor won't say anything.

857
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:57,820
- Have you seen Sheriff Hartman?
- No.

858
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,700
What effect's this jailbreak
gonna have on the colored voters?

859
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,280
Not an iota.

860
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:05,040
In what way can
an unavoidable misfortune of this sort

861
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:08,120
influence the duty of every citizen,
colored or otherwise?

862
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:15,380
Your Honor, tell me,
is there a red menace or ain't there?

863
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:17,800
Hartman, I've been looking for you.

864
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,510
- So have we.
- What's the dope, Pinky?

865
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:21,720
- Who engineered this getaway?
- Just a minute, fellas.

866
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,220
- We've got him located.
- Williams?

867
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,140
- Where?
- Where he used to live.

868
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:29,390
The rifle squad is just starting out.
You can catch them if you hurry.

869
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,600
Pete! I want to talk to you.

870
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:34,730
I haven't got time, Fred, honest.
I'll... I'll see you after.

871
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:35,940
Pete!

872
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:39,190
Did you actually give Williams that gun?

873
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,660
Well, the professor asked me for it.

874
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,910
I thought it was for something scientific.

875
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:46,490
Pete, I...

876
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:50,000
Kruger calling.

877
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:54,040
Here's a red-hot statement
from the governor.

878
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:56,170
The governor claims
the mayor and the sheriff

879
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:59,880
have shown themselves to be a couple
of eight-year-olds playing with fire.

880
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:01,880
Quote him as follows.

881
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:05,350
"It's a lucky thing for the city
that next Tuesday is election day,

882
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:09,770
as the citizens will thus be saved the expense
of impeaching the mayor and the sheriff."

883
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:11,390
That's all.

884
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:13,650
Hi, Your Honor.

885
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:19,780
Pete, I've got a mighty
unpleasant task to perform.

886
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,990
Fred, you're just gonna get me rattled.

887
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:24,490
I've already sworn in 400 deputies.

888
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:26,830
Do you want to bankrupt
this administration?

889
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:29,330
Well, I'm getting them
for only $12 a night.

890
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:32,210
Twelve dollars for those
rheumatic uncles of yours,

891
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:35,040
out there shooting up everybody
they can see for the fun of it?

892
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:36,920
But, Fred!

893
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:39,300
Pete, you're through.

894
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:41,840
Now, don't appeal to my sentimental side.

895
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:44,260
I don't know what to say, Fred.

896
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:47,970
A thing of this kind almost ruins
a man's faith in human nature.

897
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:50,600
- Pete.
- But our families, Fred.

898
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,770
I've always looked on Bessie
as my own sister.

899
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:55,770
If there was any way out...

900
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,690
But there is a way out.

901
00:51:57,770 --> 00:51:59,860
Just give me a couple of hours, will ya?

902
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:01,570
Hello.

903
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:03,150
400 suppers?

904
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,660
Nothing doing.
This is a manhunt, not a banquet.

905
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:09,660
That $12 covers everything.

906
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:12,160
That gives you an idea
of what I'm up against.

907
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:15,460
We're up against a lot more than that
with that nutty slogan you invented ̶

908
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,920
"Reform the reds with a rope."

909
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,460
There ain't any reds and you knew it.

910
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:22,670
Well, why go into that now, Fred?

911
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:27,090
The slogan I had was all we needed to win ̶
"Keep King George out of our city."

912
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:31,270
Is Sheriff Hartman in there?

913
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:33,060
It's for me.

914
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,060
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You looking for me?

915
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:39,520
You certainly are a hard man to find.

916
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:40,940
- Huh?
- I been...

917
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:43,190
What do you want?

918
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,950
I'm a messenger at the state house.

919
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:49,200
- This is from the governor.
- What's from the governor?

920
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,120
The reprieve for Earl Williams.

921
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,330
- For whom?
- Earl Williams.

922
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:55,540
The reprieve.

923
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:59,750
The governor gave me his word of honor
that he wouldn't interfere two days ago.

924
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,960
And you fell for it. Pete, it frightens me
what I'd like to do to you.

925
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,880
Here's what it says...

926
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:07,970
He's gone!

927
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:17,520
Was there anybody here for me,
Woodenshoes?

928
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,940
- No, Mr. Johnson.
- The double-crossing louse.

929
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:22,440
Now, it's all right. D-Don't worry.

930
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:24,690
We just want to ask you
a couple of questions.

931
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,650
The trouble is, nobody's
using the right psychology of...

932
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:30,030
- You got 260 bucks?
- No, sir.

933
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,120
But I got a way of making it, and more.

934
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,040
- Cherchez la femme.
- What?

935
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,370
Who is it that's been defending Williams,
hanging around him?

936
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:42,960
I ain't got time for that drip. I gotta get
260 bucks in the next five minutes.

937
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:46,380
It'll take longer than five minutes
to get it. I know where Williams is.

938
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:50,180
Sure! He's getting his head blown off by the
rifle squad. But that don't get me my dough.

939
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:53,390
- He's with that girl, Molly Malloy, that's where.
- Aw, shut up.

940
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:56,060
Remember. You never delivered this.

941
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:58,770
You got caught in the traffic or something.

942
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:01,190
Now, d-don't let anybody see you.

943
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:03,440
Yeah, but how am I going to know?

944
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,190
Come and see me at my office tomorrow.

945
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:08,740
What's your name?

946
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,620
Pincus.

947
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,410
All right, Mr. Pincus.

948
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:18,660
All you've got to do is to lay low
and keep your mouth shut.

949
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:20,370
Here.

950
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,250
You go to this address.

951
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:26,510
It's a nice, homey little place, and, uh,
you can get anything you want.

952
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,300
Tell them Fred sent you.

953
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:31,720
Okay, Fred.

954
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,320
Can you imagine, Woodenshoes? This time
tomorrow I'd have been a gentleman.

955
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,400
- At last, Louie! Have you got the dough?
- Huh?

956
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:50,320
- She sent him a lot of roses, didn't she?
- Yeah. Stick your roses.

957
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:52,610
Come on, Louie. Give me the dough.
I'm in a hurry.

958
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,490
- I'll bet you I'm right.
- You...

959
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,240
No, not you.

960
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,250
- What are you talkin' about?
- Didn't Walter send you over here?

961
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:03,130
Sure. In case you need any help.
You know what I mean?

962
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:04,710
Yeah, but the 260 bucks.

963
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:07,090
- What 260 bucks?
- The money I spent on the story.

964
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,420
Walter promised to send somebody,
but I can't wait, so ̶

965
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:11,930
- So what?
- You always got a lot of dough on you.

966
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:14,430
- So you want from me, huh?
- Yeah.

967
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:17,560
Well, I don't know. That's a lot of money.
You know what I mean?

968
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,560
Listen, my whole future's
depending on this.

969
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,560
My girl's waiting at the train.
We're going to New York tonight.

970
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,480
I've only got 15 minutes. If you promise
to give me this, Louie, I swear that I'll ̶

971
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,690
Walter, he's gonna give to me the works
if I help you to run out on him.

972
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:31,650
He knows I'm goin'. He gave me permission. I
just did him a swell favor. We're pals again.

973
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,320
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

974
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:35,660
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do with you.

975
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:39,040
- I'm gonna take the chance.
- That's the stuff!

976
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:42,040
I'll write you a note.
Give it to Walter and get the dough.

977
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,500
- You're a white man, Louie.
- I'll tell you what I'll do.

978
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:47,960
I'll give you 150 bucks for the debt.

979
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:49,800
Hey, wait a minute.

980
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,430
- That's takin' advantage.
- Well, it's the best what I can do.

981
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:56,640
- I lose almost a hundred bucks that way.
- Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

982
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,350
That's 110 you lose.

983
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,310
Say, Louie, give me 200, will ya.

984
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:04,060
150.

985
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:06,770
All right. Give me the dough.

986
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:14,070
Hey, look. What it says on there?

987
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,030
Read it, you mug!

988
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:20,120
Sure. That's right.

989
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,370
Well, good-bye and good luck.

990
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:34,050
I'm gonna look you up in New York
if there's anything wrong with this.

991
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:36,680
You know what I mean?

992
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,810
Ten, 20, 30, 40 ̶

993
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:46,770
Ten, 20, 30, 35...

994
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:48,520
Ten, 20, 30, 40 ̶

995
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:50,230
Ten, tw ̶

996
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,980
Anyway, I'll get out of this place.

997
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:55,610
They're after me with searchlights.

998
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,490
Put down that gun!

999
00:56:57,570 --> 00:57:00,660
It ain't loaded.
I fired all the bullets already.

1000
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:02,330
Holy...

1001
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:09,920
I surrender.
I couldn't hang on that roof any longer.

1002
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,090
I ain't afraid to die.

1003
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:16,170
I was tellin' the man that
when he handed me the gun.

1004
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:19,050
Waking me up in the middle of the night,

1005
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,390
talkin' to me about things
I don't understand,

1006
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:23,140
callin' me a Bolshevik.

1007
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:26,310
I'm an anarchist.
It's got nothing to do with bombs.

1008
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:29,900
It's the philosophy
that guarantees every man's freedom.

1009
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:33,480
And all those poor people
being crushed by the system.

1010
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:36,650
And the boys... The boys
that were killed in the war.

1011
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:41,070
And in the slums,
all of those slaves to a crust of bread.

1012
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,370
I can hear them crying.

1013
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:45,750
- Shut up a second, will you.
- Go on.

1014
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:49,120
Take me and hang me! I've done my best!

1015
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:13,860
Give me Walter Burns, quick. Right.

1016
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:17,780
Hello. Hello, Peggy.

1017
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:20,490
Listen, have a heart. Something terrific
has happened. Hold the line, dear.

1018
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:23,030
Hello, Walter. Hildy. Come over here
right away. Wait a minute.

1019
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:26,750
Listen, Peggy. Don't bawl me out.
I'm in a terrible jam. Hold the line, dear.

1020
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:29,710
Walter. Get this. I can only say this once.
I just captured Earl Williams.

1021
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:33,460
Yeah, here in the press room. What?
Honest to... Come over here. I need you.

1022
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:36,500
Now, listen, dear, don't start to cry
or I can't tell you. Get this.

1023
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:39,420
I just captured Earl
Williams, the murderer.

1024
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:42,010
Please don't tell anybody.
I know, but I can't ̶

1025
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:45,010
Don't you realize this is the greatest
thing that's ever happened in my life?

1026
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,060
Dear, listen! Honey, pl...

1027
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,770
Wait a minute, Molly!

1028
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:52,270
They got him surrounded someplace.
Gonna shoot him like a dog.

1029
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,690
If you're smart, you'll get outta here.
They're looking for you too.

1030
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:57,320
Tell me where they've gone. I ain't
afraid of them, the yellow murderers.

1031
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,650
Lincoln. Lincoln and First.

1032
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,110
Well, for...

1033
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,200
Shh.

1034
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,490
- Who is it?
- It's me. I got a clue.

1035
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:07,990
I'll be right with you, Woodenshoes.
Get back in there.

1036
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,330
- What is this, a double-cross?
- I'm trying to save him.

1037
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:12,790
- This is very important.
- It's a cop.

1038
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,880
Keep him quiet. I'll get rid of him.

1039
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,000
Hello, Woodenshoes.

1040
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:21,050
- Thank you for the roses, Molly.
- How'd you get here?

1041
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:25,600
I came down the rain pipe. I didn't mean
to shoot him. I don't know what happened.

1042
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,850
But you can't stay here. They'll get you.

1043
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:30,140
I don't care anymore.

1044
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:32,140
Well, you've gotta hide.

1045
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:34,980
- The rats.
- No. Don't do anything.

1046
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:37,730
I'm ready to go. I don't care.

1047
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:44,780
It's better to die for a cause than
the way most people die, for no reason.

1048
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:46,660
You won't die.

1049
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:48,330
They'll never get you.

1050
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:52,330
I ain't important.

1051
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:54,330
It's humanity that's important.

1052
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:58,040
Like I told you, Molly,
humanity is a wonderful thing.

1053
00:59:58,130 --> 00:59:59,960
No, it ain't.

1054
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:02,510
They're just dirty murderers.

1055
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:05,640
Look what they've done to you. And to me.

1056
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,350
That's... That's because
they don't know any better.

1057
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:10,680
You're too good for 'em, that's why.

1058
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:15,900
You're good too.

1059
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:18,520
- Me?
- Yeah.

1060
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:20,690
I think you're wonderful.

1061
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:23,530
I made out a statement today
and left it with the warden

1062
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:26,990
so that when I was dead
people would understand what I meant.

1063
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:29,370
There was a lot about you in it.

1064
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:33,910
I said you were the most
beautiful character I ever met.

1065
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,460
Yeah?

1066
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:43,470
So this is the time for you
to print my theory of crime prevention.

1067
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:46,260
Sure. Okay, run along
and write it out for me.

1068
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:49,390
And hurry up, will ya!

1069
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:51,890
- Get back in there. The fellas are coming.
- They'll find him.

1070
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:53,730
There's no place else!

1071
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:56,100
- Shh!
- Who locked the door?

1072
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:57,650
Coming, Mike!

1073
01:00:57,730 --> 01:01:01,110
He's gotta get back in there.
Wait a minute. I got an idea.

1074
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,320
Get in this desk.

1075
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,150
What's going on in there?

1076
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,700
- What good will it do?
- We'll get you out in ten minutes.

1077
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:10,950
Open up in there, will you?

1078
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,580
All right, all right!

1079
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,790
- Go on! Please!
- They'll find me anyway.

1080
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:16,920
I'm coming!

1081
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,920
- Keep quiet. Don't even breathe.
- I'll be right here.

1082
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,710
I won't leave you.

1083
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:26,170
Hey!

1084
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,930
What are you tryin' to do?
Kick down the building?

1085
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:30,760
- Kind of exclusive, ain't you?
- Molly!

1086
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:33,180
- I beg your pardon.
- City desk.

1087
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:35,640
- What's the idea of locking the door?
- I was interviewing her.

1088
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:38,190
- The desk. What was he doing to her?
- With the blinds down!

1089
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:40,650
- You fellas don't understand.
- You still here?

1090
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,650
Boy, some Halloween going on out there.

1091
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:45,070
They got the whole police department
standing on their ear.

1092
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:46,820
Hello, Murphy calling. Give me the desk.

1093
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:49,410
- Any news?
- I never was so tired in my life.

1094
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:51,490
They surrounded the house,
but Williams wasn't there.

1095
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:54,950
- No luck on Williams yet. Call you back.
- What a chase! Did you miss your train?

1096
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:59,210
Kruger calling.
I'm out with Sheriff Hartman's deputies.

1097
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:01,630
Yeah, I'm in a drugstore.

1098
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:05,960
Well, call me back if you don't believe me.

1099
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:10,720
Come on. Come on, operator. Fitzroy 2500.

1100
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,640
Molly, can't you flop somewhere else?

1101
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,770
Mmm! Smell.

1102
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,190
Fleur de Floozy.

1103
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,770
Makes me passionate.

1104
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,770
Look out. She'll start bawling again.

1105
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:28,450
- Why don't you let her alone!
- Say, when did you two get so chummy?

1106
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:30,820
Told us he was interviewing her.

1107
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:32,780
- Are you back on the job again?
- Aw...

1108
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:35,700
Hello, Sarge. McCue. Anything doing?

1109
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:38,790
- You still here?
- Trying to hang something on us, if you ask me.

1110
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:41,920
I'm waiting for Walter. Promised to
send a guy over with some dough.

1111
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:45,880
Hey, this looks good, an old lady
just phoned the detective bureau

1112
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,130
and claims Earl Williams
is hiding under her piazza.

1113
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:51,050
Tell her to stand up.

1114
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:54,350
Aw, now, just the same, fellas,
that sounds like a pretty good tip.

1115
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:56,390
Shall we go out after it?

1116
01:02:56,470 --> 01:03:00,100
- Say, I'll cover this end for you.
- Don't let's do any more going out.

1117
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:04,150
- Who pulled the shades down?
- Molly likes it that way.

1118
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:06,860
Hey, I got a hunch Williams ain't
anyplace they been lookin' for him.

1119
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:08,860
- He might be right here in this building.
- Sure!

1120
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:11,950
Hanging around like a duck in
a shooting gallery, I suppose. Bright guys!

1121
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:13,950
Now there's the skylight he got out of.

1122
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:15,950
But how could he get
from there to the ground?

1123
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,240
I'm pretendin'
there ain't no Earl Williams.

1124
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:21,500
Look, he could have jumped over to
this roof, that's only about four feet.

1125
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:25,500
Once he got on this roof, he could slide down
the rain pipe and come in any of the windows.

1126
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:28,420
Well, if the story's going
to walk right in the window...

1127
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:29,920
Well, the masterminds at work.

1128
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:33,220
Why don't all you guys go home?
Williams'll probably call on you.

1129
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:37,680
There must be something to what Ed says,
or they'd have nabbed Williams by now.

1130
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:39,430
The whole city's inside out
looking for him.

1131
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:42,190
Well, if he came in this building,
it's a cinch he's still here.

1132
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:45,360
There hasn't been a chance for a flea
to get through those cops downstairs.

1133
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,980
Unless it's one
that fell off of the sheriff.

1134
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:50,190
What's happened?

1135
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:57,330
You still here, Johnson?

1136
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:59,910
I thought you were going to New York.

1137
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,290
Is that the only place
you can find to sit in?

1138
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:04,290
This chair and this desk are my property,

1139
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:07,290
and I'm not going to have
anybody using them, anybody!

1140
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:09,420
- What are you looking for, Roy?
- I forgot my aspirin.

1141
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:11,510
You don't want to use aspirin.
It's bad for your heart.

1142
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:12,840
- Is it really?
- Yes.

1143
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:14,840
I've felt little palpitations
every time I use it.

1144
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:16,720
- What's the matter, Roy? You sick?
- Sick?

1145
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,180
If I haven't got the drip coming on,
I miss my guess.

1146
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:22,020
Get some Tonsiline.

1147
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,430
- Tonsiline.
- Yep.

1148
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,440
Never heard of it. Is it any good?

1149
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,440
It's great.
It broke my cold up in five minutes.

1150
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,440
- Five mi... Five minutes?
- Five minutes!

1151
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:30,820
- What's the name?
- Tonsiline.

1152
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,360
"T" for taffy, "O" for ox, "N" for... nuts.
Get the Tonsiline.

1153
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:34,950
I know how to spell it.

1154
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:36,320
- Any drugstore?
- Any drugstore.

1155
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:37,870
I'll get me some.

1156
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,240
That drinking cup.

1157
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:54,550
Wish Walter'd get here with my dough.

1158
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:58,390
Hey, speaking about dough, there's
a ten grand reward for this guy Williams.

1159
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:00,850
Let's get the cops and search the building.
What do you say?

1160
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:03,180
Wouldn't it be funny
if we found him here in the building?

1161
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:06,810
Supposing he is here in the building. The cops
would grab the reward. We wouldn't get a smell.

1162
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:08,810
- That's right.
- We'll all grab a floor!

1163
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:11,070
Whoever gets him, we split the reward.

1164
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:12,730
I'll stay here.

1165
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:17,410
I don't know about that.
Getting my sunset blown off.

1166
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:20,160
Well, what else is it good for?
Besides, he can't hurt anybody.

1167
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,950
Aw, come on, Mac.

1168
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:25,960
Well!

1169
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:30,130
- Hello, Mother.
- Don't you "Mother" me.

1170
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:34,420
If you've got anything to say for yourself after
keeping us at that station all this time,

1171
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:36,420
you come downstairs and say it to Peggy.

1172
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:38,430
- Tell Peggy I'll be there in five minutes.
- No, sir.

1173
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:41,050
- I don't move out of here without you.
- But I told Peggy ̶

1174
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:44,600
I know.
Some gibberish about a murderer.

1175
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:46,520
N-No, I ̶

1176
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,520
I don't care if you did catch him.
You come with me this minute.

1177
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:52,230
- I knew something stunk around here.
- Who says he caught him?

1178
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:55,070
- What do you mean, he caught a murderer?
- I didn't say anything of the kind!

1179
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:57,070
- Yes, you did!
- He never told her that!

1180
01:05:57,150 --> 01:06:00,070
No, I said I was trying to save him.
You see, Mother? You got it balled up.

1181
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,160
- How do you know he didn't?
- Let go!

1182
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,040
Hildy and she were here together.

1183
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:06,160
Yeah!

1184
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:09,120
- She's the one that knows.
- What do you mean?

1185
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:11,790
Cherchez la femme!

1186
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:16,170
- Where's Earl Williams?
- How should I know?

1187
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:18,090
Where is he?

1188
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:20,930
Who you holding out on?
Come clean before we knock it out of you.

1189
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:22,930
- Sock him, Jimmy!
- Who you tryin' to cross?

1190
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:25,520
Wait, you stool pigeons!

1191
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:29,230
He doesn't know where Williams is.
I'm the one that knows.

1192
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:32,860
- What do you mean, you know?
- Go find out, you heels.

1193
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:34,480
You don't think I'm gonna tell!

1194
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:37,440
- We'll make you.
- Let her alone. She's goofy.

1195
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:40,530
She ain't too goofy
to know where Williams is.

1196
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:45,450
- Look out! Close that door!
- No, you're not gettin' out of here.

1197
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:49,160
- Now, where is he?
- Where you hiding him?

1198
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:51,580
I ain't gonna squeal! I ain't gonna!

1199
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:53,420
You gotta tell,
or we'll shake it out of ya.

1200
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,630
Wanna have us call the cops
and give you the boot?

1201
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:57,630
Come on, Woodenshoes. Slap it out of her.

1202
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:00,050
Where is he? Before I hurt ya!

1203
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:02,140
Don't you come near me, you kidney foot!

1204
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:05,510
Keep away. Keep away from me!
I'll knock your heads off!

1205
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,140
- Put down that chair!
- Get around! Get on the side of her!

1206
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:09,810
No, you don't!
You'll never get it out of me!

1207
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:11,390
I'll never tell! Never!

1208
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,480
Grab her!

1209
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:17,820
- Take me out.
- Carl, Carl! Get a stretcher!

1210
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,650
- She's moving. She's alive.
- Stand back there. Don't touch her.

1211
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:23,160
- Get the cops, Woodenshoes.
- Come on, fellas.

1212
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,990
- What is it?
- Aw, gee, the poor kid.

1213
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:28,490
- What happened?
- Fell out a window.

1214
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:31,460
She's breathing! Give her air!

1215
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:34,130
- Walter, did you see that?
- Yes. Where is he?

1216
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:36,790
- She jumped out of the window.
- I know. Where is he, I said?

1217
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,050
- Anyway, she ain't dead.
- Come to, Hildy.

1218
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:40,590
- Where have you got Williams?
- What?

1219
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:42,970
He's in the desk. That poor kid.

1220
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:47,010
- Let me out! I can't stand it!
- Keep quiet. You're sitting pretty.

1221
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,430
- What's the matter?
- Get back!

1222
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:49,770
- That's my girl's mother!
- What are you doing?

1223
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:52,190
- Shut up!
- I won't shut up. That girl killed herself.

1224
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:54,810
You're doing something wrong.
What's in there?

1225
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,610
Louie, take this lady over
to Polack Mike's and lock her up.

1226
01:07:57,690 --> 01:07:59,610
And see that she doesn't
talk to anyone on the way.

1227
01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:01,610
- What's that? What's that?
- Take her out the back way.

1228
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:04,610
- Tell Mike it's a case of delirium tremens.
- Walter, this'll get me in a terrible jam.

1229
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:08,490
- Sure. Anything you say, boss.
- Don't worry, Mother! This is only temporary!

1230
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,120
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm gonna get my girl!

1231
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:15,460
Your girl. What are you,
some puling college boy?

1232
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:17,960
Why, in time of war you could be shot
for what you're doing! For less!

1233
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:19,960
Screw! There's your story!
Smear it all over the front page!

1234
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:22,720
Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post!
And take all the credit!

1235
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,090
I covered your story,
and now I'm getting out!

1236
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:27,510
Why, you drooling saphead!
What do you mean, a story?

1237
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,430
- You've got the city by the seat of the pants!
- I know, but ̶

1238
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,310
You know.
You've got the brain of a pancake.

1239
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:35,560
Listen, if I didn't have your interest at heart,
would I be wasting time arguing with you now?

1240
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:37,810
You've done something big.
You've stepped into a new class!

1241
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:39,730
We'll make such monkeys
out of those ward heelers

1242
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:41,650
that nobody'll vote for them,
not even their wives!

1243
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:43,400
- Expose 'em, huh?
- Crucify 'em.

1244
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:46,410
We're gonna keep Williams under cover
so the Post can break the story exclusive.

1245
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:49,200
Then we'll let the governor in on the
capture and share the glory with him.

1246
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:51,830
- I see. I see!
- You've kicked over city hall like an applecart.

1247
01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:53,830
You've got the mayor and Hartman
against a wall.

1248
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:55,830
You've put one administration out
and another one in.

1249
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,830
This isn't a newspaper
story, it's a career!

1250
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,840
And you stand there
bellyaching about some girl.

1251
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,840
Well, I wasn't thinkin'
about it that way, I guess.

1252
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,170
- We'll be the white-haired boys, won't we?
- Why, they'll be naming streets after you.

1253
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:06,680
Johnson Street!

1254
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,850
You and I and the governor
are gonna run this town.

1255
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:11,260
- But we can't keep Williams here.
- I'm gonna take him over to my private office.

1256
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:13,270
- Which is our phone?
- That one. How? They'll see him.

1257
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:16,100
- Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry it.
- You can't! It's swarming with cops outside!

1258
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:19,060
We'll lower it out of the window with
pulleys. Hildy, start pounding out a lead!

1259
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:20,770
- How much do you want on it?
- All the words you've got.

1260
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:22,530
- Where's some paper?
- Give me Duffy!

1261
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:24,240
Hello!

1262
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:27,110
- Can I call the mayor an animal at bay?
- Call him a love-child if you want. Duffy!

1263
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,490
How about the time he had
his house painted by firemen?

1264
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:31,490
Give him the works! Hello, Duffy.

1265
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:34,250
Get set. We've got
the biggest story in the world.

1266
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:36,500
Earl Williams caught
by the Post. Exclusive.

1267
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:38,250
Sent word down to Butch McGuirk.

1268
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:42,250
I want ten huskies to lam right over here ̶
press room, criminal courts building.

1269
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:45,420
Butch'll get that desk out.
Nothing's ever stopped those boys.

1270
01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:47,300
- What if they start shooting?
- Fine.

1271
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:51,140
Now, listen, Duffy, I want you
to tear out the whole front page.

1272
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:54,560
That's what I said ̶
the whole front page, out.

1273
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,140
Johnson's writing the lead.

1274
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:58,730
- Hildy!
- What the devil do you want?

1275
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:02,320
- Hildy!
- Stick the Chinese earthquake.

1276
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:05,990
Miss, you can't come in here. Wait a
minute, Duffy. Look here, little girl.

1277
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:09,360
You're doing this to him.
He was going and you stopped him.

1278
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:11,410
Now, listen, dear.
Something terrific has happened.

1279
01:10:11,490 --> 01:10:14,700
- I was going to tell you, but I couldn't.
- Tell her nothing! She's a woman, you fool!

1280
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:17,120
- I'm not going to let you do it.
- Holy jumping ̶

1281
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:19,790
- This is the biggest chance of my life.
- Keep quiet!

1282
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,080
- You don't want to marry me, that's all.
- That isn't true.

1283
01:10:22,170 --> 01:10:26,460
You won't listen. You say I don't love you. You
know I'd do anything in the world for you.

1284
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:28,340
Junk the League of Nations! Spike it!

1285
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:31,430
You never intended to be decent
and live like a human being.

1286
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:34,100
- You were lying all the time.
- All right then, if that's what you think.

1287
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:36,720
H. Sebastian jumping ̶
I'm trying to concentrate!

1288
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:39,890
I see what you are now.
Just a bum, like him.

1289
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:41,600
Sure, that's what I am!

1290
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:44,320
No, leave the rooster story alone ̶
that's human interest.

1291
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:47,690
You're just a heartless, selfish animal
without any feelings.

1292
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:50,030
- It's all your fault.
- Shut up, will you?

1293
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:52,660
- Let me talk to Butch.
- That's what I am... a bum without any feelings.

1294
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:56,120
- That's all I ever want to be.
- Then get hold of Butch as fast as you can!

1295
01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:00,250
You never did love me,
or you couldn't talk to me that way.

1296
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:06,090
If you want me, take me as I am instead of
trying to make a floozy out of me.

1297
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:08,420
I'm no stuffed-shirt writing peanut ads.
I'm a newspaper man!

1298
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:10,420
Let it come, kid, fast.

1299
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,930
Get back in there, you mock turtle!

1300
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:16,310
Hello, Duffy? The edition gone in yet?

1301
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:18,390
Well, don't! Never mind the mail trains!

1302
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,390
You're not working for the advertising
department! Keep on this wire!

1303
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,230
Aw, nuts!

1304
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:38,540
Let me go. Let me out of here!

1305
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,210
Duffy. Duffy!

1306
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:46,380
I told him to stay on this phone.

1307
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:50,170
Now the moon is out.

1308
01:11:56,890 --> 01:11:59,600
Fine. Three taps is me. Don't forget.

1309
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:02,440
You're sitting pretty now. Got enough air?

1310
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:03,560
That better?

1311
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:06,110
Lam into 'em, Hildy.
Every punch below the belt.

1312
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:08,230
Hello? Duffy, where have you been?

1313
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:11,150
Never mind your diabetes!
Keep on this phone!

1314
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:14,780
Listen, did you impress it on Butch
to take a taxi, that every minute counts?

1315
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:16,620
You did? All right.

1316
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,620
- Duffy's getting old.
- Where is Butch?

1317
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:21,330
- He's on the way.
- Better hurry. The fellas'll be coming back.

1318
01:12:29,210 --> 01:12:31,380
How is she?

1319
01:12:31,470 --> 01:12:33,170
Don't know yet.

1320
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,090
What's your lead, Hildy?

1321
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:39,930
"While hundreds of Sheriff Hartman's
paid gunmen stalked through the city,

1322
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,390
shooting innocent bystanders,
spreading their reign of terror,

1323
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:46,150
- Earl Williams was lurking less than 20 yards..."
- No. That stinks.

1324
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:49,150
Aren't you going to mention the Post?
Don't we take any credit?

1325
01:12:49,230 --> 01:12:52,650
- I got that in the second paragraph.
- Who's going to read the second paragraph?

1326
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:55,200
Fifteen years I've been telling you
how to write a newspaper story.

1327
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,740
Have I gotta do everything?
Get the story? Write the story?

1328
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:00,910
Listen, you crazy baboon. I can sneeze
better newspaper stories than you can write!

1329
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:03,500
You ought to be back chasing pictures.
You were good at that.

1330
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:06,330
You ungrateful windbag. Who wrote the
Fitzgerald confession? Ruth Randall's diary?

1331
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:08,960
How about the Dayton flood?
Even the telegraph operator was crying.

1332
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,590
Make me cry now.

1333
01:13:10,670 --> 01:13:14,260
Duffy, what's the name of that religious editor
of ours? The fellow with the dirty collar?

1334
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:17,380
Sipper-what? Well, tell Sipperly
I want to see him right away.

1335
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:20,510
- You know what I'm gonna do?
- Yeah. Talk yourself to death.

1336
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,100
Yes.

1337
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:24,810
I'm going to get Sipperly
to make up a prayer for our fair city

1338
01:13:24,890 --> 01:13:28,190
in eight-column, Old English boldface,
right across the top of the paper.

1339
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:32,570
"Our Father, there were 421 murders
in this, our fair city, last year."

1340
01:13:32,650 --> 01:13:34,400
All in religious lingo, see?

1341
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:36,070
"Our Father."

1342
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:38,070
What a prayer.

1343
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,530
- What an idea.
- Mm-hmm.

1344
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:42,740
You better pray that desk
will float over to your office.

1345
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:45,700
Wait. Wait, wait. I've got an inspiration.

1346
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,420
Here's your lead.
Take this down just as I say it.

1347
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:52,170
Someday you're gonna do that
and I'm gonna belt you in the jaw.

1348
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:55,340
The Post again rode to the rescue of the city
last night in the darkest hour of her history.

1349
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:57,340
Earl Williams ̶
Earl Williams, the Bolshevik Tiger,

1350
01:13:57,430 --> 01:14:00,340
who leapt snarling from the gallows
upon the flanks of the city, was captured ̶

1351
01:14:00,430 --> 01:14:01,850
- I gotcha, I gotcha!
- Go on from there.

1352
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:05,680
- Who's that?
- Who's that?

1353
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:07,770
What's the idea in locking this door?

1354
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:09,520
That's Bensinger.
That's his desk.

1355
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,900
- What's his name?
- Bensinger, of the Tribune.

1356
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,280
- I'll handle him. The Tribune, eh?
- Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1357
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:19,160
What's the idea of locking that door?
Haven't you any better sense?

1358
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:21,320
This isn't a private office
and you ought to know better.

1359
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:23,530
Mr. Burns.

1360
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:26,540
- It's quite an honor having you over here.
- Hello, Bensinger.

1361
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:28,540
If you'll excuse me, please ̶

1362
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:31,040
Quite a coincidence, my running
into you tonight. Isn't it, Hildy?

1363
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:32,670
- Yeah.
- Well, how do you mean?

1364
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:36,260
I was just having a little chat about you
this afternoon. That's nice.

1365
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:38,550
- With our Mr. Duffy.
- Really.

1366
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:40,800
- Nothing detrimental, I hope.
- Well, I should say not.

1367
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:43,350
That was one swell story
you had in the paper this morning.

1368
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:45,350
Did you like that, Mr. Burns?
Well ̶

1369
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:47,350
- Did you like the poem?
- The poem?

1370
01:14:47,430 --> 01:14:49,310
- The poem was great.
- Wasn't it? Wasn't it?

1371
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:50,770
Especially that ending.

1372
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:52,770
"And all is well outside his cell,

1373
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:55,980
but in his heart he hears
the hangman calling and the gallows falling

1374
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:58,360
and his white-haired mother's tears."

1375
01:14:58,450 --> 01:14:59,900
- Heartbreaking.
- Isn't it?

1376
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:02,320
- How would you like to work for me?
- Well ̶

1377
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:04,330
- What?
- We need somebody like you.

1378
01:15:04,410 --> 01:15:07,330
All we've got now are a lot of lowbrows
and legmen. Like Johnson here.

1379
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:10,000
Are you serious, Mr. Burns?

1380
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,870
My dear Bensinger.

1381
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:15,960
Duffy, I'm sending Bensinger
over to see you.

1382
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:18,090
- Mervyn, isn't it?
- Roy. Roy V.

1383
01:15:18,170 --> 01:15:21,510
Of course. Roy Bensinger, the poet.
Put him right on the staff.

1384
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:23,840
- What are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
- Seventy-five.

1385
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:25,850
I'll give you a hundred and a byline.

1386
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:27,470
Give him everything he wants.

1387
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,230
- Now hustle.
- Yes, sir.

1388
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:32,350
And write me a story from the point of view
of the escaped man.

1389
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:36,020
He hides, cowering,
afraid of every light, of every sound.

1390
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:38,570
He hears footsteps,
his heart going like that.

1391
01:15:38,650 --> 01:15:40,690
And all the time they're closing in.

1392
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:42,950
Get the sense of an animal at bay.

1393
01:15:44,370 --> 01:15:46,870
Sort of a Jack London style?

1394
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:48,540
- Exactly!
- Yes, sir.

1395
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:51,160
Excuse me. I just want to
get my rhyming dictionary.

1396
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:53,580
- It doesn't have to rhyme.
- Of course.

1397
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:57,670
I can't tell you, Mr. Burns,
how terribly grateful I am, yes, sir.

1398
01:15:57,750 --> 01:16:00,920
You don't suppose there might be an opening
sometime for a foreign correspondent?

1399
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:02,930
I parlez-vous a little French, you know.

1400
01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:05,050
- I'll keep you in mind, Roy.
- Thank you, sir ̶

1401
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:07,930
Thank you. Yes, sir.

1402
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:11,560
- Au revoir, mon capitaine.
- "Bon-jower".

1403
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:15,480
No. Oh, "jower". Yes.

1404
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:19,650
"White-haired mother's tears."

1405
01:16:19,730 --> 01:16:21,320
Duffy, get this.

1406
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,650
A Tribune sneak is coming over
to get a job.

1407
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:26,280
Bensinger. The fellow I told you about.

1408
01:16:26,370 --> 01:16:28,240
Tell him to keep busy writing poetry.

1409
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:31,250
No, we don't want him. Handle him
with kid gloves till he gets through.

1410
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:34,330
Then tell him his poetry stinks
and kick him downstairs.

1411
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:37,130
Well, you double-crossing rat.

1412
01:16:37,210 --> 01:16:40,210
That will teach him not to quit his job
without giving notice.

1413
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:44,800
Taxi! Taxi!

1414
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:48,260
The Morning Post building, quickly!

1415
01:16:49,850 --> 01:16:52,640
I... I beg your pardon.

1416
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:55,810
Taxi!

1417
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:57,810
Tear into it!
Don't stare like a frozen robin!

1418
01:16:57,900 --> 01:17:00,610
You've just jazzed up my whole life.
That's what you've done.

1419
01:17:00,690 --> 01:17:03,070
We oughta have our plans set
when Butch gets here.

1420
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:05,490
Butch. He'd go through fire for me.

1421
01:17:05,570 --> 01:17:07,780
Fine horse's bustle I turned out to be.

1422
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:09,700
No, the window's out.

1423
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:11,910
We'll have them carry it
out of the building.

1424
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,460
Gee, she was the most
wonderful girl I'll ever know.

1425
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:17,210
She had looks, brains, spirit, everything.

1426
01:17:17,290 --> 01:17:19,670
- Who are you talking about?
- My girl! What do you think?

1427
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:22,840
Mumbling about your girl now?
You've got a story to write!

1428
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:25,340
Practically chased her out
like she was some pick-up.

1429
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:28,010
You acted like a man
for the first time in your life.

1430
01:17:28,090 --> 01:17:30,300
I'll never love anybody else.

1431
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:32,770
They don't come twice like that
in a man's life.

1432
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:34,890
You'll sleep it off.

1433
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:37,480
Gee, when she was sick in the hospital,

1434
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:40,690
and you sent me on that
wild goose chase all over Kentucky,

1435
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:42,110
she never even complained.

1436
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:44,990
- Sick in the hospital.
- Well, she was! She nearly died!

1437
01:17:45,070 --> 01:17:48,160
I see. She never complained.
She just nearly died.

1438
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:52,370
Gee, this time tomorrow I'd have
been on the train on my way to New York.

1439
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:53,740
Hildy.

1440
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:57,040
I was in love once.

1441
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:58,710
With my third wife.

1442
01:17:58,790 --> 01:18:02,800
I treated her white. Let her have a maid
and everything. I was sweet to her.

1443
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,920
- Who wants to hear about your wife?
- I trusted her.

1444
01:18:06,010 --> 01:18:09,130
Then I let her meet a certain party
on the Tribune, and what happened?

1445
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:11,430
One night I came home unexpectedly.

1446
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:14,600
I let myself in through
the bedroom window.

1447
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:16,100
End of story.

1448
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:18,100
I don't want to hear about your troubles.

1449
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:21,730
And the very next morning, what do I find
in the Tribune all over the front page?

1450
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:24,400
My traction story that I'd been
fool enough to tell my wife.

1451
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,150
Yeah, you know a lot about women.
You and that stable you keep.

1452
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:30,490
You never met a decent woman. You wouldn't
know what to do with a pure girl.

1453
01:18:30,570 --> 01:18:31,870
Yes, I would.

1454
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:33,620
You take that back!

1455
01:18:34,330 --> 01:18:36,540
What do you think women are? Flowers?

1456
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:39,670
Now, take that dame that shot
the dentist, Mrs. Vermilyea.

1457
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:43,290
Husband comes home, all worn out, hungry.
Takes a spoonful of soup, falls dead.

1458
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:44,550
Arsenic.

1459
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:47,710
And Mrs. Petras,
burning her husband up in a furnace.

1460
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:52,220
If you'd been in this business as long as I
have, you'd know what women are, murderers!

1461
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:53,510
Borgias!

1462
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:59,600
Boy, I'm a sap,
falling for your line of...

1463
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:05,150
Johnson Street!

1464
01:19:05,230 --> 01:19:08,280
You've had a good rest. Get back
on the story. Here. You're just nervous.

1465
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:11,530
Sure, I'll take that. I'll get stewed tonight,
and I'll stay stewed the rest of my life.

1466
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:14,410
I'll be a newspaperman
right in your class.

1467
01:19:14,490 --> 01:19:16,450
Got my bustle in a monkey cage.

1468
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:18,410
Shut up, you fathead.

1469
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,540
- Who is it?
- Hello, boss.

1470
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:21,830
It's Louie.

1471
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,250
- What's the matter?
- Where's the old lady?

1472
01:19:23,330 --> 01:19:24,330
- What'd you do with her?
- What happened?

1473
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:26,210
- You been in a fight?
- Down on Western Avenue.

1474
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,710
- We was going 65 miles an hour.
- Take that mush out of your mouth!

1475
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,420
- Where's the old lady?
- I'm-a telling you!

1476
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:34,430
We run smack into a police patrol.
You know what I mean? We cut him in half.

1477
01:19:34,510 --> 01:19:36,100
- Was she hurt?
- Tell me. Where is she?

1478
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:39,560
I'm-a telling you. Can you imagine
bumping a load of cops?

1479
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:41,560
They come rollin' out
like they were oranges!

1480
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:43,560
- What did you do with her?
- Search me.

1481
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:46,150
When I come to,
I was running down 35th Street.

1482
01:19:46,230 --> 01:19:49,610
- You were with her in the cab, weren't you?
- Yeah, was I.

1483
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:51,990
The taxi driver, he got knocked cold.

1484
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:55,990
Butterfingers. I give you an old lady to take
somewhere and you hand her over to the cops!

1485
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,780
What do you mean, I hand?

1486
01:19:57,870 --> 01:20:01,410
The police patrol was on the wrong side
of the street, and there you got it.

1487
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:05,420
And now everything's fine. She's probably
squawking her head off in some police station.

1488
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,420
I don't think she's talking much.
You know what I mean?

1489
01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:12,300
- Don't tell me. Was she killed?
- Was she? Did you notice?

1490
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:17,100
Say, with that rap what I got against me and
the bank job and the big blow right here,

1491
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:20,140
I should stick around asking
questions from a lot of cops?

1492
01:20:20,230 --> 01:20:21,810
Sure.

1493
01:20:23,770 --> 01:20:25,190
Dead.

1494
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:28,610
Well, that finishes me.

1495
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:30,230
That's fate, Hildy.

1496
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,860
What will be, will be.

1497
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:34,740
Sure.

1498
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:36,740
But what am I gonna tell Peggy?

1499
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:39,160
- What am I gonna say to her?
- You'll never see her again.

1500
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:42,540
Snap out of it. Would you rather have the old
lady bringing the whole police force here?

1501
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:45,920
But I killed her. I did it. What am I
gonna do? How am I ever gonna face her?

1502
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,330
Look at you. Look at me!

1503
01:20:47,420 --> 01:20:49,340
I'm looking at you, you murderer!

1504
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:52,340
If it was my own mother I'd carry on.
You know I would. For the paper.

1505
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:55,260
- Where did it happen? I'm going out.
- Wait here. I'll find out if everything's all right.

1506
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:56,680
Western and 34th.

1507
01:20:57,550 --> 01:20:58,550
Hello. Hello.

1508
01:21:01,770 --> 01:21:03,600
Give me Western 4557.

1509
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:04,850
Who?

1510
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:06,690
Hello, Butch. Where are you?

1511
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:08,730
Hello, Mission Hospital?

1512
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:11,190
What are you doing there?
Haven't you even started?

1513
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,570
Was an old lady brought in
from an auto smashup?

1514
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:17,780
For H. Sebastian. Butch, listen,
it's a matter of life and death.

1515
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:19,160
Nobody?

1516
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,660
I can't hear.

1517
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:24,750
Who? Speak up!

1518
01:21:24,830 --> 01:21:26,830
You got what?

1519
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:28,830
You can't stop for a dame now.

1520
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,460
Hello, Community Hospital?

1521
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:32,800
I don't care if you've been
trying for six years.

1522
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,800
Butch, our whole lives are at stake.

1523
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,180
You're not gonna let some
round-heeled blonde ruin everything?

1524
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:39,430
Eddie, this is Hildy Johnson.

1525
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:41,970
Butch, I'd put my arm in fire for you.

1526
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:43,430
Up to here!

1527
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,430
Now, you can't double-cross me!

1528
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:49,190
She does?
All right, put her on. I'll talk to her.

1529
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:50,650
Hello.

1530
01:21:50,730 --> 01:21:52,150
Hello, madam.

1531
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:55,530
Now, listen, tramp.
You can't keep Butch away from his duty.

1532
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:58,110
What kind of language is that?

1533
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,240
Hello. Hello!

1534
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:04,240
I'll kill 'em. I'll kill both of them.

1535
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:10,750
Duffy! Mousing around with some
big blonde Annie when I need him.

1536
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:12,380
That's cooperation.

1537
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,090
- Duffy!
- Shut up, will you?

1538
01:22:14,170 --> 01:22:16,880
- Are you sure? Nobody?
- Duffy!

1539
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:21,260
Diabetes. I oughta know better
than to hire anybody with a disease.

1540
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:22,600
- Louie.
- Sì?

1541
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,350
- It's up to you.
- Anything you want, boss.

1542
01:22:24,430 --> 01:22:27,140
- Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
- Who do you want I should get?

1543
01:22:27,230 --> 01:22:29,140
Anybody with hair on their chest.

1544
01:22:29,230 --> 01:22:31,360
Get 'em off the street. Anywhere.
Offer them anything. Only get 'em.

1545
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,360
We gotta get that desk out of here.

1546
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,360
Boss, the shirt off my back.
You know what I mean?

1547
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:38,360
Don't bump into anything.

1548
01:22:38,450 --> 01:22:40,570
Lafayette 2100.

1549
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:43,160
That dumb immigrant'll flop on me.
I know it.

1550
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:46,830
Can you imagine Butch laying down
at a time like this?

1551
01:22:48,790 --> 01:22:51,080
Come on, let's go back to the press room.

1552
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,010
Yeah.
Ed, tell them to give us a ring there.

1553
01:22:58,090 --> 01:23:00,340
Yeah, tell 'em to ring us
at the press room.

1554
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:03,850
Ring us at the press room.

1555
01:23:08,310 --> 01:23:10,850
If Louie don't get back in five minutes,
we'll get it out alone.

1556
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:12,190
There are millions of ways.

1557
01:23:12,270 --> 01:23:15,150
We'll start a fire and the firemen
can carry it out in the confusion.

1558
01:23:15,230 --> 01:23:17,900
Ring that number, will ya!

1559
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:20,240
Come here. See if we can move it.

1560
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:25,120
Hello. Is this the lying-in hospital?
Did you have an auto smashup in the last ̶

1561
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,740
Will you come here?

1562
01:23:26,830 --> 01:23:28,580
Well, I beg your pardon.

1563
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:32,460
When I'm surrounded, with my back against
the wall, you're not gonna lay down on me.

1564
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:35,380
I'm going to lay down on you
and spit in your eye, you murderer!

1565
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:36,750
Yellow, uh?

1566
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:42,090
I don't care what you think I am.
I'm going out and find my girl's mother.

1567
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:43,890
You and Butch McGuirk, woman lovers!

1568
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:46,930
Don't open that!

1569
01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:48,810
- There he is.
- Say, say, Hildy.

1570
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:50,520
Just a minute, Johnson!

1571
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:52,600
- Let go of me. What's the idea?
- What's your hurry?

1572
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:55,190
- Wait a minute. We wanna see you.
- Keep your paws off me!

1573
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:57,940
- Hold him, boys.
- Wait a minute, Hartman, wait a minute.

1574
01:23:59,490 --> 01:24:01,820
Who do you think you are,
breaking in here like this?

1575
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:03,450
You can't bluff me, Burns.

1576
01:24:03,530 --> 01:24:05,990
I don't care who you are
or what paper you're editor of.

1577
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:08,830
Let me go. Fellas, something's
happened to my girl's mother.

1578
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:10,660
Hang on to him, boys.

1579
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:13,120
- We know what you're up to.
- Probably goin' out to get Williams.

1580
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:15,130
- The door was locked.
- He and Molly were talking.

1581
01:24:15,210 --> 01:24:17,380
I don't know anything!
There's been an accident!

1582
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:20,550
Johnson, there's something
very, very peculiar going on here.

1583
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:23,130
You can send somebody with me
if you don't believe me.

1584
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:24,760
I wasn't born yesterday.

1585
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:27,180
Now, the boys tell me
that you and this Molly Malloy...

1586
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:30,600
Nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I'm
gonna get outta here and you can't stop me.

1587
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:34,350
Wait a minute. You ain't gonna get anywhere.
He's got the story sewed up, and that's why...

1588
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:37,440
- That's why Burnsie's here.
- We're on to you. Let us in on it.

1589
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:41,360
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman,
make them in the proper manner.

1590
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,860
Otherwise I'll have to ask you to get out.

1591
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:48,200
You'll ask me to what?

1592
01:24:49,290 --> 01:24:50,950
Get out.

1593
01:24:53,870 --> 01:24:57,000
Close that door.
Don't let anybody in or out.

1594
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:01,090
- Sheriff, give him a little third degree.
- Make him talk, Pinky, and you've got Williams.

1595
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:04,300
Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this.

1596
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:07,390
Tell me. What do you know about Williams?

1597
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:10,220
Are you gonna talk or ain't you?

1598
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:13,520
- What do I know about Williams?
- All right, boys. Take him along.

1599
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,270
- I got ways to make him talk.
- Look out, you!

1600
01:25:16,350 --> 01:25:18,940
- What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
- Look out! He's got a gun!

1601
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:26,280
Give me that.

1602
01:25:33,410 --> 01:25:35,750
- Where'd you get this?
- Got a right to carry a gun.

1603
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:37,750
- Not this gun.
- I can explain that.

1604
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:40,750
He was having trouble on the Sprague case.
I gave it to him to defend himself.

1605
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,510
You did, eh?
Well, that's very, very interesting.

1606
01:25:43,590 --> 01:25:47,090
This happens to be the gun
that Earl Williams shot his way out with.

1607
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:49,010
Getting married, huh?

1608
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:51,390
Maybe Williams was gonna be his best man.

1609
01:25:51,470 --> 01:25:54,100
That's pretty, Hildy.
Crossing your own pals.

1610
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:57,310
- What do you know about that?
- Are you trying to make me out a liar?

1611
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,900
I know my own gun, don't I?

1612
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:02,900
We might have known
who'd give Williams a gun.

1613
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:04,690
Don't you ever make a mistake?

1614
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:07,070
Now we're getting the story.

1615
01:26:07,150 --> 01:26:10,570
Then Hildy must have gotten
that gun from Earl Williams.

1616
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:14,660
- Where is he? Where have you got him?
- You're barking up the wrong tree, Pinky.

1617
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:20,830
I'll give you three minutes
to tell me where he is.

1618
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:23,840
He went over to the hospital
to call on Professor Egelhoffer.

1619
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,420
- What?
- With a bag of marshmallows.

1620
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:39,850
Take a magazine along.

1621
01:26:44,230 --> 01:26:47,320
- He ain't there.
- Say, what about Mr. Burns?

1622
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:50,110
Ask the mastermind what he's doing here.

1623
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:53,330
Speak up, Burns.
What do you know about this?

1624
01:26:53,410 --> 01:26:55,370
- My dear Hartman ̶
- Can that.

1625
01:26:55,450 --> 01:26:57,370
Come on. Where is he?

1626
01:26:57,460 --> 01:26:59,870
The Morning Post is not
obstructing justice nor aiding criminals.

1627
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:02,580
- You ought to know that.
- No? Well...

1628
01:27:03,790 --> 01:27:06,630
Johnson, you're under arrest.
You too, Burns.

1629
01:27:06,710 --> 01:27:09,470
Who's under arrest, you insignificant,
pimple-headed, square-toed spy?

1630
01:27:09,550 --> 01:27:11,550
Do you realize what you're doing?

1631
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:13,220
We'll see about that.

1632
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:16,810
Carl, get the mayor on the phone.
Ask him to come over here.

1633
01:27:25,690 --> 01:27:27,400
That man there.

1634
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,570
- Mother, are you all right?
- What's the idea here?

1635
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:35,580
- This lady claims she was kidnapped.
- What?

1636
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:37,950
They dragged me
all the way down the stairs.

1637
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:41,370
Just a minute, lady.
What has this man to do with it?

1638
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:43,920
He was the one in charge of everything.

1639
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,290
He told them to kidnap me.

1640
01:27:47,630 --> 01:27:50,170
Are you referring to me, madam?

1641
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:51,840
You know you did.

1642
01:27:51,930 --> 01:27:54,590
What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?

1643
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:57,470
Well, it's beyond me. Who is this woman?

1644
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:00,310
What a thing to say.

1645
01:28:00,390 --> 01:28:04,190
I was standing right there
when the girl jumped out of the window.

1646
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:06,820
- Did you get the mayor on the phone, Carl?
- Coming right over.

1647
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:08,400
Now, madam, be honest.

1648
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,400
If you were joyriding, drunk
or got into some scrape,

1649
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:14,200
why don't you admit it
instead of accusing innocent people?

1650
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:16,620
You ruffian. You unprincipled man.

1651
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:19,790
You... You... How dare you
say a thing like that?

1652
01:28:19,870 --> 01:28:21,450
Aw, Mother, he's just crazy.

1653
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:24,210
I'll tell you something more.
I'll tell you why they did it.

1654
01:28:24,290 --> 01:28:26,710
- Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail.
- I was in here.

1655
01:28:26,790 --> 01:28:29,670
They had some kind of murderer,
hiding him.

1656
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,970
Hiding him? In here?

1657
01:28:32,050 --> 01:28:33,510
- Hiding him where?
- Mother!

1658
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:37,350
- Where was he? Where'd they have him?
- Madam, you're a cockeyed liar.

1659
01:28:40,350 --> 01:28:42,350
- He's in the desk!
- Holy cats!

1660
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:43,640
- For the love of ̶
- Duffy!

1661
01:28:43,730 --> 01:28:45,230
- Give me that phone!
- What a break!

1662
01:28:45,310 --> 01:28:48,520
I thought so.

1663
01:28:48,610 --> 01:28:50,900
- Stand back, everybody.
- Look out. He may have a gun.

1664
01:28:50,990 --> 01:28:52,740
- Get your guns out.
- He's harmless.

1665
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:55,320
Don't take any chances.
Shoot right through the desk.

1666
01:28:55,410 --> 01:28:58,660
- He can't hurt anybody. You got his gun.
- Dear! Dear!

1667
01:28:58,740 --> 01:29:00,790
- Gray-haired old Judas.
- City desk! Quick!

1668
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:03,040
- Close that door.
- Give me the desk.

1669
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,000
- Guard those windows.
- City desk. Hurry.

1670
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:08,210
- You stand over there.
- Hey! Look out where you're pointin' that gun!

1671
01:29:08,290 --> 01:29:10,090
Give me Emil!

1672
01:29:10,170 --> 01:29:12,010
- Hildy, call Duffy!
- Duffy!

1673
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:14,130
- No, you don't.
- Let me have the desk! Quick!

1674
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:16,380
- You want to get us scooped?
- Now, then, everybody.

1675
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:17,970
Hold the wire. I've got a flash for you.

1676
01:29:18,050 --> 01:29:20,560
- Aim right at the center.
- That's murder!

1677
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:22,970
When I say three...

1678
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:25,310
- Hang on for a second.
- Carl. Frank.

1679
01:29:25,390 --> 01:29:28,400
- Hold it.
- One of you stand each side of the desk.

1680
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:32,030
- Something coming up.
- Take hold of the cover.

1681
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:33,230
Hold the phone.

1682
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:36,450
Now then, we got you covered, Williams.

1683
01:29:36,530 --> 01:29:37,860
I'll have it in a minute.

1684
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:40,160
Ready for an emergency.

1685
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:42,450
Right away now.

1686
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:45,370
- When I say three...
- Something hot!

1687
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,960
One.

1688
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:51,840
Two.

1689
01:29:56,050 --> 01:29:57,840
Up with it!

1690
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:02,180
Go on. Shoot me!

1691
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:05,350
Earl Williams was captured in the press room of
the criminal courts building hiding in a desk.

1692
01:30:05,430 --> 01:30:06,810
Got you, Williams.

1693
01:30:06,890 --> 01:30:09,150
- Williams found in a roll-top.
- Nabbed Williams hiding.

1694
01:30:09,230 --> 01:30:10,230
Found Williams hiding place.

1695
01:30:10,310 --> 01:30:12,570
Williams put up a desperate struggle,
but the police overpowered ̶

1696
01:30:12,650 --> 01:30:15,610
He offered no resistance. He tried to shoot it out
with the cops, but his gun wouldn't work so ̶

1697
01:30:15,690 --> 01:30:16,950
Tried to break through
the cordon of police!

1698
01:30:17,030 --> 01:30:18,610
Williams was unconscious
when they opened the desk.

1699
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:21,870
Hey, Duffy. The Post just turned
Williams over to the sheriff.

1700
01:30:21,950 --> 01:30:25,080
- More in a minute.
- Put the cuffs on those two.

1701
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:28,460
Anonymous note received by the sheriff
led to Williams' capture. More later.

1702
01:30:28,540 --> 01:30:31,170
A well-dressed society woman
tipped off the cops. Call you back.

1703
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:33,290
An old sweetheart of Williams
double-crossed him.

1704
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:35,260
Following a well-defined trail of blood,
the sheriff ̶

1705
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:37,300
Williams gave away his whereabouts
when he sent out for food.

1706
01:30:37,380 --> 01:30:41,260
The sheriff is now tracing a mysterious phone
call that gave away Williams' hiding place.

1707
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:44,560
- Where's the old lady?
- Hey, madam.

1708
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:47,230
- Where'd she go?
- Where is the old dame?

1709
01:30:53,570 --> 01:30:56,230
Hello, girlie. Give me Jacobi, quick.

1710
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,530
Hartman, you're gonna wish
you'd never been born.

1711
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:05,330
Fine work, Pete.
You certainly delivered the goods.

1712
01:31:05,410 --> 01:31:07,330
I'm proud of you.

1713
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:11,790
They look kind of natural,
don't they, eh, Fred?

1714
01:31:12,790 --> 01:31:14,500
A sight for sore eyes.

1715
01:31:14,590 --> 01:31:18,420
Well, it looks like you boys stepped
into something up to your necks.

1716
01:31:18,510 --> 01:31:21,430
Aiding an escaped criminal.

1717
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:24,760
And a little charge of kidnapping
that I'm looking into.

1718
01:31:25,810 --> 01:31:27,770
That's the jail.

1719
01:31:27,850 --> 01:31:29,850
There must be somebody there.

1720
01:31:30,940 --> 01:31:33,480
Hey! There's the old lady now.

1721
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:36,520
Well, it looks like
about ten years apiece for you birds.

1722
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:40,740
Does it? You forget the power that
always watches over the Morning Post.

1723
01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:42,780
Your luck's not with you now.

1724
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:44,700
Jacobi. I caught him.

1725
01:31:44,780 --> 01:31:47,040
Williams. Yeah, single-handed.

1726
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:48,790
I'm bringing him right over.

1727
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:50,790
We'll proceed with the hanging
per schedule.

1728
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:52,790
You'll be in office exactly two days more.

1729
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,130
Then we're pulling your noses
out of the feed bag.

1730
01:31:55,210 --> 01:31:56,960
Give me the district attorney's office.

1731
01:31:57,050 --> 01:32:01,420
I'll tell you what you'll be doing ̶
making brooms in the state penitentiary.

1732
01:32:01,510 --> 01:32:04,260
Hello, D'Arrasty? This is Hartman talking.

1733
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:09,560
I've just arrested a couple of important birds
and I want you to take their confessions.

1734
01:32:10,430 --> 01:32:12,060
Duffy! Get Clarence Darrow!

1735
01:32:12,140 --> 01:32:14,770
All the lawyers in the world
aren't going to help you.

1736
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:16,940
This is the Morning Post
you're talking to.

1737
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:19,820
The power of the press, huh?

1738
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:22,780
Bigger men than you have found out
what the power of the press means.

1739
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:25,240
Presidents. Yes, and kings.

1740
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:28,830
Whenever you think you've got the Post licked,
that's a good time to get out of town.

1741
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:31,040
- On a handcar.
- Whistling in the dark, eh?

1742
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:33,250
It isn't going to help you this time.
You're through.

1743
01:32:33,330 --> 01:32:36,830
The last man that told me that was Eddie
Kane a week before he cut his throat.

1744
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:41,460
And I've got the same feeling right now that
I had five minutes before that happened.

1745
01:32:41,550 --> 01:32:43,170
Here's your reprieve.

1746
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:45,130
Get out of here!

1747
01:32:46,390 --> 01:32:48,100
You can't bribe me.

1748
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:50,140
What's all this? Get out of here, you!

1749
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:53,060
- I won't. Here's your reprieve.
- What?

1750
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:55,100
I don't want to be your city sealer.

1751
01:32:55,190 --> 01:32:57,400
- Who is this man?
- Who is bribing you?

1752
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:59,820
- They wouldn't take it.
- You're insane!

1753
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:04,740
What did I tell you? The unseen power!
What's your name?

1754
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:07,240
- Irving Pincus.
- You drunken idiot!

1755
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:10,700
Arrest that man. The idea of coming here
with a cock-and-bull story like that!

1756
01:33:10,790 --> 01:33:13,330
It's a frame-up! Some impostor.

1757
01:33:13,410 --> 01:33:15,710
- Hey, wait a minute!
- Murder, eh?

1758
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:17,670
Hanging an innocent man
to win an election, huh?

1759
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:19,790
- It's a lie!
- I never saw him before!

1760
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:21,340
Why, Fred!

1761
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:23,460
- When did you deliver this first?
- Who'd you talk to?

1762
01:33:23,550 --> 01:33:25,680
- They started right in bribing me.
- Who's "they"?

1763
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:28,470
- Them.
- That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns.

1764
01:33:28,550 --> 01:33:31,100
He's talking like a child.

1765
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:35,310
The unseen power.

1766
01:33:35,390 --> 01:33:37,770
He's insane or drunk or something.

1767
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:40,650
Since this unfortunate man, Williams,
has really been reprieved,

1768
01:33:40,730 --> 01:33:42,730
I personally am tickled to death.

1769
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:44,190
- Aren't you, Pete?
- Huh?

1770
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:46,490
Go on! You'd hang your mother
to win an election.

1771
01:33:46,570 --> 01:33:48,870
That's a horrible thing to say,
Johnson, about anybody.

1772
01:33:48,950 --> 01:33:51,410
Now, look here, Walter,
you're an intelligent man.

1773
01:33:51,490 --> 01:33:53,120
Now, wait a minute.

1774
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:55,250
All right, Mr. Pincus.
Let's have your story.

1775
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:58,790
- Well, I been married for 19 years and ̶
- Let's skip all that.

1776
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:01,880
Take those handcuffs off the boys, Pete.
That wasn't at all necessary.

1777
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:04,010
I was just going to.

1778
01:34:04,090 --> 01:34:08,260
Well, what are you waiting for?
Take the cuffs off the boys.

1779
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:10,720
Walter, I can't tell you
how badly I feel about this.

1780
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:13,010
There was no excuse
for Pete to fly off the handle.

1781
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:15,100
I was only doing my duty.

1782
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:17,390
There wasn't anything personal, men.

1783
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:20,270
Why don't you guys quit politics
and take in washing?

1784
01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:22,900
What did you say your name was?

1785
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:25,150
- Pincus?
- That's right.

1786
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:28,450
- Here's a picture of my wife.
- Yeah. A fine-looking woman.

1787
01:34:28,530 --> 01:34:30,870
Well, she's good enough for me.

1788
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:32,580
Boy, I'll bet she is.

1789
01:34:32,660 --> 01:34:36,120
Hildy! What's the matter?
What are they going to do?

1790
01:34:36,210 --> 01:34:39,330
- Those reporters said ̶
- Peggy, don't start to bawl me out now.

1791
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:41,540
Nobody's going to do anything to anybody.

1792
01:34:41,630 --> 01:34:45,420
Of course not. My old friend Walter Burns and
I understand each other perfectly, I trust.

1793
01:34:45,510 --> 01:34:47,260
And, uh, so do I.

1794
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:49,470
So do you what, you hoodoo?

1795
01:34:49,550 --> 01:34:51,390
Now, Mr. Pincus, if you'll come with us,

1796
01:34:51,470 --> 01:34:54,760
we'll take you over to the warden's office
and deliver this reprieve.

1797
01:34:54,850 --> 01:34:57,480
But, Hildy, they said they'd arrested you.

1798
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:03,650
By the way, Walter, we were going
to have a little feed after the hanging,

1799
01:35:03,730 --> 01:35:05,650
a sort of buffet breakfast.

1800
01:35:05,730 --> 01:35:08,110
- Hartman!
- I'm coming, Fred.

1801
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:10,150
What do you say if we eat it now?

1802
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:14,450
Delicious ham and some
of Mrs. Hartman's own preserves.

1803
01:35:15,950 --> 01:35:17,750
Hartman!

1804
01:35:17,830 --> 01:35:19,830
Dear.

1805
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,380
Wait till those two future pencil peddlers
read the Post in the morning.

1806
01:35:28,470 --> 01:35:30,930
Say, Hildy, get that guy Pincus
over to the office tomorrow ̶

1807
01:35:31,010 --> 01:35:32,640
Nothing doing.

1808
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:34,300
- I'm all washed up.
- What?

1809
01:35:34,390 --> 01:35:36,220
I mean it this time, Walter.

1810
01:35:36,310 --> 01:35:38,140
Hildy, if I only thought you did.

1811
01:35:38,230 --> 01:35:41,640
Peggy, if I'm not telling the
absolute truth, may I fall dead.

1812
01:35:41,730 --> 01:35:44,900
I'm going to New York with you
if you give me this one last chance.

1813
01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:47,190
I'm gonna cut out drinking and swearing

1814
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:50,360
and everything connected
with the crazy newspaper business.

1815
01:35:50,450 --> 01:35:52,110
Honey, I won't even read a newspaper.

1816
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:54,070
- I've got an idea.
- No.

1817
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:56,780
There's nothing you can say
that'll make me change my mind.

1818
01:35:56,870 --> 01:35:59,950
This time I'm through, and I mean it.

1819
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:04,000
Peggy, I've got a lot of nerve
to ask you to marry me.

1820
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:06,630
I'm a prize package, all right.

1821
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:08,550
But if you'll take me, here I am.

1822
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:12,340
Darling, don't talk that way.
I want you just the way you are.

1823
01:36:12,430 --> 01:36:15,050
Gosh, Hildy, I didn't know
it was anything like this.

1824
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:16,930
Why didn't you say something?

1825
01:36:17,010 --> 01:36:20,640
I'm the last fella in the world would want
to come between you and your happiness.

1826
01:36:20,730 --> 01:36:22,690
You ought to know that.

1827
01:36:22,770 --> 01:36:24,980
I love you, you crazy mug.

1828
01:36:25,060 --> 01:36:27,190
You're getting a great guy, Peggy.

1829
01:36:27,270 --> 01:36:29,440
Never mind the Valentines.

1830
01:36:29,530 --> 01:36:31,150
Good-bye, you turkey.

1831
01:36:32,610 --> 01:36:37,070
You're a great newspaperman, Hildy,
and I'm sorry to see you go.

1832
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:39,910
If I ever come back to the business ̶
which I won't ̶

1833
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:43,540
there's only one guy I'd work for.

1834
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:45,540
You know that, don't you?

1835
01:36:45,630 --> 01:36:48,420
Why, I'd kill you if you ever worked
for anybody else.

1836
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:51,510
You hear that, Peggy? That's my diploma.

1837
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:56,930
Gee, Walter, I don't know what to say

1838
01:36:57,010 --> 01:36:59,850
except... I'm going to miss you.

1839
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:02,390
Same here, son.

1840
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:05,390
Fifteen years we've been
knocking around together.

1841
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:07,100
That's before you were born, honey.

1842
01:37:07,190 --> 01:37:09,230
And what jams we've been in.

1843
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:11,480
And what excitement we've had.

1844
01:37:11,570 --> 01:37:15,820
Say, remember the time we hid the missing
heiress in the sauerkraut factory?

1845
01:37:15,910 --> 01:37:16,950
Do I?

1846
01:37:17,030 --> 01:37:19,990
Peggy, get him to tell you about the time
we stole old Lady Haggerty's stomach

1847
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:21,700
from the coroner's physician.

1848
01:37:21,790 --> 01:37:24,830
- We proved she was poisoned.
- We had to hide for a week.

1849
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:28,040
- Darling.
- What?

1850
01:37:28,130 --> 01:37:30,630
You don't want to go to New York,
down deep.

1851
01:37:33,220 --> 01:37:36,680
Well, I... I was just talking.

1852
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:41,720
I... I'd feel worse if I stayed, I guess.

1853
01:37:41,810 --> 01:37:44,600
If I thought you were going to be unhappy ̶

1854
01:37:44,690 --> 01:37:48,020
I mean, if you really wanted to ̶

1855
01:37:49,060 --> 01:37:52,530
No. This is your chance
to have a home and be a human being,

1856
01:37:52,610 --> 01:37:54,440
and I'm gonna make you take it.

1857
01:37:54,530 --> 01:37:58,450
Why, I wouldn't let him stay.
Go on, before I make you city editor.

1858
01:37:58,530 --> 01:38:01,080
Hurry up, Peggy. He means it.

1859
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:04,200
Any objections to my kissing the bride?

1860
01:38:04,290 --> 01:38:07,000
No, it's okay with me.

1861
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:10,080
Go ahead, Mrs. Johnson.

1862
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:15,920
Thanks. What time does your train go?

1863
01:38:16,010 --> 01:38:19,050
- There's another at 12:40.
- New York Central, eh?

1864
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:21,350
Gee, I wish I had time
to buy you a present, but ̶

1865
01:38:21,430 --> 01:38:24,140
Wait a minute. I've got it.

1866
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:26,730
Aw, no, Walter.

1867
01:38:26,810 --> 01:38:29,980
- You make me feel like I'm the bride.
- Shut up!

1868
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:32,110
It was a present from the big chief,

1869
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:35,070
and if you'll look inside,
you'll find a little inscription.

1870
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:38,320
"To the greatest newspaperman I know."

1871
01:38:38,410 --> 01:38:41,070
When you get to New York,
you can scratch out my name

1872
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:43,740
and put yours in its place, if you want to.

1873
01:38:43,830 --> 01:38:45,830
You know I wouldn't do that.

1874
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:50,040
Take it, Hildy. Mr. Burns wants you to.

1875
01:38:50,130 --> 01:38:52,130
You don't want to hurt his feelings.

1876
01:38:53,380 --> 01:38:57,380
Well, this is the first and last thing
I ever got from a newspaper.

1877
01:38:58,470 --> 01:39:00,380
Good-bye.

1878
01:39:00,470 --> 01:39:03,260
I've always had a queer opinion
of you, Mr. Burns.

1879
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:06,680
I still think you're a little peculiar,

1880
01:39:06,770 --> 01:39:09,270
but you're all right underneath.

1881
01:39:09,350 --> 01:39:12,690
I mean, I think you're a peach.

1882
01:39:12,770 --> 01:39:14,650
So are you.

1883
01:39:14,730 --> 01:39:17,030
You look just like a flower.

1884
01:39:17,990 --> 01:39:20,400
Good-bye, you big baboon.

1885
01:39:20,860 --> 01:39:22,450
Good-bye.

1886
01:39:22,530 --> 01:39:25,740
Good-bye, Johnson.
Be good to yourself and the little girl.

1887
01:39:25,830 --> 01:39:28,000
Same to you, and many of 'em.

1888
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:50,890
Duffy. Listen, Duffy.

1889
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:53,600
What's the first stop
of the 12:40 to New York?

1890
01:39:53,690 --> 01:39:57,690
That's right. I want you to send
a wire to the chief of police there.

1891
01:39:57,780 --> 01:40:00,740
Tell him to meet that train
and arrest Hildy Johnson.

1892
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:03,530
Bring him back here.

1893
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:05,950
Wire him a complete description.

1894
01:40:06,030 --> 01:40:08,620
The son of a ̶
stole my watch!
