1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Criswell Predicts...

2
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,400
Greetings, my friend. We are
all interested in the future,

3
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,100
for that is where you and I
are going to spend the
rest of our lives.

4
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:38,900
And remember my friend, future
events such as these will affect
you in the future.

5
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:45,300
You are interested in the
unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable.

6
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,500
That is why you are here.
And now, for the first time,

7
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,500
we are bringing to you the full story of what
happened on that fateful day.

8
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,000
We are giving you all the evidence, based
only on the secret testimonies

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,700
of the miserable souls who survived

10
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,800
this terrifying ordeal. The
incidents, the places,

11
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:13,800
my friend we cannot keep this a secret any longer.
Let us punish the guilty,

12
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:19,300
let us reward the innocent. My friend,

13
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,500
can your heart stand the shocking facts
about grave robbers

14
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,500
from outer space?

15
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,100
Plan 9 From Outer Space

16
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,100
All of us on this earth, know that
there is a time to live,

17
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,600
and that there is a time to die,
yet death is always a shock

18
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,500
to those left behind.

19
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,500
It is even more of a shock,when death,
the proud brother, comes suddenly without warning.

20
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,300
Just at sundown, a small group,

21
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,300
gathered in silent prayer around
the newly-opened grave

22
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,400
of the beloved wife of an elderly man.
Sundown of the day,

23
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,600
yet also the sundown of the old man's heart,

24
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,100
for the shadows of grief clouded his very reason.

25
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,600
The funeral over, the saddened group left the graveside.

26
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,300
It was when the gravediggers started their task

27
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,300
that strange things began to take place.

28
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,500
Fifteen to four.

29
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,400
Yup, right on schedule. There's the
ol' San Fernando Valley

30
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,000
out there now.
-You better radio in

31
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,500
for landing instructions, Danny.
-Right, Jeff.

32
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Burbank Tower, this is American
Flight 812, over.

33
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Wouldn't surprise
me any if  he's asleep this time of the morning.

34
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,000
American Flight 812, this is Burbank Tower.
If I were asleep

35
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
you'd never get on the ground !
Your case maybe you'd be up there for good. Over.

36
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,200
You got me that time, Mac.
This American Flight 812 requesting -

37
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812, over.

38
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812, over.

39
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,900
Holy mackeral.
-Burbank Tower to American Flight 812,

40
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,500
are you in trouble?

41
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,800
-Trouble ?
-Take a look for yourself.

42
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,600
-What in the world...
-That's nothing from this world.

43
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,700
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812,
are you in trouble? Are you in trouble?

44
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,700
-Mayday, mayday. Stand by, Burbank Tower.
-Do you suppose the passengers saw it?

45
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,600
I doubt it. Most of them are asleep.
But it was quite a jolt, Jeff. I'll check.

46
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,000
Good. We'll get them ready for landing.
Keep it quiet until we get instructions.

47
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
-Right.
-American Flight 812 reporting to Burbank Tower, over.

48
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,300
-D'you hear anything ?
-I thought I did.

49
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,600
Don't like hearin' noises.
'Specially when there ain't s'posed to be any.

50
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,200
-Yeah, sorta spooky-like.

51
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,600
-Maybe we're getting' old.
-Whatever it is it's gone now.

52
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,200
-That's the best thing for us too. Gone.

53
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,200
-Yeah, let's go.

54
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,900
The grief of his wife's death

55
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,900
became greater and greater agony.

56
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,800
The home they had so long shared together,
became a tomb.

57
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,300
A sweet memory of her joyous living.

58
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,900
The sky to which she had once looked,
was now only a covering for her dead body.

59
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,200
The ever-beautiful flowers she had
planted with her own hand,

60
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,500
became nothing more than the
lost roses of her cheeks.

61
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,300
Confused by his great loss, the old man

62
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,300
left that home,
never to return again.

63
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,700
At the funeral of the old man,
unknown to his mourners,

64
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,900
his dead wife was watching.

65
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,600
-First his wife, then he.
-Tragic.

66
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,000
-Tell me something. Why was his wife buried in the ground,
and

67
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,900
he sealed in a crypt?
-Something to do with family tradition.

68
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,100
A superstition of some sort.

69
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,100
Well, it's getting' dark. We'd best be on our way.

70
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,500
Then, as two of his mourners left his final resting place.

71
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,800
Minutes later, the police, lead by Inspector Daniel Clay,

72
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,000
arrived at the scene.

73
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,200
-Who found him ?
-The man and girl.

74
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,200
-Medical, uh, examiner been 'round yet?
-Just left.

75
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,400
The morgue wagon oughta be along most any time.
-You get their

76
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,400
statement ?
Yeah, much as we could. They're pretty scared.

77
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
-Finding a mess like this oughta make anyone frightened.

78
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,300
Have one of the boys take the guy
and the girl back to town. You take charge.

79
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,300
-Okay Inspector. What're you gonna do?

80
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,800
-Look around a little.
-Pretty dark out there.

81
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,000
Once you get beyond those lights you won't be
able to see your hand in front of your face.

82
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,100
-I will get one of the flashlights from the patrol car.

83
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,100
-You be careful Clay.
-I'm a big boy now, Johnny.

84
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,400
Looks like a bobcat tore through them.

85
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Yeah.

86
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,800
Say Lieutenant,

87
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,800
d'you get that funny odour ?
-How could I miss it ?

88
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,300
Oh, that'll be the morgue wagon now.

89
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,200
-That's the fifth siren in the last hour.
-Oh, something's happened down at

90
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,200
the cemetery. A lot of police cars and lights.
I stopped but I didn't see anything.

91
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,100
Oh well, whatever it is, the morning paper
will carry the whole story.

92
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,900
You seem to still be up there somewhere.

93
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,300
Maybe I am.

94
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,300
I don't think I've ever seen you
in this mood before.

95
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I guess it's because I've never been
in this mood before.

96
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,800
Something about your flight ?

97
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,700
Yeah.

98
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,700
What happened, Jeff ?

99
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,300
-I saw a flying saucer.
-A saucer ?

100
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,300
You mean the kind from up there ?
-Yeah, or its counterpart.

101
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,500
I was shaped like a huge cigar.
Dan [something] saw it too.

102
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,500
When it passed over, the whole compartment
lighted up with a blinding glare.

103
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,900
Then there was a tremendous wind that practically
knocked us off our course.

104
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,900
-Well did you report it ?
-Yeah, radioed in immediately and they said well

105
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
keep it quiet until you land.
Then as soon as we landed, big army brass grabbed us

106
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,200
and made us swear to
secrecy about the whole thing.

107
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,300
Oh, it burns me up. These things have been seen for years.
They're here, it's a fact.

108
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,300
And the public oughta know about it.
-There must be something more you can do about it.

109
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,300
Oh no there isn't.
Oh, but what's the point of making a fuss.

110
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Last night I saw a flying object that
couldn't possibly have been from this planet.

111
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,700
But I can't say a word. I'm muzzled by army brass!
I can't even admit I saw the thing!

112
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Sounds like Clay's in trouble.

113
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
Bet that apparition we saw had
something to do with it.

114
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,400
Come on.

115
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,900
-Is he dead ?
-Yeah.

116
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,300
He's messed up as bad as those two back there.

117
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,900
S'pose that saucer or whatever it was
had something to do with this?

118
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,900
Your guess is as good as mine, Larry.

119
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,700
But one thing's sure. Inspector Clay is dead...

120
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,700
murdered...and somebody's responsible!

121
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,500
You're in charge now, Lieutenant.

122
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,500
-Yeah, guess I am. Kelton.
-Yes Sir ?

123
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,500
Get back up to the car and get on the radio.
Tell the coroner he's gotta make another trip out here.

124
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,600
Well how 'bout the lab boys ?

125
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Well who do you think we left back at the car,
boy scouts ? Come on, Larry.

126
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Greater love hath no man, than to
lay down his life for another.

127
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,000
It is always difficult to have last words

128
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
over the grave of a friend.
And Inspector Daniel Clay was a friend.

129
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,700
A dear friend to me and to all of us.

130
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,300
The bell has rung upon his great career.

131
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:17,900
Now we lay him to rest. A rest well deserved, but so premature.

132
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,100
People turning south from the freeway
were startled when they saw

133
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,100
flying saucers high over Hollywood Boulevard.

134
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,100
A woman, startled by the sight in the
sky, telephones the police.

135
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,800
There comes a time in each man's life,

136
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,800
when he can't even believe his own eyes.

137
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,300
Saucers seen over Hollywood!

138
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,700
Flying saucers seen over Washington D.C.

139
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,600
The army convoy moved into the field.

140
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,000
Rockets were quickly set up.

141
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,700
Colonel Tom Edwards, in charge of saucer field activities,

142
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,900
was to make the greatest decision of his career.

143
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,900
He made that decision. Colonel Edwards gave the signal to fire.

144
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,800
Then as swiftly as they had come,
they were gone.

145
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,800
Even to the piercing eye of radar and the speeding jet fighters.

146
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,300
-Quite a sight, wasn't it Sir.
-A sight I'd rather not be seeing.

147
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,300
-Are you worried about them Sir ?

148
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
Well, they must have a reason for their visits.

149
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:49,300
Visits? Well that would indicate visitors!
Are big guns the usual way of welcoming visitors?

150
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,500
We haven't always fired at them.

151
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,500
For a time we tried to contact them by radio, but no response.

152
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:03,800
Then they attacked a town. A small town, I'll admit.
But nevertheless a town of people.

153
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,200
People who died.
-I never heard about that Sir.

154
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,200
Well, it was covered up by the higher echelon. Take any fire,

155
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,100
any earthquake, any major disaster,

156
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,100
then wonder.
Flying saucers, Captain,

157
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,800
are still a rumour.

158
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,300
Officially.

159
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,300
Looks like we beat them off again Sir.

160
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,300
What do they want...where are they from...where are they going...

161
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,700
They, Sir ? Who ?

162
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,000
Oh, this is a training manoeuver, Sir.
We only did a little practice firing at the clouds.

163
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,300
Yeah. I wonder what their next move will be.

164
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,900
What will their next move be ?

165
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,300
Your space commander has returned from Earth.

166
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,300
Send him in.

167
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,000
You have your report ?

168
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,900
We had to pull in here to
Space Station 7 for regeneration.

169
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,900
We're returning to the planet Earth
immediately thereafter.

170
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,700
-What progress has been made ?
-We contacted government officials.

171
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,500
They refuse over existence.

172
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
What plan will you follow now ?

173
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,500
Plan 9. It's been absolutely impossible to work through these Earth creatures.

174
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,300
Their soul is too controlled.

175
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,800
Plan 9...ah yes. Plan 9 deals

176
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,400
with the resurrection of the dead.

177
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,400
Long-distance electrodes shot into the pinion
pituitary glands of recent dead.

178
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,700
Have you attempted any of this plan as yet ?
-Yes Excellency.

179
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,200
How successful has it been ?

180
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,200
We have risen two so far.
We shall be just as successful on more.

181
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,200
The living...they have no suspicion of your movements ?

182
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,500
We had to dispose of one policeman.

183
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,900
However, none of those risen have been seen.
At least, not by anyone who still remains alive.

184
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,100
It's too bad it must be handled this way. However it must.

185
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,700
Those who take from the grave will lead the way for our other operations.

186
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,600
Yes, Excellency.
-Continue on. Report to me

187
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,600
in two Earth days.

188
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,900
I feared His Excellency wouldn't take our report this well.

189
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,200
Well had he been dealing with our own people
his reaction would have been completely different.

190
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,600
He understands the difficulties of the Earth race.

191
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,600
What do you think will be the next obstacle
the Earth people will put in our way?

192
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,700
Well, as long as they can think we'll have our problems.

193
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:03,200
But those whom we're using cannot think. They are the dead.
Brought to a simulated life by our electrode guns.

194
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:10,000
You know, it's an interesting think when you consider...the Earth people, who can think,

195
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,100
are so frightened by those who cannot: the dead.

196
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,100
Well our ship should be regenerated. We better get started.

197
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,900
I still think you oughta go in town and stay with your mother until I get back.

198
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,000
This is our home and nothing's going to take me from it.

199
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Besides, most men try and keep their wives from going home to Momma.

200
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,400
-That's not the point.
-That's all the point there's going to be.

201
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Now toddle off and fly your flying machine, Darling.
But if you see any more

202
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,100
flying saucers, will you tell them to pick another house to buzz?

203
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,400
Don't worry about me.

204
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,400
Oh you're the only thing I do worry about. Oh forget about the flying saucers.

205
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:53,900
They're up there. But there's something in that cemetery,

206
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,200
and that's too close for comfort.

207
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,100
The saucers are up there. And the cemetery's out there.

208
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:07,700
But I'll be locked up in there. Now off to your wild blue yonders.

209
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,100
You promise you'll lock the doors immediately ?

210
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,100
I promise. Besides, I'll be in bed before half an hour is gone,

211
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,400
with your pillow beside me.
-My pillow ?

212
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Well, I have to have something to keep me company while you're away.

213
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:30,500
Sometimes in the night when it does get a little lonely,
I reach over and touch it, then it doesn't seem so lonely anymore.

214
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,700
A crazy kid.

215
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,600
I do love you, Darlin'.

216
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,800
See you Thursday.
-Goodbye, Honey.

217
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,700
You know I'm not leaving here until you're locked safely inside.

218
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,700
All right, Darling.

219
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,100
If you're especially nice I may even lock the side door.

220
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,600
And be sure you keep the yard lights on.

221
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,900
You're mighty silent this trip, Jeff.

222
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,900
You haven't spoken ten words since takeoff.

223
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,100
I guess I'm preoccupied, Danny.

224
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,200
We've got thirty-three passengers back there that have time to be preoccupied.

225
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,700
Flying this flybird doesn't give you that opportunity.

226
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,800
I guess you're right, Danny.

227
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,000
-Paula ?
-Yeah.

228
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,200
-There's nothing wrong between you two ?
-Oh no, nothing like that.

229
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,800
Just that I'm worried, she being there alone and those strange things flying over the house and

230
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:25,200
those incidents in the graveyard the past few days. It's just got me worried.

231
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,700
the police have figured out that cemetery thing by now.

232
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,000
-I hope so.
-If you're really that worried Jeff why don't you radio in and find out?

233
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Mac should be on duty at the field by now.
He could call Paula and relay the message to you.

234
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,800
-Hi Edith.
-Hi Silents. I haven't heard a word from this end of the plane since we left the field.

235
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,400
Jeff's been giving me and himself a study in silence.

236
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,600
-You boys are feudin'?
-Oh no Edie, nothing like that.

237
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,300
Hey Edie, how about you and me balling [bawling?] it up in Albuquerque ?

238
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,900
Albuquerque ? Have you read that flight schedule Boy ?
-What about it ?

239
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,900
We land in Albuquerque at 4 am. That's strictly a nine o'clock town.

240
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,400
Well I know a friend that'll help us --

241
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,800
-Let's have a problem first, huh Danny. [?]
-Ah he's worried about Paula.

242
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,800
I read about that cemetery business.
I tried to get you kids to not buy too near one of those things.

243
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,500
He thought it'd be quiet and peaceful there.

244
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,900
No doubt about that.
It's quiet alright, like a tomb.

245
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,400
I'm sorry Jeff, that was a bad joke.

246
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,900
Say., I almost forgot what I came in here for.
How's the coffee situation?

247
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,000
-Mmmm that's for me.
-That sure wouldn't hurt anything, Edie.

248
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Okay, I'll be right back. And say Jeff, make that call to your wife.

249
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,500
Huh, not only will she throw water on my Albuquerque plan but now she's
repeating herself.

250
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,700
-How 'bout that Albuquerque ball ?
-I can't resist your charm, Danny Boy.

251
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:55,900
Residents near the cemetery paid little attention to the blast of thunder

252
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,700
and the flash of lightning.

253
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,500
But from the blast, arose the moving figure of the dead old man.

254
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,900
Hello ? Who ?

255
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Mac ? Well, hi Mac !

256
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,400
Sure I'm all right.

257
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,400
I just fell asleep.

258
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,000
Tell Jeff I'm all right.

259
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Okay Mac. Thanks for calling. Goodnight.

260
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,600
Mrs. Trent ! Mrs. Trent ! What's wrong ?

261
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,700
They'll be at the hatch in a moment.
You can open it now, Tanna.

262
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,800
Turn off the electrodes quickly.
They can't tell us from anyone else.

263
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,600
It's tough to find something when you don't know what you're looking for.

264
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,600
-I don't think the Lieutenant does either.
-Then what're doing out here? I was off duty an hour ago.

265
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Ah don't ask me any questions. I'm just a hardhand [hat? head?] just like you.

266
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,000
What do you suppose that noise was?

267
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,900
Whatever it was it's no more strange than the other things happening around this cemetery.

268
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,300
Spirits like Old Farmer Caulder talked about.

269
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:02,300
-Heh. Maybe.
-The only spirits he saw tonight were those I smelled on his breath.

270
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,300
Well don't forget Mrs. Trent claims to have seen them too.
She didn't have anything on her breath.

271
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,300
-She was hysterical.
-Well true, she was frightened, and in a state of shock.

272
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,800
But, don't forget that torn nightgown and the scratched feet.

273
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:22,300
Yeah I hadn't thought of that.
I guess that's why you're a detective lieutenant

274
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,000
and I'm still a uniformed cop.

275
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,400
Sometimes it's only the breaks, Larry. In the meantime let's get-

276
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,300
-Lieutenant, Lieutenant ! Did you hear that ?
-How could we help it ?

277
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,200
-It sure was strange.
-Know what it was ?

278
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,600
-No more than you do.
-If it weren't for orders I'd get out of here right now.

279
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,000
-It was a saucer.
-A flying saucer ? What makes you say that ?

280
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,600
You remember the noise we heard the other night ?

281
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,100
We were knocked to the ground, how could I forget ?

282
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,900
Exactly, but you're not remembering that sound.

283
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,900
There you're wrong, Lieutenant.
I'm with a fact the sound is similar, but what about the blinding light?

284
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,600
Well haven't you heard ?
Many times a saucer hasn't had a glow,

285
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:01,100
or a light of any kind for that matter.
-That proves it. What next Lietenant ?

286
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:07,800
Maybe this doesn't mean much,
but uh Jamie and me found a grave that looks like it's been busting into.

287
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,400
-What ? Where ?
-Why uh why...

288
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,900
-Come on man out with it, we haven't got all day to waste.

289
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,900
-Uh, just over there beyond the crypt.
-All right, show us the way !

290
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,800
Look, here it is Lieutenant.

291
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,000
Ah it's been broken into all right.

292
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Strange. If someone had broken in, the dirt should be piled up here somewhere.

293
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,900
It looks like it's fallen in into the grave.
-Larry you'll be out of that uniform before you know it.

294
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:43,100
-Do we have the right to look down there Lieutenant ?
-Ah, technically no.

295
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:48,900
Well, this spot looks familiar, though.
We shouldn't investigate any further without the permission of  next of kin.

296
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,700
Let's go get it !

297
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,700
-How ?
-I see what you mean, the gravestone's down there.

298
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,500
Well, let's go down and find out who's grave it is.

299
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,300
-How ?
-By going down and finding out !

300
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,300
-Are you sure you mean that Lieutenant ?
-If I didn't mean it I wouldn't have said it.

301
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,400
-Scared ?
-Well, why do I always get hooked up with these spook details?

302
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,400
Monsters, graves, bodies,...

303
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,400
oooh all right.

304
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,100
Casket's here, but nobody's in it.

305
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,900
Can you read the name on the casket?

306
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,200
It's too dark. Give me a flashlight.

307
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,200
-How 'bout a match ?
-We sure could try it. Let me have them !

308
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:52,300
It's Inspector Clay's grave !
Be he ain't in it!

309
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,200
But meanwhile, in the Pentagon, in Washington DC...

310
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,800
Try G2...

311
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,400
...come in !

312
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,400
Yes of course, I'll keep in touch.

313
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:25,800
Come in, Colonel Edwards. Close the door. At ease, Colonel.

314
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,500
-Thank you, Sir.
-Sit down.

315
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:37,000
I understand, Colonel, you've been on tap for many of our saucer attacks.

316
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,600
I'm in charge of field operations, Sir.

317
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,600
You believe there are such things as flying saucers, Colonel ?

318
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,100
-Yessir.
-You've seen them ?

319
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,900
Yessir.

320
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:54,500
You realize there's a government directive
stating that there is no such thing as a flying saucer?

321
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,500
Yessir.

322
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,800
Do you stand by your statement that you've seen flying saucers ?

323
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,200
Well, uh...

324
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,000
yessir.

325
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
This could mean a court marshall. Admitting this against direct orders.

326
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:15,500
General Roberts, may I speak freely ?

327
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,500
-You may.
How could I hope to hold down my command

328
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:22,500
if I didn't believe in what I saw and shot at?

329
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,500
-I, uh, like you Colonel.
-Thank you, Sir.

330
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,300
There are flying saucers.

331
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,600
There's no doubt they are in our skies.
They've been there for some time.

332
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,300
What're we going to do about them ?

333
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:45,000
-Who knows ?
-Then, uh, they really are there ?

334
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
-I thought you were convinced of that !
-I am.

335
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,400
We've had contact with them.

336
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,300
-Contact ? How ?
-Radio.

337
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,400
-They speak our language ?
-Well not quite.

338
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:02,700
We  received messages from their space ships.
For a while it came in as just a lot of jumbled noise.

339
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,600
And now, Sir ?

340
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:10,500
Well since they first uh tried contact with us by radio,
we've developed a language computer.

341
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,400
A machine that breaks down any language to our own.

342
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,400
General, uh,  what's this all got to do with me?

343
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:23,900
Well you've been in charge of saucer field activity for a long while.

344
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,800
I think it's about time you heard these recordings. Do you mind?

345
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,800
Mind ? Huh, I'm anxious !

346
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
This is Eros, a space soldier from a planet of your galaxy.

347
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:48,300
I fully realize our language differences,
however I also know you finally have

348
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:56,400
perfected the dictorobitary, or as you on Earth put it,
the language computer. So you can now understand that which I speak.

349
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,600
Since the beginning of your time, we have been far beyond your planet.

350
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:07,900
It has taken you centuries to even grasp what we developed eons of your years ago.

351
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,300
Do you still believe it impossible we exist?
You didn't actually think you were the only inhabited planet in the universe?

352
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,000
How can any race be so stupid ?

353
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,800
Permit me to set your mind at ease.
We do not want to conquer your planet. Only save it.

354
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,800
We could have destroyed it long ago, if that had been our aim.

355
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:36,400
Our principal purpose is friendly.
I admit, we have had to take certain means which you might

356
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,600
refer to as criminal,

357
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,600
but that is because of your big guns
which have destroyed some of our representatives.

358
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:50,400
If you persist in denying us our landings,
then we must only accept that you do not want us on friendly terms.

359
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:56,900
We then have no alternative but to destroy you before you destroy us.

360
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:05,600
With your ancient, juvenile minds, you have developed explosives too fast for your minds to conceive what you were doing.

361
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,900
You are on the verge of destroying the entire universe.

362
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,200
We are part of that universe.

363
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,200
This is our last -

364
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:23,700
That's the end of that one.
Atmospheric conditions in outer space often interfere with transmitting.

365
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,900
How many of these recordings do you have General ?

366
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,900
An even dozen up to now. This was the last one.
We received it over a month ago.

367
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,200
-Do you think they mean business ?
-We can't afford to take any chances.

368
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,000
Come over here. You ever been to Hollywood ?

369
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:45,000
-Oh a couple of times. A few years ago.
-You're going to be there in the morning.

370
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Just a few minutes from Hollywood, in the town of San Fernando, reports have come in

371
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
of saucers flying so low the exhaust  knocked people to the ground.

372
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,800
There have even been stated claims of saucer landings.

373
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:04,000
Major Carlson will replace you while you're out there.

374
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,300
You're the best man for the job of attempting to contact them.

375
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:11,100
Find them, Colonel. See what in hell it is they want!

376
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,100
All right, Sir.

377
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,600
These are confidential reports, Colonel.
Read them over carefully on the plane,

378
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:26,600
turn them over to intelligence when you get to Los Angeles.
They'll have further orders for disposition.

379
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,400
Yessir.

380
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,600
-Colonel Edwards ?
-Yessir ?

381
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,600
-Good luck.
-Thank you, Sir.

382
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,600
We are ready to report, Excellency.

383
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,600
-You are many days late.
-It was unavoidable.

384
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,600
We tried to transmit via televisor, but atmospheric
conditions made transmission impossible.

385
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,600
-You should have transmitted as soon as conditions permitted.
-I thought time was of the essence.

386
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,400
Suspicion  has fallen upon our movements.
Our ships have been viewed near the point of operations.

387
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,600
And what has this extra time gained, Eros?

388
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:32,600
We have successfully risen three of the dead ones.

389
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,700
-Permit me to see one.
-Bring in the big one.

390
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:39,700
Use your small electrode gun.

391
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,900
I have taken two ships from your command.

392
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:48,400
But...that will leave only my ship !

393
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,400
It is necessary that you continue your mission alone.

394
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,300
I have need of your other ships elsewhere.

395
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:01,300
Even though you have risen three of the Earth dead,
the plan is far from successful,

396
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,600
and you Eros, must prove it an operational success before
more time,

397
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:11,600
energy, and ships, may be spent on it.

398
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,900
We will not fail. Everything is on our side.

399
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:20,200
Not everything !
You do not have the live Earth people !

400
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:29,600
You report that your ship was viewed at scene of your present operations ?

401
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,000
That is correct.

402
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
They have been viewed many times, but not at the scene of operations.

403
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,300
Something must be done about that.

404
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:49,500
Stop him Tanna ! He's close enough ! Turn off your electrode gun !

405
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:53,700
No ! No ! Stop him Tanna !

406
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,200
I can't get it, it's jammed !
-Stop him you fool !

407
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,200
Drop the gun to the floor, Tanna !
The metal will break contact!

408
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:10,200
[Gasping] That was too close !

409
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,200
Yes.

410
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,900
Bring the giant here that I may get a better look at him.

411
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,700
Yes, he's a fine specimen.
Are they all this powerful on planet Earth ?

412
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,900
This one is an exception, Excellency.

413
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,900
-What are the other two like ?
-One is a woman, the other an old man.

414
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,900
-An old man, you say ?
-Yes, Excellency.

415
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:55,600
This gives me a plan. Put the big one away.

416
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,600
Pick up your electrode gun.
Make sure it's in working order before pointing it at him.

417
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,800
Whatever made it jam must have been cleared by the fall.

418
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,000
Take him back to the ship.

419
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:24,300
The old one must be sacrificed. Re-land on Earth.
Send the old one to enter a dwelling.

420
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:29,500
Then cut off the electrokinetic and turn on your ship's decomposure ray.

421
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:39,600
The result will astound those watching. Astound them enough to delay their attention until you have gained your other recruits from the cemetery.

422
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:44,000
Yes, Excellency. It'll be done.

423
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Report to me when this has been accomplished.

424
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:58,300
Eros, the Earth people are getting to that which we fear.

425
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:02,200
Since they will not listen or respect our existence,

426
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,200
they cannot help but believe our powers when they see their own dead walking 'round again,

427
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:11,500
brought about by our advancement in such things. As soon as you have enough of the dead recruits,

428
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:21,000
march them on the capitals of the Earth, let nothing stand in your way. Their own dead will be used to make them accept our existence, and believe in that fact.

429
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:08,100
Mr. and Mrs. Trent...this is Colonel Edwards from Washington DC.

430
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,500
-Good evening, Colonel.
-Hello Colonel.

431
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,700
Colonel would like to ask you a few questions.

432
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:16,700
-Questions ? What about, Colonel ?
-May I, uh, sit down ?

433
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,600
Oh, I'm sorry, please do.

434
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,600
I want to ask you about your strange experience the other night, when you saw the flying saucer.

435
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,800
After that the police brought me home.

436
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,200
I hope I never see such a sight again.

437
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,600
Well after your description I don't think I'd want to see it either.

438
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,600
One thing
more...after you were forced to the ground by that blast of wind,

439
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:47,400
was it a hot or cold blast?
-It's kind of hard to explain.

440
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:53,500
It wasn't hot, wasn't cold, it was just a terrific force. We-we couldn't get off the ground.

441
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,800
The light blinded me so badly I couldn't see a thing.

442
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:03,300
We could only feel the pressure of the wind, until it was gone.
When the glare left us,

443
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,700
we could see a glowing ball disappearing off in the distance.

444
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,300
-Which way ?
-Toward the cemetery.

445
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:28,700
This is the most fantastic story I've ever heard.

446
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,600
And every word of it's true, too.

447
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,000
That's the fantastic part of it.

448
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
We found a lot of suspicious things out in that cemetery.

449
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:41,300
Then again, didn't find anything to base a fact or suspicion on.

450
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,800
Hey, do you hear anything.

451
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,200
You see anything out there Kelton ?

452
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,000
Too dark, Lieutenant.

453
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
But something's started stinking awful bad.

454
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:13,500
There's something out there.

455
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:44,900
-What do you make of that ?
-You got me ! It didn't look that way a minute ago.

456
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,400
-What about your man ?
-Oh, in the excitement I forgot all about Kelton.

457
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,900
Oh, he'll be all right in a few minutes.

458
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,800
-Did you see that thing ? Did you get it ?
-We got it.

459
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:08,700
What was it ? It didn't fall...I fired every bullet I had.

460
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:14,200
So did I. I don't know what it was or what happened, but unless that bag of bones

461
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:17,800
can reassemble itself, it's out of the running now.

462
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,600
Colonel I've been out here so often you'd think I'd taken a lease on this place.

463
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,600
Not a long lease, I hope.

464
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:38,600
I see what you mean. But you know, I can't help but feel the answer's out here
somewhere.

465
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,600
Is the uh girl safe ?

466
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,900
Mrs. Trent you'd better stay with the car.
-Stay here alone? Not on your life.

467
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,600
-Modern women...
-Yeah, they been that way all down through the ages.

468
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,300
Especially in a spot like this.

469
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,400
-Kelton ! -Yessir ?
-Stay with Mrs. Trent.

470
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,400
All right, Lieutenant.

471
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:01,100
-Now you stay close to the officer, Honey.
-I'd feel safer with you.

472
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:10,700
-Now the Lieutenant knows best.
-Oh I don't like it, but I guess there isn't much I can do about it.

473
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,900
-You have a gun ?
-No.

474
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:21,900
Know how to use one ?

475
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,900
After four years in the Marine Corps ?

476
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,700
-Here.
-You think we'll need these ?

477
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,500
You can never tell. Let's get going.

478
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,300
-What do you expect to find out here ?
-Well there's only one answer to that Mr. Trent,

479
00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:00,700
we'll know when we find it. Inspector Clay's grave is right over here.

480
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:04,500
-Is that the one you told me was broken into ?
-Yes.

481
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,000
-This it ?
-Yeah.

482
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,700
Looks to me like someone had broken out instead of in.

483
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:33,600
-I figured that, but that's impossible ! -I wonder.
-Look, Colonel, some things just can't happen.

484
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:40,300
Yeah well after that apparition that was draped across Mr. Trent's patio, I would say we should keep our minds open to anything.

485
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,400
Look, Colonel, I'm a policeman. I've got to deal in facts.

486
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:52,000
But, I guess I'll have to go along with you.  You know I bet my badge right now we haven't seen the last of those weirdies.

487
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,900
-They'll discover our ship soon.
-You going to let them find us ?

488
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:04,900
It's the only way. These are the same men who have been so close so often.

489
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:08,200
They must be halted before they can inform others about us.

490
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,200
-But there were others in the car !
-They'll be taken too.

491
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:18,500
Send the big one to get the girl and the policeman. I'll turn on the dictorobitary so we may converse with them.

492
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,600
You know, maybe we're barking up the wrong tree.

493
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,600
One thing a policeman learns, Mr. Trent, is patience.

494
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:00,600
-Where the burn spot you mentioned.
-Right over the - look!

495
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,300
We'll investigate, but move carefully.

496
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:02,500
A moment or two more, and you will be the first live Earth people

497
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,700
ever to enter a celestial ship.

498
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:10,100
Wow...boy,  how could anything that big hide for so long a time ?

499
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,400
Never heard metal sound like that before.

500
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,400
-What do you see ?
-Only my reflection. Must be some kind of one-way glass.

501
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:24,100
-How do you get into this thing ?
-I'm not sure I want to find out.

502
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:37,700
They're just outside.

503
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,200
You can open the outer hatch now.

504
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,100
-You goin' in that thing ?
-That's what we're here for.

505
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:10,100
-I don't know, the way these things speed around we might just get in there and pft! Off it goes.
-That's a chance we take.

506
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:17,100
Well, I took a chance on those earlier airplanes. Might just as well see what the inside of one of these looks like. Got your guns ready ?

507
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:23,100
-I tell you one thing, if a little green man jumps out at me I'm shooting first and asking questions later.

508
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:33,800
They're in the outer chamber now.

509
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:39,800
Eros, do we have to kill them ?

510
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:45,200
-Yes.
-It seems such a waste.

511
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:50,800
Well wouldn't it be better to kill a few now than, with their meddling, permit
them  to destroy the entire universe ?

512
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,100
-You're always right, Eros.
-Of course.

513
01:02:56,100 --> 01:03:00,100
But those are not my words, those are the words of the Ruler.

514
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:07,900
Now you two stay right where you're at.

515
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:20,900
We will do as you command. For the moment.
-No for the moment about it. You just do as I tell you.

516
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:32,600
You do not need guns.
-Maybe we think we do.

517
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,900
They would be of no use to you now.
-They've been mighty useful before on flesh and blood,

518
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:40,700
and you two look like you've got a lot of both.

519
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:48,200
True, they would be effective upon us. If you were to have the opportunity to use them...

520
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:53,500
Mister, if you don't get away from that control board I'll show you just how
effective they can be.

521
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:01,500
Shall we talk now, or wait ? Your friends will be here shortly.

522
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:05,100
-What friends ?
-Those you left at the vehicle.

523
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,100
-If you've done anything to Paula...
-Take it easy Mr. Trent.

524
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:13,100
Oh I assure you, no harm has come to her. Would you like to see?

525
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:19,600
Next time you try that I won't aim at the board.
-You're a headstrong young man.

526
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:23,200
I was only going to turn on the televisor so you could see her movements.

527
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:30,900
Go ahead, my friend, but move very carefully.

528
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,100
She's only fainted.

529
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:51,900
-You fiend !
-I ? A fiend ? ...

530
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:55,600
I am a soldier of our planet !

531
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:03,100
I ? A fiend ? We did not come here as enemies.

532
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,900
We came only with friendly intentions. To talk.

533
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,500
To ask your aid.

534
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,100
-Our aid ?
-Yes.

535
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:18,500
Your aid for the whole universe. But your governments of Earth refused even to accept our existence.

536
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:24,900
Even though you've seen us, heard our messages, you still refused to accept us.

537
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:29,500
Why is it so important that you want to contact the governments of our Earth ?

538
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:33,700
Because of death. Because all you of Earth are idiots !

539
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,800
-Now you just hold on, Buster.
-No you hold on.

540
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:43,500
First was your firecracker, a harmless explosive. Then your handgrenade.

541
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:51,200
They began to kill your own people a few at a time. Then the bomb, then a larger bomb.

542
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:56,100
Many people are killed at one time. Then your scientists

543
01:05:56,200 --> 01:06:00,200
stumbled upon the atom bomb. Split the atom.

544
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:04,600
Then the hydrogen bomb, where you actually explode the air itself.

545
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:11,300
Now you [audio jump] brings the destruction of the entire universe, served by our sun.

546
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:17,200
The only explosion left is the solaronite.

547
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:21,200
-Why there's no such thing.
-Perhaps to you.

548
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:26,200
But we've known it for centuries. Your scientists will stumble upon it as they have all the others.

549
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:33,600
But the juvenile minds you possess will not comprehend its strength, until it's too late.

550
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,400
You're way above our heads.

551
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:41,400
The solaronite is a way to explode the actual particles of sunlight.

552
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,300
Why that's impossible.

553
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:48,300
Even now, your scientists are working on a way to harness the sun's rays.

554
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:51,600
The rays of sunlight are minute particles.

555
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:55,600
Is it so far from your imagination they cannot do as I have suggested?

556
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,900
Why a particle of sunlight can't even be seen or measured.

557
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:02,900
Can you see or measure an atom ? Yet you can explode one.

558
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:06,800
A ray of sunlight is made up many atoms.

559
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:10,800
So what if we do developed this solaronite bomb ? We'd be even a stronger nation than now.

560
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:17,300
Stronger. You see ? You see ? Your stupid minds...stupid ! Stupid !!

561
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,500
-That's all I'm taking from you !
-Get back here you jerk !

562
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:22,300
Let him finish.

563
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:33,600
It's because of men like you that all must be destroyed.

564
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:38,600
Headstrong, violent ! No use of the mind God gave you.

565
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:42,100
You talk of God ?

566
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:46,100
You also think it impossible that we, too, might think of God ?

567
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:56,100
You,  who wear the uniform of your country. You see, I wear the uniform of my country.

568
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:03,200
Yes, we've had to use drastic means to get to you, but you left us no alternative.

569
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:10,800
When you have the solaronite, you have nothing. Nor, does the universe.

570
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:16,100
You speak of solaronite, but just what is it ?

571
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Take a can of your gasoline. Say this can of gasoline is the sun.

572
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:29,200
Now you spread a thin a line of it to a ball, representing the Earth.

573
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:35,200
Now, the gasoline represents the sunlight, the sun particles.

574
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:40,300
Here we saturate the ball with the gasoline, the sunlight.

575
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,600
Then we put a flame to the ball. The flame will speedily travel around the Earth,

576
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:49,200
back along the line of gasoline to can,

577
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:57,200
or the sun itself. It will explode this source, and spread to every place that gasoline, or sunlight, touches.

578
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:04,200
Explode the sunlight here, Gentlemen, and you explode the universe.

579
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:11,900
Explode the sunlight here, and a chain reaction will occur, direct to the sun itself.

580
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:16,200
And to all the planets that sunlight touches.

581
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:21,200
To every planet in the universe. This why you must be stopped.

582
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,600
This is why any means must be used to stop you.

583
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:31,900
In a friendly manner, or as it seems, you want it.

584
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:38,000
-He's mad.
-Mad ? Is it mad that you destroy other people to save yourselves ?

585
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,400
You have done this.

586
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:44,400
Is it mad that one country must destroy another to save themselves ?

587
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:48,400
You have also done this. How then is it mad that one planet

588
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:52,700
must destroy another that threatens the very existence-
-That's enough !!

589
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:59,100
In my land, women are for advancing the race, not for fighting

590
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:04,400
man's battles. Life is not so expansive on my planet.

591
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:10,200
We don't cling to it like you do. Our entire aim is for the development of our planet.

592
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,800
-What happened to you ?
-How come you're all alone ?

593
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,800
I asked for lots of help !
-You sounded drunk or something on the radio.

594
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,800
-If I didn't see it with my own eyes I would never have believed it !
-Believed what ?

595
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:42,300
It was horrible ! And he almost broke my shoulder !

596
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:47,300
Look, what are you trying to say ? If you don't make sense we'll never get to the bottom of this. Now who slugged you ?

597
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,800
Inspector Clay.

598
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:53,800
-What ?
-It was Clay all right, only not like we remembered him.

599
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:57,900
Well his grave was busted into, wasn't it ?

600
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:00,100
Next you'll tell me you saw skeletons.

601
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:04,100
-We did, earlier.
-Now I know you're off your rocker.

602
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:07,600
All of us saw, the Lieutenant, the Colonel, everybody!

603
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,400
-Where's the Lieutenant now ?
-We've gotta find them.

604
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:16,000
Mrs. Trent is gone! I was left here to guard her. Then Clay showed up and put me out of the running.

605
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:19,000
And the second time tonight and I'm getting darned tired of it !

606
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,400
-Which way were they going ?
-Oh, that way.

607
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:22,400
Come on !

608
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:34,500
Then one day it could all be gone, in one big puff of smoke

609
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:38,700
and ball of fire. All that out there,

610
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:43,000
the stars, the planets,

611
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,100
all just an empty void.

612
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:48,800
You two had better come along with us.

613
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,800
-Come with you ? Where ?
-The police station.

614
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:59,300
So it seems you think you have the upper hand.

615
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,600
Look out there.

616
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:07,700
Jeff.

617
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:22,400
She is unharmed, but he would kill in seconds if I so choose.

618
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,400
Holy cow!

619
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,500
Look there.

620
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:50,900
It's Clay all right, there's no mistaking that.
-And he's got Mrs. Trent !

621
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,600
-Get your gun ready.
-From all I've seen tonight guns won't do any good.

622
01:12:55,700 --> 01:13:00,000
Clay is dead, and we buried him. How are we going to kill somebody that's already dead ?

623
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:05,700
Dead ! And yet there he stands ! That other one earlier I emptied a full clip into him.

624
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,800
I'm seeing it, that's the only reason I'm listening to you.

625
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:17,100
Look, I've got an idea. Hurt him or not, we've got to try something.

626
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:21,500
I'm going to sneak up behind him and whop him over the head. That oughta make him move.

627
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:25,900
Follow me. Even when Clay was alive he couldn't run fast enough to catch me,

628
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:30,200
so when he does, you grab Mrs. Trent and run like lightning in the opposite direction.

629
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:33,700
-Oh, you think it will work ?
-Know anything else to try ?

630
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:55,800
Oh, I'll be all right. Take care of the others.

631
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:00,900
Your men have felled the big one.

632
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:04,600
This could only happen because the electrode ray is off.

633
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,600
He'll walk again when I turn it on.

634
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,300
Hold it, right there.

635
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:13,300
-Suppose the Lieutenant and the others are in that thing !
-Well suppose there are martians or something in there !

636
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:23,700
Come on, let's go.

637
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:28,300
Open up in there, open up !

638
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:36,200
-Get that door open.
-Colonel I wouldn't know one switch from another.

639
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,400
Hold on Eros, I'll have the ship in the air in a minute !

640
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,300
Get out of here, Jeff ! The ship's on fire !

641
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,600
Eros !

642
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:45,600
Eros everything's on fire ! Hurry, wake up Eros ! Eros, Eros, wake up, wake up !

643
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:56,700
Eros! Eros wake up, Eros! God wake up!

644
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,100
Oh, I wonder if that's the last we'll see of them ?

645
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:21,000
Perhaps, but sooner or later there'll be other.

646
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Look !

647
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:30,800
Have they caught that woman, that thing yet ?

648
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,300
Hey that's right, there's another ghoul running loose.

649
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:35,700
And it's my guess that she'll look like him.

650
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:39,700
With the ship and the ray gun gone, they have no control.

651
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:44,600
We got to hand it to them though, they're far ahead from us.

652
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:53,200
Fire ! Eros ! Aaaaaaaaah !

653
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:05,200
My friend, you have seen this incident based on sworn testimony.

654
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:09,300
Can you prove that it didn't happen ?

655
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:13,300
Perhaps on your way home, you will pass someone in the dark,

656
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:17,500
and you will never know it, for they will be from outer space.

657
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:23,200
Many scientists believe that another world is watching us this moment.

658
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:26,800
We once laughed at the horseless carriage,

659
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,800
the aeroplane, the telephone, the electric light, vitamins,

660
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,500
radio, and even television !

661
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:38,500
And now some of us laugh at outer space.

662
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:46,400
God help us... in the future.
