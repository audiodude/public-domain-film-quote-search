1
00:00:32,264 --> 00:00:34,198
Hey, Joe, drag your foot, boy.

2
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:37,599
Look what we got here.
You wanna drag ?

3
00:00:37,669 --> 00:00:40,035
- Sure.

4
00:00:40,105 --> 00:00:42,096
Come on, man, get ready.

5
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:01,984
I'll show 'em how to drive.
Just watch me.

6
00:01:49,207 --> 00:01:51,141
Aah !

7
00:03:39,017 --> 00:03:41,781
Sir, as high as this
river is right now...

8
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:44,287
and with all the mud
and sand it's carryin',

9
00:03:44,356 --> 00:03:46,984
they may never
find that car.

10
00:03:51,062 --> 00:03:53,223
Uh-uh.

11
00:03:54,532 --> 00:03:56,466
<i>Right there.</i>

12
00:03:56,534 --> 00:03:59,799
All right, now let's hear your story
about how it happened.

13
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:03,102
- It wasn't our fault, sir.
- Yeah ?

14
00:04:03,174 --> 00:04:05,574
We were the first ones
on the bridge...

15
00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:07,941
and coming a-along
following the tracks,

16
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:09,947
and they wanted
to get around us...

17
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:12,074
and they lost control--

18
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,084
You sure you didn't
crowd 'em off?

19
00:04:25,563 --> 00:04:27,656
Three hours.

20
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:30,667
Yeah ? Not sure
I wanna find that car now.

21
00:04:30,735 --> 00:04:33,898
With this sand and with that current,
we may never find 'em.

22
00:04:33,972 --> 00:04:36,133
Guess all we can do
is keep tryin'.

23
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:06,362
Come on,
let's get down there.

24
00:05:25,723 --> 00:05:28,556
<i>Why, it's Mary Henry.</i>

25
00:05:28,626 --> 00:05:30,560
Are you all right ?

26
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:32,721
How'd you get out ?

27
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:35,789
Here, put this on.
We'd better get you back to town.

28
00:05:39,304 --> 00:05:41,898
<i>What about</i>
<i>the other girls ?</i>

29
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:47,434
<i>I don't remember.</i>

30
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:23,931
Is this like the one
I'll be playing in Utah ?

31
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:25,936
It's quite similar.

32
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:28,768
I supervised
the installation myself.

33
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,274
The accident won't delay
your going, will it ?

34
00:08:31,342 --> 00:08:33,833
<i>No. I'm leaving</i>
<i>this morning.</i>

35
00:08:33,911 --> 00:08:36,880
- There's nothing I can do here.
- That's right.

36
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:40,145
Well, Mary, you'll make
a fine organist for that church.

37
00:08:40,218 --> 00:08:42,311
Be very satisfying
to you, I think.

38
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:44,321
It's just a job to me.

39
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:47,825
Well, that's not quite the attitude
for going into church work.

40
00:08:47,892 --> 00:08:51,157
I'm not taking the vows.
I'm only going to play the organ.

41
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:53,220
Oh, you want
more than that.

42
00:08:53,298 --> 00:08:58,395
Of course it doesn't pay much,
but, well, at least it's a start.

43
00:08:58,469 --> 00:09:01,632
Are you driving by Benton
to see your folks ?

44
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:04,300
No, I can't.
I-I must hurry.

45
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,867
I've got to leave.
I'm going to drive straight through.

46
00:09:07,945 --> 00:09:12,814
Mary, it takes more than intellect
to be a musician.

47
00:09:12,884 --> 00:09:16,342
Put your soul
into it a little, okay ?

48
00:09:22,894 --> 00:09:25,294
Good luck, Mary.

49
00:09:25,363 --> 00:09:27,763
<i>Stop by and see us</i>
<i>the next time you're in.</i>

50
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:31,029
Thank you,
but I'm never coming back.

51
00:13:30,408 --> 00:13:32,342
May I help you ?

52
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,004
- Fill it up.
- All right.

53
00:14:00,171 --> 00:14:02,833
Will there be
anything else, lady ?

54
00:14:02,907 --> 00:14:07,503
Could you tell me what
that big structure is back
a few miles by the lake ?

55
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:10,069
Oh, you mean
the old bathhouse.

56
00:14:10,147 --> 00:14:13,173
Yeah, that used to be
a pretty ritzy place in the old days.

57
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,617
Then the lake went down
and they made a dance hall out of it.

58
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:18,848
Then they put those
buildings up out there...

59
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:21,858
and made some sort of
a carnival there for a while.

60
00:14:21,926 --> 00:14:25,760
That's years ago, though.
Just stands out there now.

61
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,764
I see.

62
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:35,538
I have an address here of
a rooming house. Could you direct me ?

63
00:14:35,606 --> 00:14:38,973
Oh, sure. Why, that's just
right over here a little way.

64
00:14:47,151 --> 00:14:50,416
Been savin' it for you
since I got your letter.

65
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:55,655
Could've rented it
yesterday if I'd wanted.

66
00:14:55,726 --> 00:14:57,660
Oh, it's fine.

67
00:14:57,728 --> 00:14:59,662
It's just about
what I expected.

68
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,290
I knew
you'd like it.

69
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:05,096
This ain't no regular
roomin' house, you know.

70
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:09,333
I only got you and
Mr. Linden across the hall.

71
00:15:15,046 --> 00:15:18,482
Each room's got its own
private bathroom, too.

72
00:15:21,352 --> 00:15:23,616
You can take
all the baths you want.

73
00:15:23,688 --> 00:15:26,555
I'm not one to fuss
about things like that.

74
00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:29,286
Thank you. I think I'll be
quite comfortable.

75
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,022
Well, hope you'll
stay a while.

76
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:35,156
I'm downstairs
in the back part of the house,

77
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:37,996
so if there's
anything else you need,

78
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:40,503
guess it'll have to
wait till morning.

79
00:15:43,974 --> 00:15:45,908
Night.

80
00:15:45,976 --> 00:15:48,240
Good night,
Mrs. Thomas.

81
00:16:44,702 --> 00:16:48,968
And this, Miss Henry,
is our pride and joy.

82
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:51,769
This was made in the same town
where I've been studying.

83
00:16:51,842 --> 00:16:54,970
Of course.
That's where we heard about you.

84
00:16:55,045 --> 00:16:57,479
By the way, you have found
a place to stay ?

85
00:16:57,548 --> 00:17:00,016
- Yes, I have a room.
- Good.

86
00:17:00,084 --> 00:17:02,848
Well, we hope you're
going to like it here.

87
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,855
We're not the largest church
in this area, of course,

88
00:17:05,923 --> 00:17:09,415
but we have
a nice congregation.

89
00:17:09,493 --> 00:17:12,724
We'll have to have some sort
of reception. They'll want to meet you.

90
00:17:12,797 --> 00:17:16,324
- Couldn't we just skip that ?
- Skip that ?

91
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,563
I don't suppose it's
an absolute necessity.

92
00:17:19,637 --> 00:17:22,572
I don't know what some
of the ladies will say.

93
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,041
If they say I'm a fine organist,
that should be enough, shouldn't it ?

94
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,704
Well, yes, of course.

95
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:32,078
We'll let it go at that
for the time being.

96
00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:34,777
But, my dear,

97
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:37,082
you cannot live
in isolation...

98
00:17:37,154 --> 00:17:39,850
from the human race,
you know.

99
00:17:39,924 --> 00:17:41,858
Mind if I try this now ?

100
00:17:41,926 --> 00:17:43,860
I want you to.

101
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:05,982
You go right ahead.

102
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:09,315
I'll be next door at the manse,
if you need me.

103
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:28,599
We have an organist
capable of stirring the soul.

104
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:26,529
What do you see ?

105
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:29,498
Oh. Nothing.
Nothing at all.

106
00:19:29,566 --> 00:19:34,094
- I've practiced all afternoon
and it's gotten me in a mood.
- <i>You need some fresh air.</i>

107
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:36,639
I've got to make a call
out past the lake.

108
00:19:36,707 --> 00:19:38,868
Would you like to
come along for the ride ?

109
00:19:38,943 --> 00:19:41,138
You know that old
pavilion out there ?

110
00:19:41,211 --> 00:19:43,475
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
- Will we pass it ?

111
00:19:43,547 --> 00:19:46,209
<i>Go right by it.</i>
<i>Stop and look at it if you like.</i>

112
00:19:46,283 --> 00:19:49,150
- I would, with you along.
- <i>Good.</i>

113
00:20:24,588 --> 00:20:26,818
This used to be
quite a place.

114
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:30,951
-<i>It's been deserted for a long time now.</i>
-<i>Will you take me in ?</i>

115
00:20:31,028 --> 00:20:34,987
Why, goodness no.
It isn't safe out there anymore.

116
00:20:35,065 --> 00:20:37,226
That's why they
put up this barrier.

117
00:20:37,301 --> 00:20:40,498
It'd be very easy
to step around it.

118
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:45,508
- What attraction could
there be for you out there ?
- I'm not sure.

119
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:48,636
I'm a reasonable person.
I don't know.

120
00:20:48,712 --> 00:20:54,275
Maybe I want to satisfy myself
that the place is nothing more
than it appears to be.

121
00:20:54,351 --> 00:20:56,717
- Would you take me out there ?
- No.

122
00:20:56,787 --> 00:20:58,948
The law has placed it
off-limits.

123
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:02,686
Wouldn't be very seemly for
a minister to break the law, would it ?

124
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,720
No. Maybe I can
come back some other time.

125
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:10,266
Shall we
go along now ?

126
00:21:36,627 --> 00:21:38,561
I thought that'd be you.

127
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:40,597
Good evening.

128
00:21:40,664 --> 00:21:42,598
That organ playin'
must take a long time.

129
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,657
You've been gone
most the whole day.

130
00:21:44,735 --> 00:21:48,762
I went for a long drive
in the country with my new boss,

131
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:50,830
an elderly minister.

132
00:21:50,908 --> 00:21:53,035
Oh, ho.

133
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,772
That must have been
a kick in the head.

134
00:21:57,081 --> 00:22:00,676
I learned that from my
other boarder, Mr. Linden.

135
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:02,685
Did you get
your supper ?

136
00:22:02,753 --> 00:22:04,948
Oh, I forgot.

137
00:22:05,022 --> 00:22:07,513
Well, this ain't
no boarding house,

138
00:22:07,591 --> 00:22:10,856
but I got some coffee
and sandwich makin's.

139
00:22:10,928 --> 00:22:13,419
I could bring you some up
after a while.

140
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:17,194
Good. I'll be taking one of those baths
you're so generous with.

141
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:19,201
Take as many
as you want.

142
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:22,432
I ain't one to make a fuss
about a thing like that.

143
00:23:08,685 --> 00:23:11,085
Come in, Mrs. Thomas.

144
00:23:12,756 --> 00:23:15,020
Just a minute.

145
00:23:34,077 --> 00:23:37,672
I thought you were Mrs. Thomas !

146
00:23:37,748 --> 00:23:40,683
Yeah, I wondered
when you asked me in.

147
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:43,413
I'm John Linden.
I'm your neighbor across the hall.

148
00:23:43,487 --> 00:23:46,581
- Nice to meet you. Would you excuse--
- Hey, I, uh--

149
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:49,125
Just stand right there.

150
00:24:15,452 --> 00:24:18,182
I forgot to introduce myself.
I'm Mary Henry.

151
00:24:18,255 --> 00:24:20,849
Yeah, I know.
I, uh--

152
00:24:20,924 --> 00:24:24,052
I heard you tell Mrs. Thomas
you haven't ate anything yet, huh ?

153
00:24:24,127 --> 00:24:26,789
I just thought, bein'
neighborly and all--

154
00:24:26,863 --> 00:24:28,797
I haven't eaten
anything either.

155
00:24:28,865 --> 00:24:31,265
I just thought I'd
ask you out to dinner.

156
00:24:31,335 --> 00:24:33,769
That's very thoughtful,
but I can't accept.

157
00:24:33,837 --> 00:24:36,271
I know we haven't met or anything yet,
but I just thought--

158
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,740
I'm sorry.
You'll have to excuse me.

159
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:43,143
There's a real nice restaurant right
down the street, and I just thought--

160
00:24:43,213 --> 00:24:46,046
I'm the kind of guy
who doesn't like to eat by himself.

161
00:24:46,116 --> 00:24:49,449
I've made arrangements
to eat in my room tonight.

162
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:51,453
Okay, if--

163
00:24:51,521 --> 00:24:53,955
If you change your mind,
you just holler.

164
00:24:56,426 --> 00:24:58,860
Looks kind of
lonesome in here.

165
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:01,193
Good night, Mr. Linden.

166
00:26:23,513 --> 00:26:25,640
Miss Henry ?

167
00:26:25,716 --> 00:26:27,650
It's Mrs. Thomas.

168
00:26:39,463 --> 00:26:41,397
Hmm.

169
00:26:46,403 --> 00:26:48,894
Who's the man
in the hall ?

170
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,274
The--

171
00:26:52,342 --> 00:26:56,278
Oh, you must mean
Mr. Linden.

172
00:26:56,346 --> 00:26:59,008
He has the room
across the hall.

173
00:26:59,082 --> 00:27:02,643
No. I mean
the other one.

174
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:04,983
There is no other.

175
00:27:06,223 --> 00:27:09,124
Me and you
and Mr. Linden.

176
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:11,683
Us three is all there is
in this house.

177
00:27:11,762 --> 00:27:14,959
B-But you must have
passed him out there.

178
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:17,625
You're needin'
this food.

179
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:21,728
Goin' without eatin'
makes you jumpy sometimes.

180
00:27:21,805 --> 00:27:24,899
Maybe you heard
the boards pop or somethin'.

181
00:27:24,975 --> 00:27:27,273
These old houses
creak worse than my knees.

182
00:27:27,344 --> 00:27:31,303
I didn't hear him, Mrs. Thomas.
I saw him.

183
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:37,485
Now, don't talk that way.

184
00:27:37,554 --> 00:27:40,921
I don't sleep so good
as it is.

185
00:27:40,991 --> 00:27:43,755
It's these old houses.
They--

186
00:27:43,827 --> 00:27:47,593
They're big enough so that
you could hide a man in every corner.

187
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:54,194
You just gotta not let
your imagination run away with you.

188
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:56,865
- Are you going out there ?
- Well, of course.

189
00:28:17,627 --> 00:28:20,221
There's nobody there.

190
00:28:21,765 --> 00:28:26,134
Now you just go and eat
that sandwich I made for you.

191
00:28:27,671 --> 00:28:31,334
Don't drink the coffee
if coffee keeps you awake.

192
00:28:31,408 --> 00:28:33,342
It won't.

193
00:28:35,345 --> 00:28:38,337
Coffee never
keeps me awake.

194
00:30:00,864 --> 00:30:03,594
Well, good morning.

195
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:05,931
I heard your alarm.
I knew you'd be up.

196
00:30:06,002 --> 00:30:08,334
- Guess what I got.
- I can't imagine.

197
00:30:08,405 --> 00:30:11,533
Oh,just what it takes
to start the day off right.

198
00:30:11,608 --> 00:30:15,237
I make it in my room. It saves me
havin' to go out and get dressed up.

199
00:30:15,312 --> 00:30:18,475
I guess I had to get dressed
to come over here anyway.

200
00:30:18,548 --> 00:30:20,982
Looks just like what I need.

201
00:30:21,051 --> 00:30:24,487
Well, then, two cups
of coffee comin' up.

202
00:30:28,024 --> 00:30:30,390
Say, uh,

203
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:34,294
I guess you took it wrong last night
about me comin' to your door and all.

204
00:30:34,364 --> 00:30:37,265
I'm not a very sociable person
ordinarily.

205
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:40,064
How can I resist
an inducement like this ?

206
00:30:40,136 --> 00:30:43,435
A what ? Come on,
I don't know all those big words.

207
00:30:43,506 --> 00:30:46,566
I'm just an ordinary guy
who works in a warehouse, that's all.

208
00:30:46,643 --> 00:30:48,577
I make pretty
good money, though.

209
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:51,773
Hey, I got a couple of shots
left over from last night.

210
00:30:51,848 --> 00:30:54,373
- You want a little bit in yours ?
- No, thanks.

211
00:30:54,451 --> 00:30:57,614
It's not the recommended breakfast
for a church organist.

212
00:30:57,687 --> 00:30:59,621
Oh, is that
what you do ?

213
00:30:59,689 --> 00:31:02,317
You mean they pay somebody
to play the organ in church ?

214
00:31:02,392 --> 00:31:04,952
Some churches do.

215
00:31:05,028 --> 00:31:07,292
Hey, I hope you don't
mind about this.

216
00:31:07,364 --> 00:31:09,298
I just didn't know
you were a church woman.

217
00:31:09,366 --> 00:31:12,233
To me a church is just
a place of business.

218
00:31:12,302 --> 00:31:15,499
-Well, that's a funny way to look at it.
-Why ?

219
00:31:15,572 --> 00:31:18,166
People seem shocked because
I took a job in a church,

220
00:31:18,241 --> 00:31:21,108
and I regard it
simply as a job.

221
00:31:21,177 --> 00:31:24,112
I'm a professional organist
and I play for pay, that's all.

222
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:28,014
Thinkin' like that,
don't that give you nightmares ?

223
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:32,453
Strange you should say that.

224
00:31:32,522 --> 00:31:35,923
As a matter of fact--
not for that reason, mind you--

225
00:31:35,992 --> 00:31:39,792
but I had the strangest
feeling last night.

226
00:31:39,863 --> 00:31:43,094
<i>Yeah, I had kind of</i>
<i>a lost night myself.</i>

227
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:46,135
That's funny.

228
00:31:46,202 --> 00:31:49,831
The world is so different
in the daylight.

229
00:31:49,906 --> 00:31:54,240
But in the dark,
your fantasies get so out of hand.

230
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:57,768
But in the daylight,
everything falls back into place again.

231
00:31:59,816 --> 00:32:02,080
Let's have no more nights.

232
00:32:02,152 --> 00:32:05,918
Or let's make them
more interesting, huh ?

233
00:32:08,692 --> 00:32:12,355
- Say, how'd you get
to be a church organist ?
- I studied it in college.

234
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:14,920
I could've gone
to college.

235
00:32:14,998 --> 00:32:16,932
I used to play
pretty good football,

236
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,594
but they wanted me to take
a lot of classes and things, you know ?

237
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:23,969
- They're that way.
- I'm just as smart as the next guy.

238
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,634
But I just didn't dig what
they were teachin' in school.

239
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:30,476
And the thing I hated most
was ''principal products.''

240
00:32:30,547 --> 00:32:32,481
Principal products ?

241
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:36,986
You, you know, like,
''The principal products of Brazil are--''

242
00:32:38,254 --> 00:32:40,188
Oh, geez.

243
00:32:40,256 --> 00:32:43,521
Coffee, beans, snake oil.
You know, like that.

244
00:32:43,593 --> 00:32:46,027
When I was in school,
I couldn't care less.

245
00:32:46,096 --> 00:32:48,360
The only thing
I cared about was girls.

246
00:32:48,431 --> 00:32:51,059
Didn't they offer
a course in that ?

247
00:32:51,134 --> 00:32:53,568
If they would've done that,
I would've graduated.

248
00:32:55,638 --> 00:32:58,607
<i>What's the matter?</i>
<i>Can you still taste the coffee ?</i>

249
00:32:58,675 --> 00:33:01,166
What do you think ?
I'm an alcoholic ?

250
00:33:01,244 --> 00:33:04,270
I just like to start the day off
in a good mood, that's all.

251
00:33:04,347 --> 00:33:06,611
<i>You must be</i>
<i>hilarious by noon.</i>

252
00:33:06,683 --> 00:33:08,981
I'm just the kind of
a guy employers want.

253
00:33:09,052 --> 00:33:11,577
You know,
the happy worker.

254
00:33:11,654 --> 00:33:14,782
Come on. Didn't I make
your morning happier ?

255
00:33:14,858 --> 00:33:17,656
This morning
you're exactly what I needed.

256
00:33:17,727 --> 00:33:21,163
You're gonna need me in the evenin' too.
You just don't know it yet.

257
00:33:21,231 --> 00:33:23,722
I'll rinse off
these cups.

258
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,065
No, no. Just spoils
the flavor for tomorrow.

259
00:33:27,137 --> 00:33:29,071
Thank you
for the coffee.

260
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:31,607
It was unsanitary,
but delicious.

261
00:33:31,674 --> 00:33:33,608
Well, uh,

262
00:33:33,676 --> 00:33:37,407
should've put some of
the germ killer inside.

263
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,176
Well, I hate
to leave so early.

264
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,014
Think you can
get through the door ?

265
00:33:43,086 --> 00:33:45,145
You got the wrong
impression of me.

266
00:33:45,221 --> 00:33:48,213
Well, I meant because
you have so many things to carry.

267
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:51,988
Oh. Like I said,
I hate to leave.

268
00:33:52,061 --> 00:33:55,622
It's been a pleasure, Mr. Linden,
but I'm sure you have to get to work.

269
00:33:55,698 --> 00:33:57,632
- Don't you ?
- Nope.

270
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,134
I have the whole day
free for shopping.

271
00:34:10,013 --> 00:34:13,813
- Does the hem hang right in back ?

272
00:34:13,883 --> 00:34:16,283
We might change
the hemline a little.

273
00:34:16,352 --> 00:34:18,286
The drape
is just fine.

274
00:34:18,354 --> 00:34:20,288
Otherwise
it looks very nice.

275
00:34:20,356 --> 00:34:24,349
I'm sure it isn't very chic to take
the second dress, but I like it.

276
00:34:24,427 --> 00:34:28,193
We alter it a little here
to make it straight all the way around.

277
00:34:28,264 --> 00:34:31,199
Do you want to go back
to your dressing room ?

278
00:35:51,214 --> 00:35:53,148
I like it fine.

279
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,616
I'll have you deliver the dress,
if you don't mind.

280
00:35:57,086 --> 00:35:59,554
I did say
I'd take it.

281
00:36:14,771 --> 00:36:17,365
What's the matter
with her ?

282
00:36:20,243 --> 00:36:22,973
What's the matter
with everyone ?

283
00:36:24,981 --> 00:36:27,677
Why don't
they answer me ?

284
00:38:08,985 --> 00:38:10,919
What is it ?

285
00:38:10,987 --> 00:38:13,717
<i>That man!</i>

286
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:17,055
I didn't mean any harm.
I just stopped to get a drink.

287
00:38:17,126 --> 00:38:20,391
No. No.

288
00:38:20,463 --> 00:38:22,397
It was <i>that</i> man.

289
00:38:23,566 --> 00:38:26,034
<i>That</i> man !

290
00:38:27,403 --> 00:38:29,337
There was someone
else there !

291
00:38:29,405 --> 00:38:31,373
That strange man
was there !

292
00:38:31,441 --> 00:38:33,432
Now, look.
You've had a fright.

293
00:38:33,509 --> 00:38:36,945
Hysteria won't solve anything.
Now control yourself.

294
00:38:37,013 --> 00:38:39,504
Look, I'm Dr. Samuels.

295
00:38:39,582 --> 00:38:42,449
My office is right
across the street there.

296
00:38:42,518 --> 00:38:44,748
You've had a shock.

297
00:38:44,821 --> 00:38:47,415
If you would like my assistance,
I'll be glad to offer it.

298
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,424
Thank you.

299
00:38:49,492 --> 00:38:51,892
- Could I come with you now ?
- Certainly.

300
00:38:51,961 --> 00:38:55,727
I'll take her over to my office.
We'll see that she's all right.

301
00:38:56,899 --> 00:38:58,833
My purse.

302
00:39:09,846 --> 00:39:14,249
It was more than just
not being able to hear anything,

303
00:39:14,317 --> 00:39:16,808
or make contact
with anyone.

304
00:39:16,886 --> 00:39:19,320
It was as though--

305
00:39:20,423 --> 00:39:24,757
as though for a time
I didn't exist.

306
00:39:24,827 --> 00:39:28,388
As though I had
no place in the world,

307
00:39:28,464 --> 00:39:30,955
no part of
the life around me.

308
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:33,661
And then you saw this--

309
00:39:33,736 --> 00:39:36,136
this man ?

310
00:39:36,205 --> 00:39:38,139
<i>Yes.</i>

311
00:39:40,243 --> 00:39:44,077
You'll excuse my back, but I wanted
to get some of that written down.

312
00:39:44,147 --> 00:39:46,479
I must have been
talking for an hour.

313
00:39:46,549 --> 00:39:50,451
Anything else ?
Anything you haven't told me ?

314
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,887
That's all there is.
That's the whole story.

315
00:39:53,956 --> 00:39:56,550
He's been following me.
That's all there is to it.

316
00:39:56,626 --> 00:40:00,687
- It isn't that simple though, is it ?
- What do you mean ?

317
00:40:00,763 --> 00:40:02,754
He could hardly have been
in the park this afternoon,

318
00:40:02,832 --> 00:40:04,766
or one of us men
would have seen him.

319
00:40:04,834 --> 00:40:08,361
And that night in the hallway,
you said yourself the landlady
came up a minute later...

320
00:40:08,437 --> 00:40:10,701
and she didn't see him,
did she ?

321
00:40:10,773 --> 00:40:12,707
What are you
driving at ?

322
00:40:12,775 --> 00:40:16,609
It's been less than a week
since you were in a car
that crashed into the river.

323
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:19,273
How you got out of that
no one seems to know.

324
00:40:19,348 --> 00:40:22,545
But that experience must have been
a serious emotional shock.

325
00:40:22,618 --> 00:40:25,519
You think I imagined all of it,
don't you ? You think I'm insane ?

326
00:40:25,588 --> 00:40:27,954
I didn't say that.
I don't mean that.

327
00:40:28,024 --> 00:40:31,050
I'm a competent person.
If anything, I'm a realist.

328
00:40:31,127 --> 00:40:33,220
I'm not given
to imagining anything.

329
00:40:33,296 --> 00:40:35,230
Hogwash.

330
00:40:35,298 --> 00:40:37,823
All of us
imagine things.

331
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,334
Have you ever heard two men
talking behind your back...

332
00:40:40,403 --> 00:40:43,600
and imagined they were
talking about you ?

333
00:40:43,673 --> 00:40:46,039
Have you never imagined
you saw someone you knew,

334
00:40:46,108 --> 00:40:48,474
and walked up to them and found
they were a perfect stranger ?

335
00:40:48,544 --> 00:40:51,775
- I don't see what this
has to do with it.
- The point is this.

336
00:40:51,847 --> 00:40:54,077
Our imaginations
play tricks on us.

337
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:57,847
They often misinterpret
what we see and hear. Do you agree ?

338
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,945
I suppose so.

339
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:03,822
If that can happen in ordinary times,
go a step further.

340
00:41:03,893 --> 00:41:08,159
Look what can happen in a high fever,
or following a serious emotional shock.

341
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:12,099
It doesn't seem possible
that I could have imagined all of it.

342
00:41:12,168 --> 00:41:15,899
Does this man, this figure,
resemble anyone you've ever known ?

343
00:41:15,972 --> 00:41:18,406
- An acquaintance or your father ?
- No.

344
00:41:18,474 --> 00:41:22,137
- Do you have a boyfriend
here or back home ?
- I have no desire for one.

345
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:25,772
- Never ?
- No.

346
00:41:25,848 --> 00:41:30,410
I'm surprised to find myself
saying that, but it's true.

347
00:41:30,486 --> 00:41:34,115
I have no desire for
the close company of other people.

348
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,125
Have you always
felt this way ?

349
00:41:38,194 --> 00:41:40,128
I-- I don't know.

350
00:41:40,196 --> 00:41:42,664
Don't you want to join
in the things that other people do,

351
00:41:42,732 --> 00:41:44,757
share the experiences
of other people ?

352
00:41:44,834 --> 00:41:48,361
I don't seem capable
of being very close to people.

353
00:41:48,437 --> 00:41:52,396
I do feel that perhaps I'm trying
to reach out for those other things.

354
00:41:52,475 --> 00:41:55,467
Do you feel guilty
wanting them ?

355
00:41:55,544 --> 00:41:57,808
I don't understand you.

356
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,714
I'm not a psychiatrist, and perhaps
I'm being clumsy at all this,

357
00:42:01,784 --> 00:42:05,345
but I am suggesting that perhaps
this figure represents a guilt feeling.

358
00:42:05,421 --> 00:42:07,548
Oh, that's ridiculous !

359
00:42:07,623 --> 00:42:11,616
Maybe. Frankly,
I don't know.

360
00:42:11,694 --> 00:42:13,787
Well, I know one thing.

361
00:42:13,863 --> 00:42:16,297
If my imagination
is playing tricks on me,

362
00:42:16,365 --> 00:42:18,299
I'm going to put
a stop to it.

363
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:21,200
<i>You're a very strong-willed</i>
<i>person, aren't you ?</i>

364
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,329
I survive,
if that's what you mean.

365
00:42:23,406 --> 00:42:27,137
That old pavilion
out by the lake.

366
00:42:27,209 --> 00:42:29,973
Somehow you associate it
with all this, don't you ?

367
00:42:30,046 --> 00:42:34,847
I could go out there.
I could put an end to that too.

368
00:42:36,118 --> 00:42:39,451
- I could go out there--
- Now don't be hasty.

369
00:42:39,522 --> 00:42:43,720
If it is all in my imagination,
I could put a stop to it.

370
00:42:43,793 --> 00:42:46,660
Maybe, but at least someone
should be with you. I can't possibly--

371
00:42:46,729 --> 00:42:49,789
As you say, Doctor,
I'm a person of strong will.

372
00:42:49,865 --> 00:42:52,925
And the time
to go out there is now.

373
00:42:53,002 --> 00:42:56,460
And if I have to,
I can go alone.

374
00:47:35,584 --> 00:47:37,779
Say, uh,

375
00:47:37,853 --> 00:47:40,413
I don't wanna
get turned down again.

376
00:47:40,489 --> 00:47:42,957
I was thinkin' of
askin' you out to dinner.

377
00:47:43,025 --> 00:47:45,289
I stopped for a bite
to eat on the way in.

378
00:47:45,361 --> 00:47:47,795
Anyway, I have to practice
at the church this evening.

379
00:47:47,863 --> 00:47:51,856
Look, uh, how's about if
I picked you up afterward ?

380
00:47:51,934 --> 00:47:54,801
We'll go someplace
and dance or somethin'.

381
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:58,203
I'm sorry.
I'm not much for dancing.

382
00:47:59,908 --> 00:48:01,876
Hey, uh,

383
00:48:01,944 --> 00:48:04,708
do you mind if I
ask you a question ?

384
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:06,839
I won't know
until I hear it.

385
00:48:06,915 --> 00:48:08,849
What are you,
afraid of men ?

386
00:48:08,917 --> 00:48:11,408
No, I'm not
afraid of men.

387
00:48:11,487 --> 00:48:15,947
Well, you seem
sort of cold.

388
00:48:16,025 --> 00:48:19,517
This morning when I brought you
the coffee, you were friendly.

389
00:48:19,595 --> 00:48:22,587
This morning
I needed company.

390
00:48:22,665 --> 00:48:26,101
Well, maybe you'll need
company tonight.

391
00:48:26,168 --> 00:48:29,729
It's better than
walkin' home alone.

392
00:48:29,805 --> 00:48:32,433
Yes, it is.

393
00:48:33,542 --> 00:48:35,840
I should be finished
around 9:00.

394
00:48:35,911 --> 00:48:38,937
- Will that be all right ?
- That's okay by me.

395
00:48:40,015 --> 00:48:41,949
Say, uh,

396
00:48:42,017 --> 00:48:43,951
I'll see you
in church, huh ?

397
00:52:09,157 --> 00:52:12,126
Profane !
Sacrilege !

398
00:52:12,194 --> 00:52:14,958
What are you playing
in this church ?

399
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:19,023
Have you no respect ?
Do you feel no reverence ?

400
00:52:20,469 --> 00:52:24,337
<i>Then I feel sorry for you</i>
<i>and your lack of soul.</i>

401
00:52:24,406 --> 00:52:27,534
This organ,
the music of this church,

402
00:52:27,609 --> 00:52:31,010
these things have meaning
and significance to us.

403
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:34,071
I assumed they did to you.

404
00:52:34,149 --> 00:52:36,481
But without this awareness,

405
00:52:36,551 --> 00:52:40,180
I'm afraid you cannot
be our organist.

406
00:52:40,255 --> 00:52:43,850
In conscience,
I must ask you to resign.

407
00:53:08,116 --> 00:53:10,846
That does not mean that
I am abandoning you,

408
00:53:10,919 --> 00:53:13,353
nor should you turn
your back on the church.

409
00:53:13,422 --> 00:53:16,619
There is help here,
and I urge you to accept it.

410
00:53:46,355 --> 00:53:49,483
Hi, there. I've been waitin'
an awful long time for you.

411
00:53:49,558 --> 00:53:51,856
My car is just over there.
I know the right place to go.

412
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:20,153
What's the matter ?
Don't you drink either ?

413
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:23,123
- Not really.
- Not really.

414
00:54:23,191 --> 00:54:27,184
How else is there if you don't
drink really ? Answer me that, hmm ?

415
00:54:27,262 --> 00:54:30,959
Now me, I not only
drink really,

416
00:54:31,033 --> 00:54:32,967
I really drink.

417
00:54:38,807 --> 00:54:41,298
What's the matter ?
Don't you like the music either ?

418
00:54:41,376 --> 00:54:43,810
- I like it fine.
- You don't like it.

419
00:54:43,879 --> 00:54:45,847
You don't like
to dance,

420
00:54:45,914 --> 00:54:48,712
and you don't
like to drink.

421
00:54:48,784 --> 00:54:51,776
You don't like for a man to
hold you close. That's it, isn't it ?

422
00:54:51,853 --> 00:54:53,878
I didn't say that.

423
00:54:53,955 --> 00:54:56,719
You haven't said
anything all evening.

424
00:54:58,794 --> 00:55:02,389
Why don't I go play that song again,
you like it so much.

425
00:55:07,969 --> 00:55:10,733
Hey,Johnny,
who's the doll ?

426
00:55:10,806 --> 00:55:12,740
Nobody you know, Chicken.

427
00:55:12,808 --> 00:55:14,901
Oh, come on now.
You been holdin' out on me.

428
00:55:14,976 --> 00:55:18,309
That's not the kind of pig
you usually drag around.

429
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:21,713
You quit lickin' your chops.
She's outta your class.

430
00:55:21,783 --> 00:55:24,308
You wanna bet ?

431
00:55:24,386 --> 00:55:26,650
Lay off, huh ?

432
00:55:26,721 --> 00:55:28,712
I got somethin' on
the stove there, man.

433
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:30,724
I'll help you
put it over.

434
00:55:30,792 --> 00:55:34,091
I don't want her to think
I even know creeps like you.

435
00:55:35,564 --> 00:55:38,294
Good luck.

436
00:55:41,069 --> 00:55:43,162
Meet someone
you know ?

437
00:55:43,238 --> 00:55:45,172
Yeah.

438
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,141
He's a...
college fella.

439
00:55:50,212 --> 00:55:54,615
He told me about this girl
that's been wantin' to meet me.

440
00:55:54,683 --> 00:55:58,244
- Wanted me to meet her.
- What'd you tell him ?

441
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,812
I said, how could I ?
You're my date, you know.

442
00:56:06,027 --> 00:56:07,961
Said you, uh,

443
00:56:08,029 --> 00:56:10,691
didn't seem to enjoy
my company much.

444
00:56:10,765 --> 00:56:12,756
Oh, that's not true.

445
00:56:12,834 --> 00:56:16,235
I really appreciate you
taking me out this evening.

446
00:56:16,304 --> 00:56:19,034
I'd had a miserable night
if you hadn't.

447
00:56:20,609 --> 00:56:23,772
Forget it.
Join the party. Drink up.

448
00:56:29,718 --> 00:56:32,812
I paid good money for that stuff.
It ain't poison.

449
00:56:32,888 --> 00:56:36,449
I'm sorry
if I annoy you.

450
00:56:36,525 --> 00:56:38,459
I don't get you.

451
00:56:38,527 --> 00:56:42,793
First you stand me off.
Well, that's okay. That's class.

452
00:56:42,864 --> 00:56:45,697
Figure you got somethin',
you're just holdin' back.

453
00:56:45,767 --> 00:56:48,964
Now everything I say is okay.
You're a mouse.

454
00:56:49,037 --> 00:56:52,598
Yesterday I didn't care.

455
00:56:52,674 --> 00:56:55,006
Tonight I wanna
be with you.

456
00:56:55,076 --> 00:56:57,340
<i>With me,</i>
<i>orjust with anybody?</i>

457
00:56:57,412 --> 00:56:59,380
With you.

458
00:57:04,986 --> 00:57:08,683
Why don't you
thaw out, hmm ?

459
00:57:10,692 --> 00:57:14,856
- Maybe you wanna be alone.
I'll leave you alone.
- <i>No, I don't.</i>

460
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:18,889
I like being with you,
really I do.

461
00:57:18,967 --> 00:57:21,492
I don't want to be
alone tonight.

462
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:23,697
I want to be near you.

463
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:35,015
- You mean that ?
- Yes.

464
00:57:45,527 --> 00:57:48,360
Why don't you and me
get outta here, huh ?

465
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:52,628
You know, my room's only
a couple of feet from yours.

466
00:57:52,701 --> 00:57:56,467
Ain't likely to get
very far from me, are ya ?

467
00:58:14,656 --> 00:58:17,147
- Oh, geez.
- Shh !

468
00:58:17,225 --> 00:58:22,162
-We'll awake Mrs. Thomas.
-Ahh ! That old girl won't hear nothin'.

469
00:58:31,406 --> 00:58:34,341
Honey,

470
00:58:34,409 --> 00:58:38,106
you don't wanna go in there
all by yourself, do you ?

471
00:58:39,247 --> 00:58:43,377
It's dark,
and it's lonely in there.

472
00:58:43,451 --> 00:58:45,942
You don't have to be
alone tonight.

473
00:58:46,021 --> 00:58:50,321
Just let me come in a while.
Let me stay with you, huh ?

474
00:58:50,392 --> 00:58:53,122
Look, you don't wanna
be alone, do ya ?

475
00:58:53,194 --> 00:58:55,128
No.

476
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:08,709
- I'm sorry, I--
- Look, look, honey.

477
00:59:08,777 --> 00:59:13,510
Honey, you asked me in.
You must like me a little, huh ?

478
00:59:41,609 --> 00:59:44,043
What's the matter
with you ?

479
00:59:46,948 --> 00:59:50,179
What's goin' on
around here ?

480
00:59:50,251 --> 00:59:52,412
What's the matter
with you ?

481
00:59:52,487 --> 00:59:56,423
That man's after me. You gotta stop him.
He's after me again.

482
00:59:56,491 --> 00:59:58,618
- I'm gettin' outta here.
- I can't let you go !

483
00:59:58,693 --> 01:00:01,890
Not me, sister.
That's just what I need--

484
01:00:01,963 --> 01:00:04,659
gettin' mixed up with some girl
that's off her rocker.

485
01:00:04,733 --> 01:00:08,669
- I don't wanna be left alone !

486
01:01:00,088 --> 01:01:03,148
What'd you find out, Doctor ?

487
01:01:03,224 --> 01:01:05,488
Not very much,
I'm afraid.

488
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:09,621
I am sure glad
you just happened around.

489
01:01:09,697 --> 01:01:13,565
I was gonna call somebody, but
I was afraid I'd have to pay the bill.

490
01:01:13,635 --> 01:01:16,126
I came on purpose.

491
01:01:16,204 --> 01:01:19,799
I've been thinking about her
ever since she left my office yesterday.

492
01:01:19,874 --> 01:01:22,672
What's she been up to ?

493
01:01:22,744 --> 01:01:25,679
Only the devil knows that.

494
01:01:25,747 --> 01:01:30,548
I heard her movin' things
all around that room all night.

495
01:01:30,618 --> 01:01:33,018
Never heard such goings-on,

496
01:01:33,087 --> 01:01:35,817
and she wouldn't let me
in her room this morning.

497
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:37,915
-<i>She's a strange one.</i>

498
01:01:37,992 --> 01:01:41,257
She absolutely refuses my help.

499
01:01:41,329 --> 01:01:46,323
I can't say that I blame her.
There's something about her
that completely baffles me.

500
01:01:46,401 --> 01:01:50,269
I've urged her to call upon me
if she feels she needs help,
and I hope she will.

501
01:01:50,338 --> 01:01:53,307
I can't let her stay
in this house.

502
01:01:53,374 --> 01:01:55,308
<i>You won't have to worry</i>
<i>about that.</i>

503
01:01:55,376 --> 01:01:59,506
She's determined to leave the city,
and she wants to get away
as soon as possible.

504
01:01:59,581 --> 01:02:02,049
I hope she does leave.

505
01:02:04,853 --> 01:02:06,787
I hope she can.

506
01:02:47,962 --> 01:02:50,829
Decided to leave,
did ya ?

507
01:02:50,899 --> 01:02:52,833
Where ya goin' ?

508
01:02:56,938 --> 01:03:01,204
I can't refund none of your week's rent
when you go off like that.

509
01:03:57,065 --> 01:03:58,999
Sounds like
your transmission.

510
01:03:59,067 --> 01:04:02,059
Can you pull it up
on the rack ?

511
01:04:13,848 --> 01:04:16,339
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

512
01:04:16,417 --> 01:04:21,548
- Will it take long ?
- Well, I have to check it first.
Would you like to get out ?

513
01:04:21,623 --> 01:04:25,059
- May I just sit here ?
- Sure. Suit yourself.

514
01:06:47,769 --> 01:06:51,637
When is the next
eastbound bus ?

515
01:06:51,706 --> 01:06:54,641
When does the next bus leave ?
I must get on it !

516
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:12,722
I want to get out of here.

517
01:07:12,794 --> 01:07:15,729
I want to get away from here.

518
01:07:29,076 --> 01:07:32,671
<i>Eastbound bus,</i>

519
01:07:32,747 --> 01:07:35,511
now loading,

520
01:07:35,583 --> 01:07:37,517
gate nine.

521
01:08:41,849 --> 01:08:44,875
Don't close it ! Wait !
Wait, wait !

522
01:08:44,952 --> 01:08:47,785
Let me in. You've got to let me in.
I gotta get on that train.

523
01:08:47,855 --> 01:08:52,087
I gotta get away from here.
Please ! Please !

524
01:08:56,530 --> 01:09:00,466
You hear me.
You can hear me.

525
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:15,745
Why can't I hear anything ?

526
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:22,422
Will you help me ?
I need your help.

527
01:09:26,761 --> 01:09:29,696
J-Just a moment, please.

528
01:09:46,147 --> 01:09:50,777
Why can't anybody hear me ?

529
01:10:40,968 --> 01:10:44,460
I-I came to you, Doctor,

530
01:10:44,538 --> 01:10:48,804
because you're
my-my last hope.

531
01:10:48,876 --> 01:10:53,643
I-I-If you don't help me,
I-I have to go back there.

532
01:10:53,714 --> 01:10:57,650
He's-He's trying
to take me back somewhere.

533
01:10:59,587 --> 01:11:04,251
Doctor, you've got
to tell me what to do.

534
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:44,929
Her car's still over there, and then
there are footprints leading up to here.

535
01:16:55,008 --> 01:16:57,272
And then nothing.

536
01:17:23,103 --> 01:17:25,037
Okay !

537
01:17:25,105 --> 01:17:29,769
The car is right down there.
Bring it on up.
