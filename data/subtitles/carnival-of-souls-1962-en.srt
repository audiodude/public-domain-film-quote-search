1
00:00:32,459 --> 00:00:36,085
Hey, Joe, drag your foot, boy.
Look what we got here.

2
00:00:36,417 --> 00:00:37,834
Hey, you wanna drag, huh?

3
00:00:37,918 --> 00:00:40,210
Sure.

4
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:41,834
Come on, man. Get ready.

5
00:01:00,584 --> 00:01:02,751
I'll show 'em how to drive. Just watch me.

6
00:03:39,626 --> 00:03:41,793
Sir, as high as this river is right now,

7
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:44,168
and with all the mud and sand
it's carryin'‚

8
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,001
they may never find that car.

9
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:52,959
Uh-uh.

10
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:57,543
Right there.

11
00:03:57,626 --> 00:04:00,043
All right, let's hear your story
about how it happened.

12
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:03,292
- It wasn't our fault, sir.
- Yeah?

13
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:08,084
We were the first ones on the bridge,
and coming a-along following the tracks,

14
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:12,043
and they wanted to get around us, I guess,
and they lost control...

15
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,250
You sure you didn't crowd 'em off?

16
00:04:25,584 --> 00:04:27,043
Three hours.

17
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:30,710
Yeah? Not sure I wanna find that car now.

18
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:33,875
With this sand and with that current,
we may never find 'em.

19
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,918
About all I guess
we can do is keep tryin'.

20
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,626
Look.

21
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,959
Come on. Let's get down there.

22
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:28,252
Why, it's Mary Henry.

23
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:30,418
Are you all right?

24
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:31,835
How'd you get out?

25
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:35,543
Here, put this on.
We'd better get you back to town.

26
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:41,501
What about the other girls?

27
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,626
I don't remember.

28
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,126
Is this like the one
I'll be playing in Utah?

29
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:25,835
It's quite similar.

30
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:28,836
I supervised the installation myself.

31
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:31,210
The accident won't delay
your going, will it?

32
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:33,959
No. I'm leaving this morning.

33
00:08:34,042 --> 00:08:36,626
- There's nothing I can do here.
- That's right.

34
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:40,251
Well, Mary, you'll make
a fine organist for that church.

35
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:42,293
Be very satisfying to you, I think.

36
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:44,251
It's just a job to me.

37
00:08:44,334 --> 00:08:47,960
Well, that's not quite the attitude
for going into church work.

38
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:50,918
I'm not taking the vows.
I'm only going to play the organ.

39
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,292
Oh, you want more than that.

40
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:57,709
Of course it doesn't pay much,
but, well, at least it's a start.

41
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:00,876
Are you driving by Benton
to see your folks?

42
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:04,377
No, I can't. I... I must hurry.

43
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:07,584
I... I've got to leave.
I'm going to drive straight through.

44
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,918
Mary, it takes more than intellect
to be a musician.

45
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,375
Put your soul into it a little, okay?

46
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,626
Good luck, Mary.

47
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:27,876
Stop by and see us
the next time you're in.

48
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:30,793
Thank you, but I'm never coming back.

49
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,417
Can I help you?

50
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:34,751
- Fill it up.
- All right.

51
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:02,375
Be anything else, lady?

52
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:07,626
Could you tell me what that big structure
is back a few miles by the lake?

53
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:09,543
Oh, you mean the old bathhouse.

54
00:14:09,626 --> 00:14:13,335
Yeah, that used to be
a pretty ritzy place in the old days.

55
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:16,792
Then the lake went down
and they made a dance hall out of it.

56
00:14:16,918 --> 00:14:19,001
Then they put those buildings up out there

57
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:22,001
and made some sort of
a carnival there for a while.

58
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:25,959
Ah, that's years ago though.
Just stands out there now.

59
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:27,417
I see.

60
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:34,335
Uh, I have an address here of
a rooming house. Could you direct me?

61
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:38,917
Oh, sure. Why, that's just
right over here a little way.

62
00:14:47,292 --> 00:14:50,334
Been savin' it for you
since I got your letter.

63
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:55,584
Could've rented it yesterday
if I'd wanted.

64
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:59,709
Oh, it... it's fine.
I... It's just about what I expected.

65
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:01,626
I knew you'd like it.

66
00:15:02,584 --> 00:15:05,293
This ain't no regular
roomin' house, you know.

67
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:09,542
I only got you
and Mr. Linden across the hall.

68
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:18,376
Each room's got its own
private bathroom too.

69
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:23,876
You can take all the baths you want.

70
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:26,710
I'm not one to fuss
about things like that.

71
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:29,001
Thank you.
I think I'll be quite comfortable.

72
00:15:29,501 --> 00:15:32,210
Well, hope you'll stay a while.

73
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:35,126
I'm downstairs
in the back part of the house,

74
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:40,334
so if there's anything else you need,
guess it'll have to wait till morning.

75
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:45,876
Night.

76
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:47,793
Good night, Mrs. Thomas.

77
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:48,543
And this, Miss Henry,
is our pride and joy.

78
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:51,793
This was made in the same town
where I've been studying.

79
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:55,126
Of course.
That's where we heard about you.

80
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:57,459
You have found a place to stay?

81
00:16:57,542 --> 00:16:59,959
- Yes, I have a room.
- Good.

82
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:02,793
Well, we hope
you're going to like it here.

83
00:17:02,918 --> 00:17:05,419
We're not the largest church
in this area, of course,

84
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:09,377
but we have a nice congregation.

85
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:12,918
We'll have to have some sort of reception.
They'll want to meet you.

86
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,501
- Couldn't we just skip that?
- Skip that?

87
00:17:16,584 --> 00:17:19,626
I don't suppose
it's an absolute necessity.

88
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:22,751
I don't know what
some of the ladies will say.

89
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:26,043
If they say I'm a fine organist,
that should be enough, shouldn't it?

90
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,834
Well, yes, of course.

91
00:17:28,918 --> 00:17:32,127
We'll let it go at that
for the time being.

92
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:34,835
But, my dear,

93
00:17:34,918 --> 00:17:39,293
you cannot live in isolation
from the human race, you know.

94
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,125
- Mind if I try this now?
- I want you to.

95
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,210
You go right ahead.

96
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:09,667
I'll be next door at the manse,
if you need me.

97
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:28,918
We have an organist
capable of stirring the soul.

98
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,750
What do you see?

99
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,042
Oh. Nothing. Nothing at all.

100
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,792
I've practiced all afternoon
and it's gotten me in a mood.

101
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:34,377
You need some fresh air.

102
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:37,210
I've got to make a call out past the lake.

103
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:39,751
Would you like to come along for the ride?

104
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:42,752
- You know that old pavilion out there?
- Mm-hmm.

105
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:44,876
- Will we pass it?
- Go right by it.

106
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:48,084
- Stop and look at it if you like.
- I would, with you along.

107
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:49,376
Good.

108
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:27,667
This used to be quite a place.

109
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:31,210
- It's been deserted for a long time now.
- Will you take me in?

110
00:20:31,334 --> 00:20:35,293
Goodness no.
It isn't safe out there anymore.

111
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,417
That's why they put up this barrier.

112
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:39,543
Be very easy to step around it.

113
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:44,460
What attraction could
there be for you out there?

114
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:45,792
I'm not sure.

115
00:20:45,876 --> 00:20:48,668
I'm a reasonable person. I don't know.

116
00:20:49,042 --> 00:20:51,084
Maybe I want to satisfy myself

117
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,167
that the place is nothing more
than it appears to be.

118
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:56,959
- Would you take me out there?
- No.

119
00:20:57,042 --> 00:20:59,209
The law has placed it off-limits.

120
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:02,918
Wouldn't be very seemly for
a minister to break the law, would it?

121
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,709
No. Maybe I can come back
some other time.

122
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,333
Shall we go along now?

123
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:38,834
Ah, I thought that'd be you.

124
00:21:38,918 --> 00:21:40,252
Good evening.

125
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:44,918
That organ playin' must take a long time.
You've been gone most the whole day.

126
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,250
I went for a long drive in the country
with my new boss, an elderly minister.

127
00:21:51,334 --> 00:21:53,417
Oh, ho.

128
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:56,002
That must have been a kick in the head.

129
00:21:57,501 --> 00:22:00,584
I learned that
from my other boarder, Mr. Linden.

130
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:03,001
Did you get your supper?

131
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,333
Oh, I forgot.

132
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:07,918
Well, this ain't no boardinghouse,

133
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,292
but I got some coffee
and sandwich makings left.

134
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,792
I could bring you some up after a while.

135
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:17,460
Good. I'll be taking one of those baths
you're so generous with.

136
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:19,126
Take as many as you want.

137
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:22,376
I ain't one to make a fuss
about a thing like that.

138
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:11,417
Come in, Mrs. Thomas.

139
00:23:12,626 --> 00:23:14,668
Oh, uh, just a minute.

140
00:23:35,584 --> 00:23:37,543
I thought you were Mrs. Thomas!

141
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,834
Yeah, I, uh...
I wondered when you asked me in.

142
00:23:41,209 --> 00:23:43,668
I'm John Linden.
I'm your neighbor across the hall.

143
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:46,543
- Nice to meet you. Would you excuse...
- Hey, I, uh...

144
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:49,418
- I was just wondering...
- Just stand right there.

145
00:24:15,918 --> 00:24:18,460
I forgot to introduce myself.
I'm Mary Henry.

146
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,251
Yeah, I know.

147
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:24,459
I, uh... I heard you tell Mrs. Thomas
you haven't ate anything yet, huh?

148
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:29,043
I just thought, bein' neighborly and all-
I haven't eaten anything either.

149
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:32,084
I just thought I'd ask you out to dinner.

150
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:33,918
That's very thoughtful,
but I can't accept.

151
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I know we haven't met or anything yet,
but I just thought...

152
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:39,333
I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse me.

153
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:43,542
Look, there's a real nice restaurant
right down the street, and I thought-

154
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:46,543
I'm the kind of guy
who doesn't like to eat by himself.

155
00:24:46,626 --> 00:24:49,127
I've made arrangements
to eat in my room tonight.

156
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:53,209
Hey, if, uh, you change your mind,
just holler.

157
00:24:56,876 --> 00:24:58,876
Looks kind of lonesome in here.

158
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:01,043
Good night, Mr. Linden.

159
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:25,876
Miss Henry?

160
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,626
It's Mrs. Thomas.

161
00:26:39,751 --> 00:26:40,876
Hmm.

162
00:26:46,626 --> 00:26:48,751
Who's the man in the hall?

163
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,001
The...

164
00:26:52,334 --> 00:26:56,584
Oh, you must mean Mr. Linden.

165
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:59,251
He has the room across the hall.

166
00:26:59,334 --> 00:27:02,584
No. I mean the other one.

167
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,584
There is no other.

168
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:09,334
Me and you and Mr. Linden.

169
00:27:09,417 --> 00:27:11,959
Us three is all there is in this house.

170
00:27:12,042 --> 00:27:14,334
B-But you must have
passed him out there.

171
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,501
You're needin' this food.

172
00:27:18,042 --> 00:27:22,042
Goin' without eatin'
makes you jumpy sometimes.

173
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:25,084
Maybe you heard
the boards pop or somethin'.

174
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:27,584
These old houses
creak worse than my knees.

175
00:27:27,709 --> 00:27:31,709
I didn't hear him, Mrs. Thomas. I saw him.

176
00:27:34,459 --> 00:27:36,377
Now, don't talk that way.

177
00:27:37,918 --> 00:27:40,043
I don't sleep so good as it is.

178
00:27:41,334 --> 00:27:44,085
It's these old houses. They...

179
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:48,126
They're big enough so that
you could hide a man in every corner.

180
00:27:51,042 --> 00:27:54,459
You just gotta not let
your imagination run away with you.

181
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:57,043
- Are you going out there?
- Well, of course.

182
00:28:17,876 --> 00:28:20,001
There's nobody there.

183
00:28:22,542 --> 00:28:26,625
Now you just go
and eat that sandwich I made for you.

184
00:28:27,918 --> 00:28:31,502
Don't drink the coffee
if coffee keeps you awake.

185
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:32,959
It won't.

186
00:28:36,292 --> 00:28:38,751
Coffee never keeps me awake.

187
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:03,334
Well, good morning.

188
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,167
I heard your alarm. I knew you'd be up.

189
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,500
- Guess what I got.
- I can't imagine.

190
00:30:08,584 --> 00:30:11,834
Oh, just what it takes
to start the day off right.

191
00:30:11,918 --> 00:30:15,460
I make it in my room.
It saves me havin' to get dressed up.

192
00:30:15,584 --> 00:30:18,751
I guess I had to get dressed
to come over here anyway.

193
00:30:18,834 --> 00:30:20,959
Oh! It looks just like what I need.

194
00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:24,876
Well, then two cups of coffee comin' up.

195
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,834
Say, uh,

196
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:34,585
I guess you took it wrong last night
about me comin' to your door and all.

197
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:37,626
I'm not a very sociable person ordinarily.

198
00:30:37,709 --> 00:30:39,959
How can I resist an inducement like this?

199
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:41,543
A what?

200
00:30:41,626 --> 00:30:43,793
Come on. I don't know all those big words.

201
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:46,918
I'm just an ordinary guy
who works in a warehouse, that's all.

202
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,709
I make pretty good money though.

203
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:49,875
Hey.

204
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:54,042
I got a couple of shots left over from
last night. Want a little bit in yours?

205
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:57,876
No, thanks. It's not the recommended
breakfast for a church organist.

206
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,834
Oh, is that what you do?

207
00:30:59,918 --> 00:31:02,544
You mean they pay somebody
to play the organ in church?

208
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:04,502
Some churches do.

209
00:31:05,417 --> 00:31:07,417
Hey, I hope you don't mind about this.

210
00:31:07,501 --> 00:31:09,668
I just didn't know
you were a church woman.

211
00:31:09,751 --> 00:31:12,585
To me a church is just
a place of business.

212
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:15,792
- Well, that's a funny way to look at it.
- Why?

213
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:18,502
People seem shocked because
I took a job in a church,

214
00:31:18,584 --> 00:31:21,460
and I regard it simply as a job.

215
00:31:21,542 --> 00:31:24,418
I'm a professional organist
and I play for pay, that's all.

216
00:31:24,501 --> 00:31:27,835
Thinkin' like that,
don't that give you nightmares?

217
00:31:29,709 --> 00:31:32,001
Strange you should say that.

218
00:31:32,584 --> 00:31:35,918
As a matter of fact...
not for that reason, mind you...

219
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,792
but I had
the strangest feeling last night.

220
00:31:39,918 --> 00:31:43,252
Yeah, I had kind of a lost night myself.

221
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:45,126
That's funny.

222
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,959
The world is so different in the daylight.

223
00:31:49,918 --> 00:31:53,502
But in the dark,
your fantasies get so out of hand.

224
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:57,876
But in the daylight,
everything falls back into place again.

225
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,835
Let's have no more nights.

226
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,126
Or let's make them more interesting, huh?

227
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:10,709
Say, how'd you get to be
a church organist?

228
00:32:10,792 --> 00:32:12,710
I studied it in college.

229
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:14,418
I could've gone to college.

230
00:32:15,042 --> 00:32:16,709
I used to play pretty good football,

231
00:32:16,792 --> 00:32:19,710
but they wanted me
to take a lot of classes and things.

232
00:32:19,834 --> 00:32:23,710
- They're that way.
- I'm just as smart as the next guy.

233
00:32:24,334 --> 00:32:27,001
But I just didn't dig
what they were teachin' in school.

234
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:31,333
And the thing I hated most
was "principal products."

235
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:32,751
Principal products?

236
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:37,168
You know, like, uh,
"The principal products of Brazil are..."

237
00:32:38,209 --> 00:32:39,668
Oh, geez.

238
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,043
Coffee beans, snake oil.
You know, like that.

239
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:46,208
When I was in school,
I couldn't care less.

240
00:32:46,292 --> 00:32:48,417
The only thing I cared about was girls.

241
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:50,460
Didn't they offer a course in that?

242
00:32:50,542 --> 00:32:53,376
If they would've done that,
I would've graduated.

243
00:32:55,501 --> 00:32:58,043
What's the matter?
Can you still taste the coffee?

244
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:00,917
Come on.
What do you think, I'm an alcoholic?

245
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:04,417
I just like to start the day off
in a good mood, that's all.

246
00:33:04,501 --> 00:33:06,876
You must be hilarious by noon.

247
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:11,168
I'm just the kind of a guy employers want.
You know, the happy worker.

248
00:33:11,918 --> 00:33:14,960
Come on.
Didn't I make your morning happier?

249
00:33:15,042 --> 00:33:17,709
This morning you're exactly what I needed.

250
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:21,543
You're gonna need me in the evenin' too.
You just don't know it yet.

251
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,959
I'll rinse off these cups.

252
00:33:24,042 --> 00:33:27,292
Ah, no, no.
Just spoils the flavor for tomorrow.

253
00:33:27,876 --> 00:33:29,377
Well, thank you for the coffee.

254
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:31,960
It was unsanitary, but delicious.

255
00:33:32,042 --> 00:33:36,626
Well, uh, should've put some of
the germ killer inside.

256
00:33:37,709 --> 00:33:40,460
Well, I hate to leave so early.

257
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:43,084
Think you can get through the door?

258
00:33:43,584 --> 00:33:45,502
You got the wrong impression of me.

259
00:33:45,584 --> 00:33:48,460
Well, I meant because
you have so many things to carry.

260
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:52,501
Oh. Like I said, I hate to leave.

261
00:33:52,584 --> 00:33:56,293
It's been a pleasure, Mr. Linden,
but I'm sure you have to get to work.

262
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:57,625
- Don't you?
- Nope.

263
00:33:57,709 --> 00:34:00,627
I have the whole day free for shopping.

264
00:34:10,834 --> 00:34:14,168
Does the hem hang right in back?

265
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,333
We might change the hemline a little.

266
00:34:16,417 --> 00:34:18,293
The drape is just fine.

267
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:20,167
Otherwise it looks very nice.

268
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:24,375
I'm sure it isn't very chic to take
the second dress, but I like it.

269
00:34:24,501 --> 00:34:28,085
We alter it a little here
to make it straight all the way around.

270
00:34:28,542 --> 00:34:30,959
Do you want to go back
to your dressing room?

271
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:56,001
I like it fine. I believe I'll have you
deliver the dress, if you don't mind.

272
00:35:57,334 --> 00:35:59,501
I did say I'd take it.

273
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:17,001
What's the matter with her?

274
00:36:20,459 --> 00:36:22,584
What's the matter with everyone?

275
00:36:26,042 --> 00:36:28,001
Why don't they answer me?

276
00:38:10,334 --> 00:38:11,334
What is it?

277
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:12,500
That man!

278
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:17,458
I didn't mean any harm.
I just stopped to get a drink.

279
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:20,625
No. No.

280
00:38:20,709 --> 00:38:22,460
It was that man.

281
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:25,418
That man!

282
00:38:27,834 --> 00:38:29,501
There was someone else there!

283
00:38:29,584 --> 00:38:31,584
That strange man was there!

284
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:33,585
Now, look. You've had a fright.

285
00:38:33,667 --> 00:38:37,084
Hysteria won't solve anything.
Now control yourself.

286
00:38:37,209 --> 00:38:39,751
Look, I'm Dr. Samuels.

287
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:42,793
My office is right across
the street there.

288
00:38:42,876 --> 00:38:44,502
You've had a shock.

289
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:47,835
If you would like my assistance,
I'll be glad to offer it.

290
00:38:47,918 --> 00:38:49,460
Thank you.

291
00:38:49,542 --> 00:38:51,751
- Could I come with you now?
- Certainly.

292
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:55,542
I'll take her over to my office.
We'll see that she's all right.

293
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:58,792
MY purse.

294
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:13,584
It was more than just
not being able to hear anything,

295
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:16,834
or make contact with anyone.

296
00:39:17,334 --> 00:39:18,918
It was as though...

297
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:23,876
as though for a time I didn't exist.

298
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,876
As though I had no place in the world,

299
00:39:28,918 --> 00:39:31,419
no part of the life around me.

300
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:36,042
And then you saw this... this man?

301
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:38,001
Yes.

302
00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:44,501
You'll excuse my back, but I wanted
to get some of that written down.

303
00:39:44,584 --> 00:39:46,834
I must have been talking for an hour.

304
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:50,377
Anything else?
Anything you haven't told me?

305
00:39:50,918 --> 00:39:54,210
That's all there is.
That's the whole story.

306
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:56,876
He's been following me.
That's all there is to it.

307
00:39:56,959 --> 00:39:59,543
It isn't that simple though, is it?

308
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:01,125
What do you mean?

309
00:40:01,209 --> 00:40:03,376
He couldn't have been
in the park this afternoon,

310
00:40:03,459 --> 00:40:05,377
or one of us men would've seen him.

311
00:40:05,459 --> 00:40:06,918
And that night in the hallway,

312
00:40:07,292 --> 00:40:11,251
you said yourself the landlady came up
a minute later, and she didn't see him?

313
00:40:11,334 --> 00:40:12,918
What are you driving at?

314
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,083
It's been less than a week since you
were in a car that crashed into the river.

315
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:19,834
How you got out of that
no one seems to know.

316
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,794
But that experience must have been
a serious emotional shock.

317
00:40:22,876 --> 00:40:26,001
You think I imagined all of it, don't you?
You think I'm insane?

318
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:28,375
I didn't say that. I don't mean that.

319
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:31,418
I'm a competent person.
If anything, I'm a realist.

320
00:40:31,501 --> 00:40:33,710
I'm not given to imagining anything.

321
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,710
Hogwash.

322
00:40:35,792 --> 00:40:38,167
All of us imagine things.

323
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,667
Have you ever heard two men
talking behind your back

324
00:40:40,792 --> 00:40:42,959
and imagined they were talking about you?

325
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:46,084
Have you never imagined
you saw someone you knew,

326
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:49,085
and walked up to them and found
they were a perfect stranger?

327
00:40:49,167 --> 00:40:52,501
- I don't see what this has to do with it.
- The point is this.

328
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:54,418
Our imaginations play tricks on us.

329
00:40:54,501 --> 00:40:58,252
They often misinterpret
what we see and hear. Do you agree?

330
00:40:58,334 --> 00:41:00,293
I suppose so.

331
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:04,167
If that can happen in ordinary times,
go a step further.

332
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:08,625
Look what can happen in a high fever,
or following a serious emotional shock.

333
00:41:08,709 --> 00:41:12,418
It doesn't seem possible
that I could have imagined all of it.

334
00:41:12,501 --> 00:41:16,252
Does this man, this figure,
resemble anyone you've ever known?

335
00:41:16,334 --> 00:41:18,543
- An acquaintance, or your father?
- No.

336
00:41:18,626 --> 00:41:22,709
- Have a boyfriend here or back home?
- No, no desire for one.

337
00:41:22,834 --> 00:41:25,126
- Never?
- No.

338
00:41:26,292 --> 00:41:30,876
I'm surprised to find myself
saying that, but it's true.

339
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:34,460
I have no desire for
the close company of other people.

340
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:36,709
Have you always felt this way?

341
00:41:38,876 --> 00:41:40,460
I... I don't know.

342
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:43,460
Don't you want to join
in the things that other people do,

343
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,251
share the experiences of other people?

344
00:41:45,334 --> 00:41:48,709
I don't seem capable
of being very close to people.

345
00:41:48,792 --> 00:41:52,834
I do feel that perhaps I'm trying
to reach out for those other things.

346
00:41:52,918 --> 00:41:55,127
Do you feel guilty wanting them?

347
00:41:56,042 --> 00:41:58,167
I don't understand you.

348
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:02,084
I'm not a psychiatrist, and perhaps
I'm being clumsy at all this,

349
00:42:02,167 --> 00:42:05,793
but I am suggesting that perhaps
this figure represents a guilt feeling.

350
00:42:05,918 --> 00:42:07,627
Oh, that's ridiculous!

351
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:10,917
Maybe. Frankly, I don't know.

352
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:14,208
Well, I know one thing.

353
00:42:14,292 --> 00:42:18,667
If my imagination is playing tricks on me,
I'm going to put a stop to it.

354
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:21,627
You're a very strong-willed person,
aren't you?

355
00:42:21,709 --> 00:42:23,751
I survive, if that's what you mean.

356
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:27,500
That old pavilion out by the lake.

357
00:42:27,584 --> 00:42:30,418
Somehow you associate it
with all this, don't you?

358
00:42:31,209 --> 00:42:35,251
I could go out there.
I could put an end to that too.

359
00:42:36,542 --> 00:42:39,084
- I could go out there...
- Now don't be hasty.

360
00:42:39,876 --> 00:42:44,168
If it is all in my imagination,
I could put a stop to it.

361
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:47,126
Maybe. But at least someone
should be with you. I can't possibly...

362
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:50,250
As you say, Doctor,
I'm a person of strong will.

363
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:53,460
And the time to go out there is now.

364
00:42:53,542 --> 00:42:57,043
And if I have to, I can go alone.

365
00:47:36,042 --> 00:47:37,417
Say, uh,

366
00:47:38,542 --> 00:47:40,917
I don't wanna get turned down again.

367
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,542
I was thinkin'
of askin' you out to dinner.

368
00:47:43,626 --> 00:47:46,001
I stopped for a bite to eat on the way.

369
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:49,834
Anyway, I have to practice
at the church this evening.

370
00:47:49,918 --> 00:47:52,293
Look, uh, how's about if
I pick you up afterward?

371
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:55,209
We'll go someplace
and dance or somethin'.

372
00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:58,210
I'm sorry. I'm not much for dancing.

373
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:02,375
Uh, hey, uh,

374
00:48:02,792 --> 00:48:05,251
you mind if I ask you a question?

375
00:48:05,334 --> 00:48:07,334
I won't know until I hear it.

376
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:09,168
What, are you afraid of men?

377
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:11,751
No, I'm not afraid of men.

378
00:48:11,834 --> 00:48:15,752
Well, you seem sort of cold.

379
00:48:16,542 --> 00:48:20,001
This morning when I brought you
the coffee, you were friendly.

380
00:48:20,125 --> 00:48:22,167
This morning I needed company.

381
00:48:23,209 --> 00:48:25,835
Well, maybe you'll need company tonight.

382
00:48:26,542 --> 00:48:28,876
It's better than walkin' home alone.

383
00:48:30,334 --> 00:48:33,126
Yes, it is.

384
00:48:34,083 --> 00:48:36,208
I should be finished around 9:00.

385
00:48:36,292 --> 00:48:39,168
- Will that be all right?
- That's okay by me.

386
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:44,418
Say, uh, I'll see you in church, huh?

387
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:12,585
Profane! Sacrilege!

388
00:52:12,667 --> 00:52:15,459
What are you playing in this church?

389
00:52:15,542 --> 00:52:19,501
Have you no respect?
Do you feel no reverence?

390
00:52:20,876 --> 00:52:24,835
Then I feel sorry for you
and your lack of soul.

391
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:27,959
This organ, the music of this church,

392
00:52:28,042 --> 00:52:31,417
these things have meaning
and significance to us.

393
00:52:31,542 --> 00:52:33,959
I assumed they did to you.

394
00:52:34,709 --> 00:52:36,918
But without this awareness,

395
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,459
I'm afraid you cannot be our organist.

396
00:52:40,792 --> 00:52:44,209
In conscience, I must ask you to resign.

397
00:53:08,501 --> 00:53:11,210
That does not mean
that I am abandoning you,

398
00:53:11,334 --> 00:53:13,501
nor should you turn
your back on the church.

399
00:53:13,584 --> 00:53:16,751
There is help here,
and I urge you to accept it.

400
00:53:46,667 --> 00:53:49,585
Well, hi there. I've been waitin'
an awful long time for you.

401
00:53:49,667 --> 00:53:52,334
My car's over there.
I know the right place to go.

402
00:54:18,501 --> 00:54:20,626
What's the matter? Don't you drink either?

403
00:54:20,709 --> 00:54:23,543
- Not really.
- Not really.

404
00:54:23,626 --> 00:54:26,835
How else is there if you don't
drink really? Answer me that, hmm?

405
00:54:27,751 --> 00:54:33,252
Now me, I not only drink really,
I really drink.

406
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:41,792
What's the matter?
Don't you like the music either?

407
00:54:41,876 --> 00:54:44,251
- I like it fine.
- You don't like it.

408
00:54:44,334 --> 00:54:48,876
You don't like to dance,
and you don't like to drink.

409
00:54:48,959 --> 00:54:52,293
You don't like for a man
to hold you close. That's it, isn't it?

410
00:54:52,375 --> 00:54:56,042
- I didn't say that.
- You haven't said anything all evening.

411
00:54:59,292 --> 00:55:02,793
Why don't I go play that song again,
you like it so much.

412
00:55:08,459 --> 00:55:11,126
Hey, Johnny, who's the doll?

413
00:55:11,209 --> 00:55:12,751
Nobody you know, Chip.

414
00:55:12,834 --> 00:55:15,293
Oh, come on now.
You been holdin' out on me.

415
00:55:15,375 --> 00:55:18,750
That's not the kind of pig
you usually drag around.

416
00:55:18,876 --> 00:55:22,168
You quit lickin' your chops.
She's outta your class.

417
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:23,792
You wanna bet?

418
00:55:24,876 --> 00:55:26,460
Lay off, huh?

419
00:55:27,417 --> 00:55:30,834
- I got somethin' on the stove there, man.
- I'll help you put it over.

420
00:55:30,918 --> 00:55:34,293
I don't want her to think
I even know creeps like you.

421
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,501
Good luck.

422
00:55:41,542 --> 00:55:43,625
Meet someone you know?

423
00:55:43,709 --> 00:55:45,001
Yeah.

424
00:55:45,417 --> 00:55:48,751
He's a... college fella.

425
00:55:50,334 --> 00:55:53,751
He told me about this girl
that's been wantin' to meet me.

426
00:55:55,209 --> 00:55:58,793
- Wanted me to meet her.
- What'd you tell him?

427
00:55:58,918 --> 00:56:02,168
I said, how could I?
You're my date, you know.

428
00:56:06,751 --> 00:56:11,085
Said you, uh, didn't seem
to enjoy my company much.

429
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:13,209
Oh, that's not true.

430
00:56:13,292 --> 00:56:16,667
I really appreciate
you taking me out this evening.

431
00:56:16,751 --> 00:56:19,335
I'd had a miserable night if you hadn't.

432
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:24,168
Ah. Forget it. Come on, here.
Join the party. Drink up.

433
00:56:30,209 --> 00:56:33,251
I paid good money for that stuff.
It ain't poison.

434
00:56:33,334 --> 00:56:35,876
I'm sorry if I annoy you.

435
00:56:37,417 --> 00:56:39,542
You know, I don't get you.

436
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:43,251
First you stand me off.
Well, that's okay. That's class.

437
00:56:43,334 --> 00:56:45,793
Figure you got somethin',
you're just holdin' back.

438
00:56:46,292 --> 00:56:49,459
Now everything I say is okay.
You're a mouse.

439
00:56:50,209 --> 00:56:52,459
Yesterday I didn't care.

440
00:56:53,292 --> 00:56:55,375
Tonight I wanna be with you.

441
00:56:55,459 --> 00:56:57,834
With me, or just with anybody?

442
00:56:57,918 --> 00:56:59,210
With you.

443
00:57:05,459 --> 00:57:08,377
Why don't you thaw out, hmm?

444
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:15,376
- You wanna be alone. I'll leave you alone.
- No, I don't. No, I...

445
00:57:15,876 --> 00:57:18,627
I like being with you, really I do.

446
00:57:19,375 --> 00:57:21,417
I don't want to be alone tonight.

447
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,834
I want to be near you.

448
00:57:32,417 --> 00:57:35,459
- Do you mean that?
- Yes.

449
00:57:45,959 --> 00:57:48,334
Why don't you and me
get outta here, huh?

450
00:57:48,876 --> 00:57:52,168
You know, my room's only
a couple of feet from yours.

451
00:57:52,959 --> 00:57:55,959
Ain't likely to get
very far from me, are ya?

452
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:17,668
- Oh, geez.
- Shh!

453
00:58:17,751 --> 00:58:20,710
- You'll wake Mrs. Thomas.
- Ah, that old girl lives in the back.

454
00:58:20,792 --> 00:58:23,543
She won't hear nothin'.

455
00:58:31,918 --> 00:58:33,210
Honey...

456
00:58:34,959 --> 00:58:38,084
You don't wanna go in there
all by yourself, do you?

457
00:58:39,501 --> 00:58:42,626
It's dark, and it's lonely in there.

458
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:46,584
You don't have to be alone tonight.

459
00:58:46,667 --> 00:58:50,293
Just let me come in a while.
Let me stay with you, huh?

460
00:58:51,292 --> 00:58:53,626
Look, you don't wanna be alone, do ya?

461
00:58:53,709 --> 00:58:55,001
No.

462
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:09,167
- I'm sorry, I...
- Look, look, honey.

463
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:13,959
Honey, you asked me in.
You must like me a little, huh?

464
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:44,042
Hey, what's the matter with you?

465
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:49,460
What's goin' on around here?

466
00:59:50,876 --> 00:59:52,752
What's the matter with you?

467
00:59:52,834 --> 00:59:54,752
That man's after me.

468
00:59:54,834 --> 00:59:56,752
You gotta stop him! He's after me again.

469
00:59:56,834 --> 00:59:59,126
- I'm gettin' outta here.
- You don't have to go!

470
00:59:59,209 --> 01:00:02,418
Not me, sister. That's just what I need,

471
01:00:02,501 --> 01:00:05,085
gettin' mixed up with some girl
that's off her rocker!

472
01:00:05,167 --> 01:00:09,376
I don't wanna be left alone!

473
01:01:00,542 --> 01:01:02,542
What'd you find out, Doctor?

474
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:05,460
Not very much, I'm afraid.

475
01:01:06,042 --> 01:01:09,376
I am sure glad you just happened around.

476
01:01:10,042 --> 01:01:14,042
I was gonna call somebody,
but I was afraid I'd have to pay the bill.

477
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:16,084
I came on purpose.

478
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:20,209
I've been thinking about her
ever since she left my office yesterday.

479
01:01:20,292 --> 01:01:22,043
What's she been up to?

480
01:01:22,125 --> 01:01:25,709
Only the devil knows that.

481
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:30,959
I heard her movin' things
all around that room all night.

482
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:33,500
Never heard such goings-on.

483
01:01:33,584 --> 01:01:36,168
And she wouldn't let me
in her room this morning.

484
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:38,417
- She's a strange one.
- Mmm.

485
01:01:38,501 --> 01:01:41,085
She absolutely refuses my help.

486
01:01:41,667 --> 01:01:43,334
I can't say that I blame her.

487
01:01:43,417 --> 01:01:46,709
There's something about her
that completely baffles me.

488
01:01:46,792 --> 01:01:51,334
I've urged her to call upon me if she
feels she needs help, and I hope she will.

489
01:01:51,792 --> 01:01:54,042
I can't let her stay in this house.

490
01:01:54,125 --> 01:01:55,834
You won't have to worry about that.

491
01:01:55,918 --> 01:01:57,794
She's determined to leave the city,

492
01:01:57,876 --> 01:02:00,585
and she wants to get away
as soon as possible.

493
01:02:00,667 --> 01:02:02,834
I hope she does leave.

494
01:02:05,167 --> 01:02:07,292
I hope she can.

495
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:51,084
Decided to leave, did ya?

496
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:52,751
Where ya goin'?

497
01:02:57,459 --> 01:03:01,668
I can't refund none of your week's rent
when you go off like that.

498
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,125
Sounds like your transmission.
Can you pull it up on the rack?

499
01:04:14,501 --> 01:04:16,002
Okay, fine.

500
01:04:16,959 --> 01:04:19,626
- Will it take long?
- Well, I have to check it first.

501
01:04:19,751 --> 01:04:21,418
Would you like to get out?

502
01:04:22,209 --> 01:04:25,751
- May I just sit here?
- Sure. Suit yourself.

503
01:06:48,292 --> 01:06:50,334
When is the next eastbound bus?

504
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:55,042
When does the next bus leave?
I must get on it!

505
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:13,043
I want to get out of here.

506
01:07:13,584 --> 01:07:16,335
I want to get away from here.

507
01:07:29,959 --> 01:07:35,084
<i>Eastbound bus, now loading,</i>

508
01:07:36,292 --> 01:07:38,084
<i>gate nine.</i>

509
01:08:42,417 --> 01:08:45,417
Don't close it! Wait! Wait, wait!

510
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:48,335
You've gotta let me in.
I gotta get on that train.

511
01:08:48,417 --> 01:08:52,335
I gotta get away from here.
Please! Please!

512
01:08:57,250 --> 01:09:00,959
You hear me. You can hear me.

513
01:09:13,209 --> 01:09:15,459
<i>Why can't I hear anything?</i>

514
01:09:19,918 --> 01:09:22,585
Will you help me? I need your help.

515
01:09:27,042 --> 01:09:29,042
J-Just a moment, please.

516
01:09:46,626 --> 01:09:50,876
Why can't anybody hear me?

517
01:10:41,542 --> 01:10:44,792
I... I came to you, Doctor,

518
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:48,709
because you're my... my last hope.

519
01:10:49,209 --> 01:10:54,085
I... I... If you don't help me,
I... I have to go back there.

520
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:58,417
He's... He's trying
to take me back somewhere.

521
01:11:00,292 --> 01:11:04,584
Doctor, you've got to tell me what to do.

522
01:16:40,584 --> 01:16:42,667
Her car's still over there,

523
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,125
and then there are footprints
leading up to here.

524
01:16:55,667 --> 01:16:57,917
And then nothing.

525
01:17:23,918 --> 01:17:25,335
Okay!

526
01:17:25,667 --> 01:17:29,501
The Buick's right down there.
Bring it on up.
