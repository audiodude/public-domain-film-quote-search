00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:16,202
(chattering)

2
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:18,705
MAN: Wait a minute. Copyboy!

3
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:23,418
- Make it snappy and hurry back.
- Where's the rest of this story?

4
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:25,170
<i>- Morning Post.
- Morning Post.</i>

5
00:01:25,253 --> 00:01:27,964
- City desk? Just a moment. I'll connect you.
- Just a moment, please.

6
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:30,633
If anybody asks for me,
I'm down at the courthouse.

7
00:01:30,717 --> 00:01:33,052
<i>- Morning Post.
- Elevator! Going down!</i>

8
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:40,810
- Hello, Hildy.
- Oh, hi, Skinny.

9
00:01:40,894 --> 00:01:43,605
- Hello, Ruth. Hello, Maisie.
- Hello, Hildy!

10
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:46,107
- Tell me, is the lord of the universe in?
- Yes, he's in.

11
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:48,777
- In a bad humor.
- Somebody must have stolen the crown jewels.

12
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,321
- Shall we announce you?
- Oh, no, no, <i>I'll</i> blow my own horn.

13
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:54,824
He's in, Bruce. You'd better wait here.
I'll be back in ten minutes.

14
00:01:54,908 --> 00:01:57,869
Even ten minutes is a long time
to be away from you.

15
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:01,247
- What did you say?
- Huh?

16
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:03,458
- Well -
- Go on.

17
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,586
- Uh - (chuckles)
- Well, go ahead.

18
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:10,048
I just said even ten minutes
is a long time to be away from you.

19
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:14,052
I heard you the first time. I like it.
That's why I asked you to say it again.

20
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:18,264
I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman
I'm going in to see did very little spoiling.

21
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:21,267
I'd like to spoil him just once.
Sure you don't want me to go in with you?

22
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:23,603
- No, I can handle it.
- If things get rough, remember I'm here.

23
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:25,688
<i>I'll</i> come a-runnin', partner.

24
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:28,566
- Well, hello, Jim.
- Well, hello, Hildy.

25
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,568
- How are you?
- Hi, Hildy! Welcome back!

26
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:34,531
- Hello, Hildy. How ya been?
- Hi, Hildy.

27
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:37,116
Oh, hello, Beatrice.
How's “Advice to the Lovelorn”?

28
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,619
- Fine. My cat just had kittens again.
- It's your own fault.

29
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:41,788
- Hello, Hildy. Glad to see you back.
- Glad to see you.

30
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:45,583
- Hi, Tim. Mildred, he still around?
- Oh, hello, Hildy.

31
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:48,670
- (buzzing)
- MAN: A little more around the chin, boss.

32
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,799
- What do ya want?
- Your ex-wife is here. Do you want to see her?

33
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:56,761
Well... Well, hello, Hildy.

34
00:02:56,845 --> 00:02:59,138
- Hello, Walter.
- Hi, Hildy.

35
00:02:59,222 --> 00:03:01,808
Oh, hello, Louie.
How's the fixed slot machine king?

36
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:05,270
Oh, I ain't doin' that no more.
I'm retired. Ya know what I mean?

37
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:07,272
- Say, Walter - Hello, Hildy.
- I'm busy, Duffy.

38
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:09,274
- Get going. I'm busy.
- I thought you ought to know

39
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:11,276
- the governor didn't sign that reprieve.
- What?

40
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:14,195
Tomorrow morning Earl Williams dies
and makes a sucker out of us.

41
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:17,991
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- Get the governor on the phone.

42
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:19,325
- I can't.
- Why not?

43
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:22,495
- Can't locate him. He's out fishing.
- How many places to fish are there?

44
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:24,414
At least two - the Atlantic and Pacific.

45
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:26,416
- All right. That simplifies it, doesn't it?
- Oh, yeah.

46
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:28,501
- Get him on the phone.
- And tell him what?

47
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:30,795
HILDY: Quiet, Duffy, he's thinking.

48
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,756
Tell him if <i>he'll</i> reprieve Earl Williams,
we'll support him for senator.

49
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:36,467
- What? - The Morning Post will be
behind him hook, line and sinker.

50
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:37,844
- You can't do that!
- Why not?

51
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:40,597
Because we've been a Democratic paper
for over 20 years.

52
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,641
All right, after we get the reprieve,
we'll be Democratic again.

53
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:45,435
- Oh, Walter-
- Go on, Duffy! Get going!

54
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:48,605
Remember, the Morning Post
expects every city editor to do his duty.

55
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:51,065
- You too, Louie. Get outta here.
- Okay, boss.

56
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:55,528
- (Hildy chuckles)
- WALTER: Mmm.

57
00:03:55,612 --> 00:03:58,031
Well, Walter, I see you're still at it.

58
00:03:58,114 --> 00:04:01,618
Yeah. First time I ever double-crossed
a governor. What can I do for you?

59
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:03,536
Would you mind if I sat down?

60
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,748
There's been a lamp burning
in the window for you, honey. Here.

61
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:10,001
Oh, I jumped out that window
a long time ago, Walter.

62
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:12,086
(Walter chuckles)

63
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:15,256
Oh, may I have one of those?

64
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:17,884
Thank you.

65
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:21,346
And a match.

66
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:23,890
Thank you.

67
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,105
- Well, well, how long is it?
- How long is what?

68
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:34,901
You know what.
How long is it since we've seen each other?

69
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:37,946
Oh, well, let's see.

70
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:40,239
I spent six weeks in Reno, then Bermuda -

71
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:43,743
Oh, about four months, I guess.
Seems like yesterday to me.

72
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:46,245
Maybe it was yesterday, Hildy.

73
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:48,539
Been seeing me in your dreams?

74
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:50,583
No, no, Mama doesn't dream
about you anymore.

75
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,919
- You wouldn't know the old girl now.
- Ah, yes, I would.

76
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:56,339
- I'd know you anytime, anyplace -
- Anyplace, anywhere.

77
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:59,968
You're repeating yourself, Walter. That's
the speech you made the night you proposed.

78
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:02,261
- I notice you still remember it.
- Of course I remember it.

79
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:04,263
If I didn't, I wouldn't have divorced you.

80
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:06,766
- Sort of wish you hadn't done that, Hildy.
- Done what?

81
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,936
Divorced me.
It makes a fellow lose all faith in himself.

82
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:12,939
Gives him a - almost gives him
a feeling he wasn't wanted.

83
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:15,358
Oh, now look, Junior,
that's what divorces are for.

84
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:17,276
Nonsense.
You've got an old-fashioned idea

85
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,029
divorce is something that lasts forever,
till death do us part.

86
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:22,448
Why, divorce doesn't mean anything
nowadays, Hildy.

87
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:25,201
Just a few words mumbled over you
by a judge.

88
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:27,954
We've got something between us
nothing can change.

89
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:32,083
- Mmm, well, I suppose you're right in a way.
- Sure, I'm right.

90
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,169
- I am fond of you, you know.
- That-a-girl.

91
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:37,714
- I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
- Eh

92
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,968
Latin, I suppose. You must meet my mother.
She'd like that phrase.

93
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:44,178
Then why did you promise
not to fight the divorce

94
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:46,806
and do everything you possibly could
to gum up the whole works?

95
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,142
I meant to let you go,
but you know how it is.

96
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:51,310
You never miss the water
till the well runs dry.

97
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:54,313
Oh, a big, fat lummox like you
hiring an airplane

98
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:58,651
to write, “Hildy, don't be hasty.
Remember my dimple. Walter.”

99
00:05:58,735 --> 00:06:01,362
Delayed our divorce 20 minutes
while the judge went out to watch it.

100
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:05,658
I don't want to brag, but I've still got
the dimple, and in the same place.

101
00:06:05,742 --> 00:06:09,328
Look, Hildy, I only acted like any husband
that didn't want to see his home broken up.

102
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:11,831
- What home?
- Don't you remember the home I promised you?

103
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:15,334
Sure, I do. That was the one we were
to have right after the honeymoon.

104
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:17,336
(laughs) That honeymoon.

105
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,299
Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine
was gonna have another cave-in?

106
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:24,343
I intended to be with you
on our honeymoon, Hildy. Honest, I did.

107
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:27,680
All I know is that instead of two weeks
in Atlantic City with my bridegroom,

108
00:06:27,764 --> 00:06:30,850
I spent two weeks in a coal mine
with John Kruptzky.

109
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,519
- You don't deny that, do you, Walter?
- Deny it? I'm proud of it!

110
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:36,022
- We beat the whole country on that story.
- Suppose we did?

111
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:38,024
That isn't what I got married for!

112
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:40,860
Oh, what is the good of-
Look - Now look, Walter.

113
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:42,862
What I came up here to tell you

114
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:46,407
is that you must stop phoning me a dozen
times a day, sending me 20 telegrams -

115
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:48,743
I write a beautiful telegram, don't I?
Everybody says so.

116
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:52,371
- Are you going to listen to what I have to say?
- Look, what's the use of fighting, Hildy?

117
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:54,749
I tell you what -
come back to work on the paper.

118
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:58,836
If we find we can't get along in
a friendly fashion, <i>we'll</i> get married again.

119
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,714
- What?
- Certainly. I haven't any hard feelings.

120
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:04,884
Oh, Walter, you're wonderful
in a loathsome sort of way.

121
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:07,762
Now please be quiet long enough
for me to tell you what I came to say.

122
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,806
- We'll have some lunch -
- I have a lunch date already.

123
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:11,766
- Well, break it.
- I cannot break it.

124
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:15,311
- Take your hands off me! What are you
playing, osteopath? 
- Temper, temper.

125
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:19,857
Oh, listen, Walter, you are no longer
my husband and no longer my boss.

126
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:22,693
- And you're not going to be my boss.
- What's that supposed to mean?

127
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:25,780
- Just what I say.
- You're not coming back to the paper?

128
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,865
You are right, Mr. Burns,
for the first time today.

129
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:31,160
- Uh-huh. Got a better offer, huh?
- You bet I've got a better offer.

130
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:33,329
All right, go on. Take it.
Work for somebody else.

131
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,331
- That's the gratitude I get!
- Stop hamming.

132
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:39,836
What were you five years ago? A college girl
from a school of journalism. A doll-faced hick!

133
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,796
You wouldn't take me
if I hadn't been doll-faced.

134
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,091
I thought it'd be a novelty - a face around here
a man could look at without shuddering.

135
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,260
- Listen, Walter -
- I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy.

136
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:49,762
But you won't be half as good
on any other paper. We're a team!

137
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:52,265
-(imitating auctioneer) - You need me, I
need you, the paper needs both of us!

138
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:54,767
- Sold, American!
- Oh, all right, go ahead.

139
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:56,853
- Listen, Walter, please.
- Mm-hmm.

140
00:07:56,936 --> 00:08:00,398
The paper's gonna have to get along
without me. So are you.

141
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,024
Just didn't work out, Walter.

142
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:05,903
Well, it would've worked out if you'd been
satisfied with just being editor and reporter.

143
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:08,114
But not you.
You had to marry me, spoil everything.

144
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:09,657
I wasn't satisfy -

145
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,118
- I suppose I proposed to you?
- Well, you practically did.

146
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:16,038
Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years
until I broke down. “Oh, Walter.”

147
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:18,207
I still claim I was tight
the night I proposed.

148
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,501
If you'd have been a gentleman,
you'd have forgotten about it.

149
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:22,295
- Why, you -
- You're losing your eye.

150
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:23,880
You used to pitch better than that.

151
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:25,882
Hello. Yeah. What?

152
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:27,925
Sweeney? What can I do for you?

153
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:30,887
What? Wait a minute.
I'm not Sweeney. I'm Duffy.

154
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,056
Listen, Sweeney, you can't do that to me!
Not today of all days!

155
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,642
What's the matter with you?
Are you loony?

156
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:40,730
Jumping Jehoshaphat!
Now listen, Sweeney, this is no time -

157
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:44,567
Oh, all right, I suppose so.

158
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,069
Yes, if you have to, you have to.

159
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:49,697
- He had to.
- Everything happens to me.

160
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,075
365 days in the year,
and this has to be the day.

161
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,660
- What's the matter, Walter?
- Sweeney.

162
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:56,537
- Dead?
- He might just as well be.

163
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:59,540
The only man on the paper that can write,
and he picks today to have a baby!

164
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:01,250
He didn't do it on purpose, did he?

165
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:04,462
I don't care! He's supposed to be covering
the Earl Williams case. And where is he?

166
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:07,548
Walking up and down in a hospital.
ls there no sense of honor in this country?

167
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:10,134
- Haven't you got anybody else?
- No.

168
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:12,470
No, there's nobody else
on the paper that can write.

169
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:13,971
This will break me.

170
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:16,265
Unless - Hildy.

171
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:19,560
- No. Not a chance. Don't bother me.
- You gotta help me just this once.

172
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:22,063
- Get outta here, Duffy. I'm busy! Now look -
- Save your breath.

173
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:24,357
This will bring us back together,
the way we used to be.

174
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,400
That's what I'm afraid of-
“Anytime, anyplace, anywhere!”

175
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:30,071
This is bigger than anything that ever happened
to us! Don't do it for me. Do it for the paper.

176
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:33,491
- Scram, Svengali.
- If you won't do it for love, how about money?

177
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,576
Forget the other offer.
I'll raise you <i>25</i> bucks a week.

178
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,663
- Listen to me, you bumble-headed baboon.
- Thirty-five bucks and not a cent more.

179
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:40,539
- Walter, are you gonna listen?
- Good grief!

180
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:43,125
- How much is that other paper gonna pay you?
- There isn't any other paper.

181
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:46,254
Oh. Well, in that case, the raise is off.
You go back to your old salary.

182
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:48,464
- Trying to blackjack me -
- I want to show you something.

183
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,466
- I'm busy.
- It's a ring. Take a good look.

184
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,843
You know what it is?
It's an engagement ring.

185
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:57,515
Engagement ring?

186
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,225
Uh-huh.

187
00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:04,313
I tried to tell you right away,
but you would start reminiscing.

188
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:06,565
I'm getting married, Walter,

189
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:10,778
and I'm also getting as far away
from the newspaper business as I can get.

190
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,489
- What?
- (chuckles) I am through.

191
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,950
Get married all you want,
but you can't quit the newspaper business.

192
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:19,078
- Oh, why not?
- I know what quitting would mean to you.

193
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:21,247
- What would it mean?
- It would kill you!

194
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,582
- You can't sell me that, Walter Burns.
- Who says I can't?

195
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,668
- You're a newspaperman.
- That's why I'm quitting.

196
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:28,838
- I want to go where I can be a woman.
- You mean be a traitor.

197
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,923
- A traitor to what?
- A traitor to journalism.

198
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:34,468
- You're a journalist, Hildy!
- A journalist? Now, what does that mean?

199
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:37,513
Peeking through keyholes?
Chasing after fire engines?

200
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:40,266
Waking people up to ask them
if Hitler's gonna start another war?

201
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,268
Stealing pictures off old ladies?

202
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:44,061
I know all about reporters, Walter.

203
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:46,605
A lot of daffy buttinskies running around
without a nickel in their pockets

204
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:49,608
so a million hired girls and motormen's wives
will know what's going on.

205
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:51,444
Why, I -

206
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:53,821
Oh, what's the use?

207
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:57,283
Walter, you wouldn't know what it means
to... well, to want to be respectable

208
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,827
and live a halfway normal life.

209
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:03,622
The point is, I - I'm through.

210
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,752
Where'd you meet this man?

211
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:09,920
- Bermuda.
- Rich, huh?

212
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:13,799
He's not what you call rich.
Makes about 5,000 a year.

213
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:16,802
- What's his line?
- He's in the insurance business.

214
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:18,637
- Insurance business?
- Uh-huh.

215
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:21,640
- That's a good, honest business, isn't it?
- Oh, certainly, it's honest.

216
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:23,642
It's also adventurous. It's romantic.

217
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:27,021
Listen, Hildy, I can't picture you
being surrounded by policies.

218
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,982
Well, I can, and I like it, what's more.

219
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:32,651
Besides, he forgets the office
when he's with me.

220
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,988
He doesn't treat me like an errand boy either.
He treats me like a woman.

221
00:11:36,072 --> 00:11:39,408
He does, does he? Mm-hmm.
How did I treat you? Like a water buffalo?

222
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:42,328
I don't know from water buffaloes,
but I do know about him.

223
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,789
- He's kind and sweet and considerate.
- (mocking, high-pitched) Mm-hmm.

224
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,999
- He wants a home and children.
- (chuckles)

225
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,752
Sounds more like a guy I ought to marry.
What's his name?

226
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:52,171
Uh, Baldwin. Bruce Baldwin.

227
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:54,173
Baldwin, Baldwin.
Oh, I knew a Baldwin once.

228
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:56,592
A horse thief in Mississippi.
Couldn't be the same fellow, could it?

229
00:11:56,675 --> 00:12:00,054
You're now talking about the man
I'm marrying tomorrow.

230
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,724
Tomorrow? As soon as that?

231
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:05,434
Mm-hmm.

232
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:11,690
Well, at last I got out
what I came up here to tell you.

233
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:16,654
Guess there isn't any more to the story.

234
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:19,573
- So long, Walter.
- So long, Hildy.

235
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:22,410
- And better luck to you next time.
- Thanks.

236
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:25,496
- Oh, Hildy.
- Huh?

237
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:30,584
Uh... well, you kind of took
the wind out of my sails.

238
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:35,047
Look, honey, I just want to wish you
everything I couldn't give you.

239
00:12:35,131 --> 00:12:36,424
Thank you, Walter.

240
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:41,846
This other fellow - Well, I'm sorry
I didn't get a chance to see him.

241
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:45,099
I'm more or less particular
about whom my wife marries.

242
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:49,395
- Where is he?
- He's right on the job, waiting for me out there.

243
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,730
Oh. Do you mind if I meet him?

244
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:53,899
Oh, no, Walter.
It wouldn't do any good, really.

245
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:56,652
- You're not afraid, are you?
- Afraid? Of course not.

246
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,321
Well, then, come on.
Let's see this paragon.

247
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:01,574
- Is he as good as you say?
- Why, he's better.

248
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:03,868
- Then what does he want with you?
- Oh, now you got me.

249
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,995
Back in an hour, Mildred.

250
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:08,372
Oh! Oh, I am sorry, Hildy.

251
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:10,040
- I suppose Bruce - What's his name?
- Baldwin.

252
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:11,876
- I suppose he opens doors for you.
- He does.

253
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:15,212
- When he's with a lady, he takes his hat off.
- Oh, I am sorry.

254
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:17,756
And when he walks with a lady,
he waits for her.

255
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,758
Oh, well, in that case -

256
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:23,179
Allow me.

257
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:29,894
Well, I can see right away my wife
picked out the right husband for herself.

258
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:33,147
- How do you do, sir?
- Must be some mistake. I'm already married.

259
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,524
Already married? (clicks tongue)

260
00:13:36,484 --> 00:13:39,820
Oh, Hildy, you should've told me.
Congratulations again, Mr. Baldwin.

261
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:41,280
- No, my name is -
- Mr. Burns.

262
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:44,450
Excuse me. I'm terribly busy.
Just leave your card. What did you say?

263
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,160
- Mr. Burns. Mr. Burns.
- My name is -

264
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:48,746
Some other time.
I'm busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin here.

265
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,415
- I didn't hear what you said.
- I was going to say that my name -

266
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:54,668
- Look, what is it with you?
- I'm Bruce Baldwin.

267
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:56,337
- Oh, you're Bruce Baldwin.
- Yes.

268
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,757
- Well, who is he? Who are you?
- My name's Pete Davis.

269
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,426
- Mr. Davis, is this any concern of yours?
- No.

270
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,095
From now on <i>I'll</i> thank you
to keep your nose out of my affairs.

271
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,056
And don't let it happen again.

272
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:11,310
Mr. Baldwin, I'm sorry about this mistake.
This is indeed a pleasure.

273
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,145
Oh, that's wrong, isn't it?

274
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:15,523
Well, Bruce -
You don't mind if I call you Bruce?

275
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:18,442
- After all, we're practically related.
- No, not at all.

276
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:21,278
You see, my wife -
That is, your wife - I mean, Hildy -

277
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:24,657
Hildy, you led me to expect
you were marrying a much older man.

278
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,992
Oh, really? What did I say
that led you to expect such -

279
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:29,745
Don't worry about it.
I realize you didn't mean old in years.

280
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,872
(chuckles)

281
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:35,459
- You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
- Well, it looked a little cloudy this morning.

282
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:37,294
That's right. Rubbers too, I hope.

283
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:40,923
Attaboy. A man ought to be prepared
for any emergency.

284
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,717
- I think we'd better be running along.
- Yes, we'd better be going.

285
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:46,845
- Where are we going?
- I'm taking you two to lunch. Didn't you tell him?

286
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:50,140
- No, she didn't.
- I guess she wanted to surprise you.

287
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:52,601
After you. After you, Hildy.

288
00:14:52,685 --> 00:14:55,396
You're wasting your time.
It won't do a bit of good.

289
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,815
No, I'm glad to do it. Glad to do it.

290
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:03,070
Well, hello, Gus.

291
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:06,365
- Don't tell me it's you, Hildy.
- It's none other. How have things been?

292
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,200
- I can't complain.
- I can. I'm hungry.

293
00:15:08,284 --> 00:15:10,286
Get me a roast beef sandwich.
Rare on white - Oh.

294
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:12,830
- Sorry.
- On white bread. Over there, Bruce.

295
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,541
- You, Hildy?
- I'll have the same, I guess.

296
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:18,127
- You, sir?
- Yes, that's all right for me.

297
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,046
- Bring some mustard too, Gus.
- Yes, sir.

298
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,424
Ah, Well, Well, Well.

299
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:26,093
- So, you two are gonna get married, huh?
- (Bruce chuckles)

300
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:29,054
- Well, how's it feel, Bruce?
- Feels awful good. Yes, sir.

301
00:15:29,138 --> 00:15:32,308
- You're getting a great little girl.
- I realize that.

302
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:36,979
Things have been different for me ever since
I met Hildy. I've never met anyone like her.

303
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:39,064
Everybody else I've ever known,

304
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:43,235
well, you could always tell ahead of time
what they were gonna say or do.

305
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:47,156
But Hildy's not like that.
You can't tell that about her.

306
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:49,908
- That's nice.
- Yes. You're getting something else too.

307
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:52,995
- You're getting a great newspaperman.
- No orchids, Walter.

308
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:56,874
One of the best I ever knew.
Sorry to see her go. Darn sorry, Hildy.

309
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,251
- I'd like to believe you meant that.
- I do mean it.

310
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:01,420
If you ever want to come back
to the newspaper business -

311
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,088
Which I won't.

312
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:07,176
Ah, well, in spite of everything, if I ever do,
there's only one man I'd work for.

313
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:10,846
- I'd kill you if you ever worked for anybody else.
- Hear that, Bruce? That's my diploma.

314
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,641
It must be quite a business if it's -

315
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:17,311
- Hildy, are you sure you want to quit?
- What do you mean?

316
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:20,731
I mean, if there's any doubt about it,
or if there's anything that -

317
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:25,611
No. This is your chance to have a home
and to be, like you said, a human being.

318
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:30,199
- And I'm going to make you take that chance.
- Certainly. Why, I wouldn't let her stay.

319
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:34,787
No, she deserves all this happiness, Bruce,
all the things I couldn't give her.

320
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,624
- Yeah, all she ever wanted was a home.
<i>- I'll</i> certainly try to give her one.

321
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:41,460
- I know you will. Where you gonna live?
- Albany.

322
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:44,588
- Albany, huh? Got a family up there?
- Just my mother.

323
00:16:44,672 --> 00:16:47,132
Just your mother, huh? Mmm.
You're gonna live with your mother?

324
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:49,426
Well, just for the first year.

325
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,096
Oh, well, that will be nice. Yes, yes.

326
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,848
A home with Mother. In Albany too.

327
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:58,936
Mighty nice town, Albany.
They've got the state capitol there.

328
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,563
Yeah, I know.
We were there once.

329
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:09,113
Listen, will you ever forget the night
you brought the governor back to the hotel?

330
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:12,908
You see, I was in taking a bath.
I came walking out without -

331
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,410
(clears throat)

332
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:17,871
She didn't know I was in town.

333
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:21,041
Well, uh, Bruce, how is business up there?
Any better?

334
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,544
Well, Albany's
a mighty good insurance town.

335
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:27,965
- Most people there take it out early in life.
- Yeah, well, I can see why they would.

336
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,675
Statistics show that most of our policies-

337
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:33,679
You know, I've got a feeling I ought to
have taken out a little insurance.

338
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:36,557
Course, that really doesn't matter
now that Hildy and I have, uh -

339
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,978
Well, you know, we've, uh - pfft. Does it?
Or does it? What do you think?

340
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:44,189
Still, it might've been
a good idea if we - if I had.

341
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:49,153
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure
I'm in one business that really helps people.

342
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:52,489
Course, we don't help you much
while you're alive, but afterward.

343
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:53,991
- That's what counts.
- Sure.

344
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,701
(Hildy's foot bangs against table)

345
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:57,369
- I don't get it.
- Ouch!

346
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,331
- Nice going.
- I'm so sorry, Gus. My foot must've slipped.

347
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:04,668
Oh. That's all right.
What would you like to drink?

348
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:07,296
- Coffee, Gus.
- Shall I put rum in? It's a nasty day.

349
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:08,839
- Sure.
- Me too, Gus, please.

350
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,507
- And you, sir?
- Not for me, thanks.

351
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:13,260
- Go on, Bruce.
- No, I have a lot to do this afternoon.

352
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:16,638
- I have to buy the tickets, check the baggage.
- Do it tomorrow. There's plenty of time.

353
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:20,934
But we're leaving today at 4:00.
Taking the sleeper for Albany.

354
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:23,020
Oh. You, uh -

355
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,022
You're leaving today at 4:00, huh?

356
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,940
- Mm-hmm.
- Say, that's only two hours.

357
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:30,110
- Doesn't give us much time.
- No, and I've got a lot to do -

358
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:33,113
Look at that! isn't that silly?
All down over my front.

359
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:36,408
- That's nothing new. Here.
- Never mind. Hey, Gus.

360
00:18:36,492 --> 00:18:38,577
Gus, do something about this, will you?

361
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,246
(whispering) Call me to the telephone
as soon as I get back to the table.

362
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,623
- Sure.
- (normal voice) Thanks, Gus.

363
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,666
That's fine. Thanks, it's fine.

364
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,836
(clears throat) I'm terribly sorry
about that. Silly, wasn't it?

365
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,924
Listen, Bruce, let me get that straight.
I must've misunderstood you.

366
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:54,927
You're taking the sleeper today
and then getting married tomorrow?

367
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:58,138
- Oh, well, it's not like that.
- Well, what is it like?

368
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:00,724
Oh, poor Walter.
<i>He'll</i> toss and turn all night.

369
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:03,227
Perhaps we'd better tell him
Mother's coming along too.

370
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,563
- Mother? Your mother kicked the bucket -
- No, my mother. My mother.

371
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:09,107
Oh, your m -
Well, that relieves my mind.

372
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:11,443
It was cruel of us
to let you suffer that way.

373
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:14,071
Isn't Walter sweet?
Always wanting to protect me.

374
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:17,866
Well, I admit I wasn't much of a husband.
But you can always count on me, Hildy.

375
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,912
I don't think she'll need you, Mr. Burns.
I aim to do most of the protecting myself.

376
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,747
Mr. Burns, telephone.

377
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:25,207
- For me?
- Yes, sir.

378
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,293
That's strange. Uh, pardon me.

379
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:32,714
Hildy, he's not such a bad fellow.

380
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:35,092
No. He should make some girl real happy.

381
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,177
- Mm-hmm.
- (whispering) Slaphappy.

382
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:40,848
He's not the man for you. I can see that.
But I sort of like him.

383
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:42,683
He's got a lot of charm.

384
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:46,228
Well, he comes by it naturally.
His grandfather was a snake.

385
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:50,274
Hello? Hello? Hey, Duffy, listen.

386
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:53,569
Is there any way we can stop the 4:00 train
to Albany from leaving town?

387
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:56,196
<i>- We might dynamite it.
- Could we?</i>

388
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,491
Oh, well, maybe we couldn't.
All right, now get this.

389
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:03,537
Get ahold of Sweeney and send him
out of town on a two-weeks vacation.

390
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,582
All right, keep your shirt on.
Hildy's coming back.

391
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:09,334
She doesn't know it yet,
but I promise you she's staying here.

392
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:12,546
Tell Louie to stick around the office.
I may need him. Good-bye.

393
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,174
Thanks, Gus.

394
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:18,510
- This is bad business.
- What's the matter, Walter?

395
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:21,680
- Oh, the Earl Williams case.
- I've been reading about that.

396
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,807
- It's pretty bad.
- What is the lowdown on it?

397
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:27,269
Simple, honey. Poor little dope
who lost his job and went berserk.

398
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:30,606
Shot a cop who was coming to quiet him down.
They're gonna hang him tomorrow.

399
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,024
- What a shame.
- Your paper -

400
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:34,276
- You've been taking his side, haven't you?
- Mm-hmm.

401
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:37,738
If he was out of his mind,
why doesn't the state just put him away?

402
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:40,449
It happened to be a colored policeman.
You know what that means, Hildy.

403
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:43,243
Mm-hmm. The colored vote's
very important in this town.

404
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:45,245
Especially with an election
coming up three or four days.

405
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:48,165
That mayor, he'd hang
his own grandmother to be reelected.

406
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,667
I should think you could just show
that the man wasn't responsible.

407
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:54,713
- That's not so easy.
- Mmm, maybe it isn't so hard either.

408
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,548
What do you mean, Hildy?

409
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:59,134
Don't they have to have another expert
examine him before they hang him?

410
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:02,804
Sure. A bird named Egelhoffer is gonna do it.
He'll say the same as the rest.

411
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:05,265
- Suppose he does?
- What's your scheme, Hildy?

412
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:09,937
Look, you get the interview with Earl Williams,
print Egelhoffer's statement.

413
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,440
And right alongside of it, you know,
double column, run your interview.

414
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:15,984
Alienist says he's sane.
Interview shows he's goofy.

415
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:18,737
Hildy, you could do it!
You could save that poor devil's life.

416
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,073
- Uh-uh-uh. No.
- You could - Oh, yeah.

417
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:22,866
- You're going away. I forgot.
- That's right.

418
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:27,496
- How long would the interview take?
- An hour. Another to write it. That's all.

419
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:30,374
We could take the 6:00 train
if it'd save a man's life.

420
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,959
No, Bruce.

421
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:35,128
If you want to save Earl Williams' life,
you write the interview yourself.

422
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:38,006
- You're still a good reporter.
- You know I can't write that kind of thing.

423
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:41,134
- It takes a woman's touch, that heart -
- Don't get poetic.

424
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:44,304
Get Sweeney. He's the best man
on the paper for that sob-sister stuff.

425
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:49,309
Poor Sweeney. Duffy just told me
his wife finally had twins. isn't that terrible?

426
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:52,145
Sweeney went out to celebrate,
and now we can't find him anymore.

427
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:54,648
So, Sweeney has twins,
Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.

428
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:57,818
- Now, Walter, look -
- You argue with her.

429
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:00,195
Otherwise you're going on a honeymoon
with blood on your hands.

430
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:02,030
How can you have happiness after that?

431
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:04,866
All through the years you'll remember
that a man went to the gallows

432
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,536
because she was too selfish
to wait two hours.

433
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,955
Earl Williams' face will come
between you on the train tonight

434
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:12,416
and at the preacher's tomorrow
and all the rest of your lives.

435
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,710
- Stop, Walter! The whole place'll hear you.
- Stop what?

436
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:16,586
- What an act.
- Huh? Huh?

437
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:20,424
I just remembered Sweeney
was only married four months ago.

438
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:23,510
(Walter snickers, laughs)

439
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:26,596
All right, Hildy, you win. I'm licked.

440
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,808
- Then Mrs. Sweeney didn't have twins.
- (Hildy chuckles)

441
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:34,688
- No, indeed. The twins were Walter's. All his.
- Oh, it was nothing.

442
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:37,691
Well, let's forget it.
We'll start all over again.

443
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,402
- I'll offer you two a business proposition.
- We're not interested.

444
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:44,156
- You'll be interested. You're a smart young man.
- Don't listen. I know him from way back.

445
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:47,701
Excuse me, will you? I'm talking to him.
Now look, Bruce.

446
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:51,621
Persuade Hildy to do the story and you
can write out a fat insurance policy for me.

447
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:54,833
Oh, no. I wouldn't use my wife
for business purposes.

448
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,043
Wait a minute, Bruce.

449
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:58,587
- Walter, how big a policy?
- Oh, $25,000.

450
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,921
- What?
-$50,000.

451
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:03,216
- What's the commission on a $100,000 policy?
- Around $1,000. But, Hildy -

452
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,219
What's wrong with $1,000?
We could use that money.

453
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:10,223
- How long would it take to get him examined?
- I could get a doctor here in 20 minutes.

454
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:12,642
- Well, get him.
- You keep out of this.

455
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:15,979
All right, Bruce, suppose you have
Mr. Burns examined over in his office

456
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:18,982
and see what they'll allow
on that old carcass of his.

457
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:22,611
- Say, I'm better than I ever was.
- It was never anything to brag about.

458
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:26,573
Now look, Bruce, <i>I'll</i> go back and change.
After you get the check, you phone me.

459
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:29,451
I'll be in the press room
at the criminal courts building.

460
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:33,121
Walter, by the way, I think you'd better
make that a certified check.

461
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:36,666
- What do you think I am, a crook?
- Yes. No certified check, no story. Get me?

462
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,170
<i>- It'll</i> be certified. Want my fingerprints?
- No. I've still got those.

463
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:42,255
Gus, how much do I owe you?

464
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:47,094
- Thank you, dear. Oh, Bruce -
- Oh, I'm sorry.

465
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:50,347
- How much money have you got with you?
- Everything we have - $500.

466
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,349
- Give me the $500.
- I have to buy the tickets.

467
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:54,976
I'll buy the tickets.
I know what I'm doing.

468
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,437
- He'll get you in a crap game or -
- I don't gamble.

469
00:23:57,521 --> 00:24:01,358
I know a lot of people that never did
anything till they met Walter Burns.

470
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:03,693
All right, but remember,
it's everything we have.

471
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,403
- I know.
- WALTER: Oh, Bruce.

472
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:06,947
- You got change of ten?
- I just -

473
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:10,242
- See what I mean, don't you, Bruce?
- I just gave everything I had to Hildy.

474
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:12,035
- All I've got left is -
- Come on, Hildy.

475
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,746
- Not me. Sign it.
- Oh, all right.

476
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:18,375
For the waiter.

477
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,002
-(Bruce laughs)
- Come on, Bruce. Really.

478
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:26,842
- I'll open for a dime.
- I'm in.

479
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:29,469
- I'll stay.
- Wilcox 3-400.

480
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:31,513
-(phone ringing)
- I'm in. Two.

481
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:34,474
Take that, one of you birds.
You ain't doing anything, Ernie.

482
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:36,476
<i>- I'll</i> take two.
- And one for the dealer.

483
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,897
What's the matter with you guys?
Crippled or something?

484
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:43,150
Press room. Huh? Wait a minute.

485
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:45,527
Hello, Sarge. McCue talking.
Hold the line, will ya.

486
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:49,656
What? No, I told you this is the press room
in the criminal courts building.

487
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:51,658
Jake, new lead on the hanging.

488
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:54,870
This alienist from New York,
Dr. Max J. Egelhoffer-

489
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:56,454
Egelhoffer. Yeah.

490
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:59,249
He's going to interview Williams
in about half an hour in the sheriffs office.

491
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:01,751
Must be about the tenth alienist
they've put on Williams.

492
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:05,213
If he wasn't crazy before, he would be
by the time ten of those babies got through.

493
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:06,590
Give me the desk.

494
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:09,509
- Is this guy Egelhoffer any good?
- Figure it out for yourself.

495
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:12,846
He's the guy they sent to Washington
to interview the brain trust.

496
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:14,556
He said <i>they</i> were sane.

497
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:18,143
- Here's the situation on the eve of the hanging.
- I'll pick up a little fudge.

498
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:20,937
This is Murphy.
More slop on the hanging.

499
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:23,565
A double guard has been thrown
around the jail, municipal buildings,

500
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:25,525
railroad terminals and elevated stations

501
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:28,069
to prepare for the expected
general uprising of radicals -

502
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:29,779
- Ready?
-at the hour of execution.

503
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:32,741
The sheriff has just put
200 more relatives on the payroll

504
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:37,037
to protect the city from the red army,
which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.

505
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,166
Trouble is, when the real red menace shows,
the sheriff will still be cryin' wolf.

506
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:43,168
- What do ya got?
- Is that good?

507
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:46,796
- HILDY: Sure looks good from here.
- Hildy, when did you get back?

508
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,132
- Hi, Ernie.
- Hiya, Hildy. Glad to see ya.

509
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:52,010
- Where'd you get the hat?
- I paid 12 bucks for that hat.

510
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:54,554
- Going back to work?
- It's just a farewell appearance.

511
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:56,848
- I'm going into business for myself.
- What doin'?

512
00:25:56,932 --> 00:25:59,309
- I'm getting married tomorrow.
- What? Again?

513
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,937
- She'll never learn.
- Are we invited to the wedding?

514
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,856
- I might use you for a bridesmaid, Roy.
- Uh-oh.

515
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,026
- How are you, Murphy?
- What are you gettin' married for, Hildy?

516
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:11,446
- None of your business.
- You ain't foolin' us, are you, Hildy?

517
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:15,700
Look what I've got in here. Three tickets
to Albany on the 6:00 train tonight.

518
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:17,994
- What do you mean, three?
- For me and my beau.

519
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:21,831
- And hats off, boys, his sweet darling mom.
- Oh, that's nice.

520
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:25,085
- What kind of marriage is that?
- It's gonna be all right. I'm gonna settle down.

521
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:27,087
I'm through with the newspaper business.

522
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:30,257
Can you picture Hildy singing lullabies
and hanging out didies?

523
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,592
- Swapping lies over the back fence.
- Sour grapes.

524
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:34,594
She'll be back soon
as she gets tired of beating rugs.

525
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:36,596
- I'm not gonna beat any rugs.
-(bell ringing)

526
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,724
Hey, that's Third and Jefferson.
Isn't that where Central School is?

527
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:43,561
- No school this time of day.
- What do you care? You quit.

528
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:45,772
Just thought it might be
a good fire, that's all.

529
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,691
-(thuds)
- What's that?

530
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:50,443
Just practicing for
the Williams party in the morning.

531
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:53,154
- Gonna miss a nice hanging, Hildy.
- Not interested.

532
00:26:53,238 --> 00:26:55,240
Tell 'em to pipe down.

533
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:03,999
Hey, keep quiet down there!
How do you expect us to get any work done?

534
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:06,668
Aw, shut up!

535
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:08,920
Very little respect
for the press around here.

536
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:12,465
- Did anybody phone me?
- Not that I know of.

537
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:16,177
- Say, does Walter know you're gettin' married?
- Just had lunch with him.

538
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:19,347
- Does he know you're quittin'?
- Yes, I told him. Any more questions?

539
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:21,516
- Shall I deal you in?
- I haven't got time.

540
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,560
I have to do a yarn on Williams.

541
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:25,937
Did he know what he was doing
when he fired that gun?

542
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:29,149
If you ask us, no.
If you ask the state alienist, yes.

543
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:31,443
- Who is he? What's he do?
- He was a bookkeeper.

544
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:35,363
He starts at $20 a week and after 14 years
he gradually works himself up to 17.50.

545
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:36,573
- Got more gum?
- No.

546
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:39,617
McClosky company goes out of business,
and Williams loses his job.

547
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:41,536
- Can't get another?
- No.

548
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:42,954
I'm in.

549
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:44,706
So he starts hanging around the park,

550
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:48,626
listening to soapbox spellbinders making
phony speeches and begins to believe 'em.

551
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,253
And makes some of his own.

552
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,172
- Up a dime.
- I'm in.

553
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:57,093
-(exhales sharply) Anything else, Doc?
- No, that'll be about all, Mr. Burns.

554
00:27:57,177 --> 00:28:00,138
- Everything okay?
- You have nothing to worry about.

555
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:02,349
Good, good. How you doing, Bruce?

556
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,769
- Uh, there's just one more thing.
- Good day, Mr. Burns, Mr. Baldwin.

557
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:08,229
- Good-bye, Doc. Thanks very much.
- Good day, Doc.

558
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:11,191
- Who's the beneficiary?
- Uh, excuse me? Excuse me?

559
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:14,611
That is, in case of your death,
who do we pay the money to?

560
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:16,696
Why, Hildy, of course!

561
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,033
Aw, I don't know.
That'd make me feel pretty funny.

562
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:23,620
Oh, now, why shouldn't I make Hildy
my, uh, whatever it was?

563
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:28,041
- I feel I should take care of her.
- But you will take care of her, Bruce.

564
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:31,169
Say, if that doctor's right,
I'm good for a long time, yes?

565
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:34,547
Look, Bruce,
this is a debt of honor with me.

566
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:37,342
I was a bad husband to Hildy.

567
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:41,012
She could've claimed a lot of alimony
if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any.

568
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:43,264
She had it coming to her,
but she was too independent.

569
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:46,267
- Well, I'm independent too.
- I know you are, Bruce. I know you are.

570
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:48,812
But look, you just figure it this way.

571
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:52,690
I'm good for, well,
we'll say at least <i>25</i> years yet.

572
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:57,028
By that time, you'll probably have made enough
so that the money won't mean anything to you.

573
00:28:57,112 --> 00:28:59,030
But suppose you haven't
made good, Bruce.

574
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:01,783
What about Hildy's old age? Think of Hildy.

575
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:04,285
Ah, I can see her now.

576
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:07,747
White haired. Lavender and old lace.

577
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:10,625
- Can't you see her, Bruce?
- Yes. Yes, I can.

578
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,544
She's old, isn't she?

579
00:29:12,627 --> 00:29:15,547
Now, Bruce, don't you think
that Hildy's entitled

580
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,134
to spend her last remaining years
without worries of money?

581
00:29:19,217 --> 00:29:22,929
- Of course you do, Bruce.
- Of course, if you put it that way.

582
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:26,224
WALTER: And remember, I love her too.

583
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:30,228
Yes, I'm beginning to realize that.

584
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:34,107
And the beauty of it is, she'll never
have to know until I've passed on.

585
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:38,653
WALTER:
Oh, well, maybe she'll think kindly of me

586
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:41,072
after I'm gone.

587
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:46,953
Gee.

588
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:49,831
(blowing nose)

589
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:54,627
You make me feel like a heel
comin' between ya.

590
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:57,422
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us.

591
00:29:57,505 --> 00:30:00,091
It was all over for her before you
came on the scene. For me -

592
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:03,261
- Hey, Walter.
- It'll never be. What do you want?

593
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:05,889
Can I see you a minute, please?

594
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,433
Excuse me, Bruce.

595
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,227
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

596
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:13,146
- Where is it? Come on.
- There.

597
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:16,816
- Certified?
- Sure. But, Walter, that's for $2,500.

598
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,280
- Bruce, here we are, certified and everything.
- Certified.

599
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:28,536
Gosh, I'm afraid Hildy will feel ashamed
to think she hasn't trusted you.

600
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,747
- But she'll know someday.
- Ah, yes.

601
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,208
Bruce, you promised to phone her
as soon as you got the check.

602
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:35,293
Oh, yes, yes. Of course.

603
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:38,505
Get me Hildy Johnson, press room,
criminal courts building.

604
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:41,925
- Sit down. The operator will get her for you.
- Thank you.

605
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:45,053
- Excuse me, will you?
- Yes.

606
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:48,515
Hello? Yes, <i>I'll</i> wait. Thank you.

607
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:50,350
(ringing)

608
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:51,935
Start hollerin'.

609
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:54,145
- Hildegarde.
- Thank you.

610
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:57,607
Hildy Johnson speaking. Oh, hello, Bruce.

611
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,193
- I've got a dime left.
- We've been playing for an hour!

612
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:02,529
Take it easy, will you?

613
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:06,074
Hello, Bruce.
Did you get the check? Is it certified?

614
00:31:06,157 --> 00:31:09,244
Certified and everything.
I have it right in my pocket.

615
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:11,496
Oh, in your pocket. That's fine.

616
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:13,998
Wait. Maybe it isn't so fine.
Bruce, where are you?

617
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:16,376
- I'm in Mr. Burns' office.
- Is he there?

618
00:31:17,252 --> 00:31:21,714
Look, Bruce, I don't want you
to carry that check in your pocket.

619
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:25,593
Well, because -
Yes, yes, I know all that, but, uh -

620
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:29,013
Bruce, there's
an old newspaper superstition

621
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:32,183
that the first big check you get,
you put in the lining of your hat.

622
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:36,062
In your hat! It brings good luck.

623
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:38,398
- I've never heard that before.
- Neither did I.

624
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:43,027
It sounds silly, but do it for me, please.
Yes, yes, right now.

625
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:45,196
(chuckling)
All right. Just a minute.

626
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:57,125
There you are. I've done it.
Anything else?

627
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:03,214
Oh, yes. All right. Uh-huh.

628
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:07,385
- Yes, yes, I'll tell him. Good-bye.
- Everything all right?

629
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:09,929
- Hildy said to tell you she'll get right to work.
- Fine.

630
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:12,098
- Well, I must be going now.
- All right.

631
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:15,310
- Oh, Bruce, don't forget this. It might rain.
- Oh, thanks.

632
00:32:15,393 --> 00:32:19,939
- You don't mind if I don't show you out?
- No. Thanks for everything.

633
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:22,150
- Excuse me, what'd you say?
- I said, thanks for everything.

634
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:25,278
Nonsense. Don't thank me.
I should thank you.

635
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:27,822
- So long.
- So long.

636
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:43,630
- Hello, Cooley.
- Hello, Hildy. What are you doing here?

637
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:46,841
- I want an interview with Earl Williams.
- Mm-mmm. No more interviews.

638
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:48,092
- Why not?
- Sheriff's orders.

639
00:32:48,176 --> 00:32:50,803
Besides, the doctor's coming over.
Can't do it.

640
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:52,388
Say, is this your money?

641
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:53,931
- I don't think it is -
- Twenty bucks.

642
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:56,267
- Yeah, I guess maybe it is.
- That's what I thought. Come on.

643
00:32:56,351 --> 00:32:58,978
Hey, Joe, open up here.

644
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:01,105
- Now, Hildy, don't be -
- I won't be long.

645
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:08,196
- Hello, Earl.
- Hello.

646
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:11,157
My name's Johnson.
Mind if I talk to you for a few minutes?

647
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,911
- No. I haven't anything else to do.
- I guess that's right.

648
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:22,835
So, you see, I couldn't plead insanity
because I'm just as sane as anybody else.

649
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:25,380
- You didn't mean to kill that policeman, huh?
- Why, of course not.

650
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:27,465
It's against everything
I've ever stood for.

651
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:30,468
They know it was an accident.
I'm not guilty.

652
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:32,845
It's... It's just the world.

653
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:37,141
I see what you mean.
Sorry about the lipstick, Earl.

654
00:33:37,225 --> 00:33:40,645
Look, after you lost your job,
what did you do?

655
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:44,482
- I tried to find another job.
- I mean, how did you spend your time?

656
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:48,528
I used to sit around the park, anyplace.
Oh, I don't smoke.

657
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:51,614
When you were in the park,
did you hear any of those speeches?

658
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:55,034
- You mean those fellas that talk too much?
- Yeah.

659
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:57,036
Well, I didn't pay any attention.

660
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,372
- Did you hear anything they said?
- Yes.

661
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:02,834
Well, is there anything you remember?
Anything in particular?

662
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:05,044
- There was one fella -
- What did he talk about?

663
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:08,715
- He talked about production for use.
- Production for use.

664
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:12,176
Yes, he said everything
should be made use of.

665
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:16,514
- Makes quite a bit of sense.
- Yes. He was a good speaker.

666
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:21,269
When you found yourself with that gun
and that policeman coming at you,

667
00:34:21,352 --> 00:34:23,521
-what did you think about?
- I don't know exactly.

668
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:26,816
You must've thought of something.
Could it have been “production for use”?

669
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:30,528
- I don't know. I...
- What's a gun for, Earl?

670
00:34:30,611 --> 00:34:31,904
- A gun?
- Mmm.

671
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:34,699
- Why, to shoot, of course.
- Oh.

672
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:37,243
- And maybe that's why you used it.
- Maybe.

673
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:40,788
- Seems reasonable.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

674
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:43,332
I've never had a gun in my hand before.

675
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:46,753
That's what a gun's for, isn't it?
M-Maybe that's why.

676
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:49,046
- Sure, it is.
- Yes, that's what I thought of.

677
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,590
Production for use.

678
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:53,050
- It's simple, isn't it?
- Very simple.

679
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:55,928
- There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
- No, nothing at all.

680
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:58,681
- You'll write about that in your paper, won't you?
- You bet I will.

681
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:02,310
- Who sent you the roses?
- Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.

682
00:35:02,393 --> 00:35:05,688
- That her picture?
- Yes. She's beautiful, isn't she?

683
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:07,774
- COOLEY: Time's up, Hildy.
- Oh, all right.

684
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:12,278
- I guess that's all.
- I like talking to you.

685
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:14,071
Good-bye, Miss Johnson.

686
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,033
Good-bye, Earl.

687
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:18,618
Good luck.

688
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:23,956
- Three landladies, boys.
- You did well, didn't ya?

689
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,125
I wonder what the Postie
gonna do without Hildy.

690
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:28,544
Do you suppose Walter Burns
will ever let her go?

691
00:35:28,628 --> 00:35:31,255
Remember what he did to Bill Fenton
when he wanted to go to Hollywood.

692
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:33,382
- Had him thrown in jail for arson.
- Forgery.

693
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:34,717
- Was that it?
- Yeah.

694
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:37,136
- Gimme some change.
- Hey, Mac.

695
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,472
- Hey, Stairway Sam.
- Huh?

696
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:41,599
- Would you mind turning on some lights?
- Sure.

697
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:43,601
So dark you can't see anything
in this place.

698
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:47,063
- Who's this guy Hildy's gonna marry?
- I don't know. Bruce something.

699
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:49,398
- I give the marriage six months.
- Why?

700
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:51,984
Because she won't be able
to stay away from the paper.

701
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:53,986
Did you see her when that bell went off?

702
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:58,074
At that, it must be pretty nice
to be able to walk out and quit.

703
00:35:58,157 --> 00:36:01,619
I had a publicity job offered to me last year.
Should've taken it.

704
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:03,913
That's what I'd like - a job on the side.

705
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:07,750
With a desk and a stenographer.
I wouldn't mind a nice, big blonde.

706
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:11,963
- With big brown eyes.
<i>- I'll</i> bet 10-to-1 it don't last six months.

707
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:14,966
She's just like us, and we wouldn't be
stickin' around, waitin' for that guy -

708
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:17,844
- Well, well, Miss Mollie Malloy.
- Hello, Mollie.

709
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:20,763
- Hi, Mollie. How's tricks?
- I've been lookin' for you tramps.

710
00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:23,224
- Come to pay a call on Williams?
- He's right across the courtyard.

711
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:25,560
- You'd better hurry up.
- Nice roses you sent to Earl.

712
00:36:25,643 --> 00:36:27,645
What do you want done with 'em
tomorrow morning?

713
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:30,565
- A lot of wise guys, ain't you?
- You're breaking up the game, Mollie.

714
00:36:30,648 --> 00:36:32,733
- What do you want?
- I came to -

715
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:37,989
- I came to tell ya what I think of all of ya.
- Keep your shirt on.

716
00:36:38,072 --> 00:36:40,950
If you was worth breakin' my nails on,
I'd tear your face wide open.

717
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:44,871
What are you sore about?
Wasn't that a swell story we gave ya?

718
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:48,207
You crumbs have been making
a fool outta me long enough.

719
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:51,878
I never said I loved Earl Williams
and was willing to marry him on the gallows.

720
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:53,212
You made that up.

721
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:56,883
- And about my havin' a love nest with him.
- You did, didn't you?

722
00:36:56,966 --> 00:36:59,677
You've been sticking around that cuckoo
ever since they threw him in the death house.

723
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,763
- That's a lie!
- Everybody knows you're his girlfriend.

724
00:37:02,847 --> 00:37:04,640
I met Mr. Williams just once in my life.

725
00:37:04,724 --> 00:37:06,017
- How many?
- Two.

726
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,645
When he was wandering around in the rain
without his hat and coat on, like a sick dog.

727
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:11,814
- The day before the shootin'.
- Give me one.

728
00:37:11,898 --> 00:37:15,735
I went up to him like any human being would
and I asked him what was the matter.

729
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:19,906
And - And he told me about bein' fired
after bein' on the same job for 14 years.

730
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:21,574
- Who bets?
- Bet 20 cents.

731
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:24,160
I brought him up to my room
because it was warm there.

732
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:26,203
MURPHY: Oh, put it on a phonograph.

733
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:28,623
MOLLIE: Aw, listen to me, please!

734
00:37:28,706 --> 00:37:32,710
I tell ya he just sat there
talkin' to me all night.

735
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:35,171
He never once laid a hand on me.

736
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:40,134
And in the morning he went away, and I never
saw him again till that day at the trial.

737
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:42,929
- MOLLIE: Sure I was his witness!
- WILSON: And what a witness.

738
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:44,972
That's why you're persecutin' me!

739
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:48,100
Because Earl Williams treated me decent
and not like an animal, and I said so!

740
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:51,103
- This is the press room. We're busy!
- Go see your boyfriend.

741
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:54,649
- Yeah, he's got a nice room.
- He won't have it long. He left a call for 7:00 AM.

742
00:37:54,732 --> 00:37:58,653
(gasps) It's a wonder a bolt of lightning
don't come down and strike you all dead!

743
00:37:58,736 --> 00:38:00,863
(trap door slams)

744
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:11,332
What's that?

745
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:15,086
They're fixin' up a pain in the neck
for your boyfriend.

746
00:38:15,169 --> 00:38:18,255
Shame on ya. Shame on ya!

747
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:22,635
(sobs) A poor little fella
that never meant nobody no harm,

748
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:25,888
sittin' there this minute with the angel of death
beside him, and you crack a joke?

749
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:27,723
All right, get outta here.

750
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:30,351
- Take your hands off of me!
- Come on, Mollie, let's get outta here.

751
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:32,478
- They ain't human.
- I know. They're newspapermen.

752
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:35,982
All they've been doin' is lyin'.
All they've been doin' is writin' lies!

753
00:38:36,065 --> 00:38:39,068
- I know, Mollie.
- Why won't they listen to me?

754
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:41,779
MOLLIE: Why won't they listen to me?

755
00:38:53,624 --> 00:38:56,627
(rings)

756
00:38:58,671 --> 00:39:02,633
Hello? Who? Hildy Johnson?

757
00:39:02,717 --> 00:39:05,720
Hang on. She'll be back in a minute.

758
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:11,183
- You guys wanna play any more cards?
- No.

759
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:13,769
What's the use? I can't win anyway.

760
00:39:30,578 --> 00:39:32,788
Gentlemen of the press.

761
00:39:34,707 --> 00:39:37,209
Hildy, phone for ya.

762
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:40,796
Hello?

763
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,548
Oh, hello, Bruce.

764
00:39:43,716 --> 00:39:46,802
What? Where are you?

765
00:39:46,886 --> 00:39:48,721
You're where?

766
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:52,516
Well, how did that happen?
Never mind, never mind. <i>I'll</i> be right down.

767
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:57,313
Oh! I'm sorry! Sorry!

768
00:39:57,396 --> 00:40:00,066
- Ooh! Ow!
- Hiya, Sheriff. How ya doin'?

769
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:03,903
My shin! My back!
What's going on around here?

770
00:40:03,986 --> 00:40:06,697
- Bruce was in trouble.
- Lioness rushes to defend cub.

771
00:40:06,781 --> 00:40:09,200
- But -
- Man forgets hankie. Mama goes to wipe nose.

772
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:13,621
- I still give that marriage six months.
- I don't know what you fellas are talking about.

773
00:40:13,704 --> 00:40:16,749
- What do you want, Pete?
- Oh, uh, uh -

774
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:19,043
I've got the tickets
for the hanging here, boys.

775
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:20,377
- Pete?
- Huh? What?

776
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:24,340
Pete, why can't you hang this guy
at 5:00 instead of 7:00?

777
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:26,842
It won't hurt you,
and we can make the city edition.

778
00:40:26,926 --> 00:40:28,552
That's kinda raw, Roy.

779
00:40:28,636 --> 00:40:31,680
After all, I can't hang a man in his sleep
just to please a newspaper.

780
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:35,226
No, but you can reprieve him twice
so the hangings three days before election.

781
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:37,686
You can run on a law-and-order ticket.
You can do that.

782
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:40,481
Honest, boys, I had absolutely nothing
to do with those reprieves.

783
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:42,733
Yeah? How do we know there won't be
another reprieve tonight?

784
00:40:42,817 --> 00:40:45,069
What if this Egelhoffer
finds Williams insane?

785
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:47,321
He won't find him insane
because he isn't.

786
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:49,406
- He's just as sane as I am.
-(together) Saner!

787
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,534
-(all chuckling)
- Now, be serious, boys.

788
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:55,287
After all, this is a hanging,
and it's gonna go according to schedule.

789
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:57,957
7:00 in the morning
and not a minute earlier.

790
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,376
After all, there's such a thing
as being humane, you know.

791
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:02,419
All right, Pinky, wait till you want a favor.

792
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:05,047
- And please don't call me Pinky!
- Why not?

793
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:07,842
Because I got a name, see,
and it's Peter B. Hartwell.

794
00:41:07,925 --> 00:41:10,177
- What's the “B” for?
- Bull.

795
00:41:10,261 --> 00:41:14,056
But I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.
I never stole a watch in my life.

796
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,433
I know you didn't, Bruce.
All right, Mike. Let him out.

797
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:19,812
I can't, Hildy. He's accused of stealing
a watch, and they found the watch on him.

798
00:41:19,895 --> 00:41:22,273
- But I never stole -
- Please, Bruce. And who accused him?

799
00:41:22,356 --> 00:41:24,608
- Diamond Louie, the biggest crook in town.
- I know. It's no good, Hildy.

800
00:41:24,692 --> 00:41:26,777
- Don't “Hildy” me. Are you gonna let him out?
- No.

801
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:28,404
- I never stole -
- Bruce, please.

802
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:31,073
All right, you're not. Well, perhaps you'd
better read the Post in the morning.

803
00:41:31,157 --> 00:41:33,742
I can't imagine
who'd do a thing like that to me.

804
00:41:33,826 --> 00:41:36,954
- I can't think of any enemies I have.
- I'm sure you haven't any, Br -

805
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:40,166
- Have you got the check?
- Oh, yes. I have it right here.

806
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:43,294
That's a funny superstition
you newspaper people have.

807
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:45,212
Yes, isn't it?

808
00:41:45,296 --> 00:41:49,592
About being arrested, at first I thought Walter
Burns might have something to do with it.

809
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:52,636
But then, of course,
I realized he couldn't have.

810
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,847
- Why?
- Well, he's a very nice fellow, Hildy.

811
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:57,224
- Oh!
- Oh, yes. I found that out.

812
00:41:57,308 --> 00:42:00,227
- What's the matter?
- I've lost my wallet!

813
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:04,815
Yes, well, Bruce, never mind. I have the money.
You'd better give me the check too.

814
00:42:04,899 --> 00:42:07,526
- And that picture of us in Bermuda -
- Don't bother, Bruce.

815
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,945
You'll find lots of things missing.

816
00:42:12,573 --> 00:42:15,409
No, Bruce dear, you wait here.
I'm not taking any more chances.

817
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:17,661
<i>I'll</i> be down in three minutes.
We're taking the next train.

818
00:42:17,745 --> 00:42:19,163
Oh, sorry.

819
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:22,708
“And so into this little tortured mind

820
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:25,961
came the idea that that gun
had been produced for use.

821
00:42:26,045 --> 00:42:27,838
And use it he did.

822
00:42:27,922 --> 00:42:32,176
But the state has a production-for-use plan too.
It has a gallows.

823
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:34,345
And at 7:00 AM,
unless a miracle occurs,

824
00:42:34,428 --> 00:42:38,807
that gallows will be used to separate
the soul of Earl Williams from his body.

825
00:42:38,891 --> 00:42:43,270
And out of Mollie Malloy's life
will go the one kindly soul she ever knew.”

826
00:42:44,355 --> 00:42:47,024
- That's as far as she got.
-(soft whistle)

827
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:50,861
- I ask you guys, can that girl write an interview?
- She'll do till somebody else comes along.

828
00:42:50,945 --> 00:42:53,405
I don't think it's very ethical,
reading other people's stuff.

829
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:57,326
Where do you get that ethics stuff?
You're the only one who'll swipe any of it.

830
00:42:57,409 --> 00:43:00,579
I still say that anybody that can write like that
ain't gonna give it up permanently

831
00:43:00,663 --> 00:43:03,499
to sew socks for a guy
in the insurance business.

832
00:43:03,582 --> 00:43:06,710
Now I give that marriage three months,
and I'm laying 3-to-1. Any takers?

833
00:43:06,794 --> 00:43:08,045
HILDY: I'll take that bet.

834
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:11,799
It's getting so a girl can't leave the room without
being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.

835
00:43:11,882 --> 00:43:14,635
Hello, Post, get me Walter Burns,
will you, please?

836
00:43:14,718 --> 00:43:19,098
Don't get sore, Hildy. We were only saying
a swell reporter like you wouldn't quit so easy.

837
00:43:19,181 --> 00:43:20,766
This is Hildy Johnson.

838
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:23,269
I can quit, all right,
without a single quiver.

839
00:43:23,352 --> 00:43:25,980
I'm gonna live like a human being,
not like you chumps.

840
00:43:26,063 --> 00:43:28,524
Is that you, Walter?
Oh, I've got some news for you.

841
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:31,944
Yes, I got the interview, all right,
but I've got some more important news.

842
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:35,864
Perhaps you'd better get a pencil
and take it down. All ready?

843
00:43:35,948 --> 00:43:38,284
Now get this,
you double-crossing chimpanzee.

844
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,619
There ain't gonna be any interview,
and there ain't gonna be any story.

845
00:43:40,703 --> 00:43:42,955
And that certified check of yours
is leaving with me in 2O minutes.

846
00:43:43,038 --> 00:43:45,791
I wouldn't cover the burning of Rome for you
if they were just lighting it up.

847
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:48,210
If I ever lay my two eyes on you again,
I'm gonna walk right up to you

848
00:43:48,294 --> 00:43:51,463
and hammer on that monkey skull of yours
till it rings like a Chinese gong.

849
00:43:51,547 --> 00:43:53,507
Oh, so you don't know
why I'm angry with you?

850
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:56,302
Perhaps you'd better get Louie
to tell you the story of his watch.

851
00:43:56,385 --> 00:43:58,595
There's just one other thing
I want you to listen to.

852
00:44:01,056 --> 00:44:03,851
Hear that? That's the story I just wrote.

853
00:44:03,934 --> 00:44:08,063
Yes, I know we had a bargain. I said
I'd write it. I didn't say I wouldn't tear it up.

854
00:44:08,147 --> 00:44:11,942
It's all in little pieces now, Walter,
and I hope to do the same for you someday.

855
00:44:12,026 --> 00:44:14,236
And that, my friends,
is my farewell to the newspaper game.

856
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,363
I'm gonna be a woman,
not a news-getting machine.

857
00:44:16,447 --> 00:44:18,824
I'm gonna have babies, take care of 'em,
give 'em cod-liver oil

858
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:20,451
and watch their teeth grow and... and...

859
00:44:20,576 --> 00:44:23,662
- If I ever see one of 'em look at a
newspaper, I'm gonna brain 'em. -(ringing)

860
00:44:23,746 --> 00:44:26,373
- Where's my hat?
- Hello? Hello?

861
00:44:26,457 --> 00:44:29,043
- Oh, Mr. Burns? Yes, she's still here.
- Give me that!

862
00:44:31,462 --> 00:44:33,130
And another thing I wanna - Oh!

863
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:34,548
Ooh, you -

864
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:36,925
Where is my -
Oh, there it is.

865
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:39,678
- Hello, Doctor. Sorry to be late.
- That's quite all right.

866
00:44:39,762 --> 00:44:42,181
These boys from the newspapers,
they take up so much of my time.

867
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:44,933
They wanted me to hang Williams
at their convenience.

868
00:44:45,017 --> 00:44:46,977
- Oh, hello, Earl.
- Hello.

869
00:44:47,061 --> 00:44:49,396
These newspapers,
what they did to me in Chicago.

870
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,398
- Always after me for interviews.
- Yes, me too.

871
00:44:51,482 --> 00:44:54,651
Of course, I did rather promise to make them
some sort of statement when I finished here.

872
00:44:54,735 --> 00:44:57,071
- You don't mind, do you?
- Well, that's hardly ethical, Doctor.

873
00:44:57,154 --> 00:44:59,365
- Oh?
- All statements are supposed to come from me.

874
00:44:59,448 --> 00:45:02,743
Well, what do you say
to giving them some sort of joint interview?

875
00:45:02,826 --> 00:45:05,746
I can discuss some of the psychological
aspects of the case and you -

876
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:09,333
- We'd have our pictures taken together?
- Yes, yes, shaking hands.

877
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:11,335
Of course,
I don't take a very good picture.

878
00:45:11,418 --> 00:45:13,754
That doesn't matter, Doctor.
The publicity is the main thing.

879
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:18,008
Doctor, I'm getting awful tired.
Can't I go back to jail again?

880
00:45:18,092 --> 00:45:22,054
I'm sorry. I forgot you were there.
No, we've some further questions for you.

881
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:24,306
- Sheriff, do you mind extinguishing the lights?
- Of course, Doctor.

882
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:26,809
That'll help us
with what we have to do over here.

883
00:45:26,892 --> 00:45:28,560
Now, let me see.

884
00:45:29,937 --> 00:45:33,399
Mr. Williams, you know, of course,
that you're going to be executed.

885
00:45:33,482 --> 00:45:36,360
Now, who do you feel
is responsible for that?

886
00:45:36,443 --> 00:45:39,196
I'm innocent. It wasn't my fault.

887
00:45:39,279 --> 00:45:40,989
- Well, Murph.
- Send us a postcard.

888
00:45:41,073 --> 00:45:42,741
- That <i>I'll</i> do.
- So long, “Yonson.”

889
00:45:42,825 --> 00:45:44,243
When'll we see ya again, “Yonson”?

890
00:45:44,326 --> 00:45:48,038
Next time you see me, I shall be riding in
a Rolls-Royce, giving interviews on success.

891
00:45:48,122 --> 00:45:50,124
- Good-bye!
- So long, you wage-slaves.

892
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:53,669
When you're crawling up fire escapes
and getting kicked out of front doors

893
00:45:53,752 --> 00:45:57,714
and eating Christmas dinners in one-arm joints,
don't forget your pal, Hildy Johnson.

894
00:45:57,798 --> 00:46:00,426
- We won't.
- When the road beyond unfolds -

895
00:46:00,509 --> 00:46:04,138
(gunfire)

896
00:46:04,221 --> 00:46:06,265
(alarm ringing)

897
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:09,518
- (gunfire continues)
- Look out! It's a jailbreak!

898
00:46:12,938 --> 00:46:16,233
- What's the matter? What happened?
- (gunfire)

899
00:46:16,316 --> 00:46:18,652
Hey, watch
where you're aimin', will ya?

900
00:46:18,735 --> 00:46:20,571
MAN: Block the gate! <i>He'll</i> try the gate!

901
00:46:20,654 --> 00:46:22,948
- Who got away? Who was it?
- Earl Williams!

902
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:25,242
(excited chattering)

903
00:46:26,285 --> 00:46:28,996
- Hello. Hurry up. This is important.
- Give me the desk.

904
00:46:29,121 --> 00:46:31,206
- Flash. Earl Williams just escaped.
- Jailbreak. - Don't know yet.

905
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:33,000
- Call you back. - Williams took a powder.
- Went over the wall.

906
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:34,835
- I don't know anything yet!
- Call ya back.

907
00:46:34,918 --> 00:46:36,879
-(gunfire continues)
-(siren wailing)

908
00:46:40,424 --> 00:46:43,760
Hello, Post, get me Walter Burns quick.
It's Hildy Johnson.

909
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:47,973
Walter? Walter, Hildy. Earl Williams
just escaped from the county jail.

910
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:51,059
Yeah, yeah. Yeah!
Don't worry. I'm on the job.

911
00:46:54,605 --> 00:46:56,231
(sirens continue wailing)

912
00:47:06,325 --> 00:47:09,703
Hey, Cooley! Wait!

913
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:13,165
Hey <i>'</i>

914
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:15,709
Hey! Wait a minute!

915
00:47:34,144 --> 00:47:36,104
Cooley! I wanna talk to you.

916
00:47:36,188 --> 00:47:38,982
(phone ringing)

917
00:47:42,444 --> 00:47:45,739
(phones ringing)

918
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:48,283
- This is Endicott. Give me rewrite.
-(ringing)

919
00:47:48,367 --> 00:47:52,955
He ain't here. Hello, Gil?
Here's the situation now. You ready?

920
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:54,998
Williams was taken over
to the sheriffs private office

921
00:47:55,082 --> 00:47:57,084
to be examined
by this Professor Egelhoffer.

922
00:47:57,167 --> 00:48:00,629
In a few minutes he shot his way out.
Nobody knows where he got the gun.

923
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:03,173
He went upstairs to the infirmary
and got out through the skylight.

924
00:48:03,257 --> 00:48:06,593
He must have slid down the rain pipe to
the street. Nobody knows where he got it.

925
00:48:06,677 --> 00:48:08,762
- If they do, they won't talk.
- Hello, sweetheart. Give me the desk.

926
00:48:08,845 --> 00:48:11,014
Crime commission offers
$10,000 reward for Williams' capture.

927
00:48:11,098 --> 00:48:13,684
No clue yet as to Williams'
whereabouts. No, no.

928
00:48:13,767 --> 00:48:16,436
Here's a little feature though. There's
been an accident about a tear bomb.

929
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,772
Yeah, tear bomb, tear bomb.
Criminals cry for it.

930
00:48:18,855 --> 00:48:20,440
I don't know.

931
00:48:20,524 --> 00:48:23,569
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the
hands of Sheriff Hartwell's bombing squad.

932
00:48:23,652 --> 00:48:24,736
What went off?

933
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,446
The following deputies
were rushed to the hospital.

934
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:27,948
Fine friend you are.

935
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:30,367
Their names are Mervvyn D. Wilkerson,
the mayor's brother-in-law.

936
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:33,120
- After all I've done for you.
- Howard Schuster, the sheriffs uncle.

937
00:48:33,203 --> 00:48:34,955
- On his mother's side.
- WILSON: Hello, Jim?

938
00:48:35,038 --> 00:48:36,957
Sidelights
on Sheriff Hartwell's manhunt.

939
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,501
William Mansfield, the sheriffs landlord,
and Lester Winthrop,

940
00:48:39,585 --> 00:48:41,128
who married the sheriffs niece.

941
00:48:41,211 --> 00:48:43,171
You remember, the very homely dame.
Call ya back.

942
00:48:43,255 --> 00:48:46,425
Mrs. William Rice, age 55, scrub lady,
while scrubbing the eighth floor,

943
00:48:46,508 --> 00:48:48,677
was shot in the left leg
by one of Sheriff Hartwell's deputies.

944
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,554
- Look, I'm not -
-(gunfire)

945
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:53,390
- There goes another scrub lady!
- It was only a flesh wound.

946
00:48:53,473 --> 00:48:56,268
- They took her to the hospital.
- McCue speaking. Give me the desk.

947
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:58,020
Mac, any dope on how he escaped?

948
00:48:58,103 --> 00:49:00,314
Maybe the sheriff let him out
so Williams could vote for him.

949
00:49:00,397 --> 00:49:02,941
A man answering the description
of Earl Williams was seen boarding -

950
00:49:03,025 --> 00:49:05,611
-(gunfire)
- Call ya back!

951
00:49:05,694 --> 00:49:08,363
- Thought you'd gone.
- I thought so too.

952
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:10,490
Get me Walter Burns, quick.

953
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:15,203
Walter, Walter, listen.

954
00:49:15,287 --> 00:49:17,914
I've got the whole story on how
Williams got that gun and escaped.

955
00:49:17,998 --> 00:49:21,668
And I got it exclusive.
Yeah. That's right, and it's a pip.

956
00:49:21,752 --> 00:49:24,296
It cost me 450 bucks
to tear it out of Cooley.

957
00:49:24,379 --> 00:49:25,756
Never mind that. What's the story?

958
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,466
Just a minute,
and I'll give you the story.

959
00:49:27,549 --> 00:49:30,969
I had to give him all the money I had,
and it wasn't exactly mine.

960
00:49:31,053 --> 00:49:32,888
It's Bruce's money, and I want it back.

961
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:37,684
Bruce's money? Sure, sure, sure,
you'll get it. Now, what's the story?

962
00:49:37,768 --> 00:49:40,854
<i>I'll</i> send the money right down to you.
I swear it on my mother's grave.

963
00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:44,107
All right, here's the -
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.

964
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:46,777
My grandmother's grave.
Don't be technical. What's the story?

965
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:51,031
You get that money down here.
All right, here's your story.

966
00:49:51,114 --> 00:49:52,532
The jailbreak of your dreams.

967
00:49:52,616 --> 00:49:55,494
It seems this expert Dr. Egelhoffer,
the profound thinker from New York,

968
00:49:55,577 --> 00:49:58,080
was giving Williams a final sanity test
in the sheriffs office.

969
00:49:58,163 --> 00:50:01,667
You know, sticking a lot of pins in him
so he could get his reflexes.

970
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:04,795
He decided to reenact the crime
exactly as it had taken place

971
00:50:04,878 --> 00:50:07,631
in order to study Williams's
powers of coordination.

972
00:50:07,714 --> 00:50:11,176
I'm coming to it. Of course, he had
to have a gun to reenact the crime with.

973
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:15,347
Who do you suppose supplied it?
Peter B. Hartwell - “B” for brains.

974
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:18,266
(snorts, laughing) No kidding!

975
00:50:19,601 --> 00:50:22,437
I tell you, I'm not kidding. I'm not
good enough to make this one up.

976
00:50:22,521 --> 00:50:25,107
The sheriff gave his gun to the professor.
The professor gave it to Earl.

977
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:27,234
Earl shot the professor
right in the classified ads.

978
00:50:27,317 --> 00:50:30,529
No, ads. Ain't it perfect?

979
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:33,782
If the sheriff had unrolled a red carpet
and loaned Williams an umbrella,

980
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:35,325
it couldn't have been more ideal.

981
00:50:35,409 --> 00:50:37,744
Who? Oh, no, no.
Egelhoffer wasn't badly hurt.

982
00:50:37,828 --> 00:50:40,580
They took him to the county hospital
where they're awfully afraid <i>he'll</i> recover.

983
00:50:40,664 --> 00:50:42,708
Oh, that's great work, Hildy. Huh?

984
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:45,585
Stop worrying about the money.
I'll see you get it in 15 minutes.

985
00:50:45,669 --> 00:50:48,964
I'd better get it in 15 minutes.
Bruce is waiting in a taxicab for me.

986
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:52,384
- We're in a hurry.
- Hold on a minute. Hey, come here.

987
00:50:52,467 --> 00:50:55,512
There's a guy waiting in a taxi
in front of the criminal courts building.

988
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:57,514
- His name is Bruce Baldwin.
- What does he look like?

989
00:50:57,597 --> 00:51:00,350
He looks like that fellow in the movies.
You know, Ralph Bellamy.

990
00:51:00,434 --> 00:51:01,977
- Oh, him?
- Can you handle it?

991
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,062
I've never flopped on ya yet, have I?

992
00:51:04,146 --> 00:51:07,107
Come on. Get going.
You only got about two minutes. Hurry.

993
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:09,901
Yes, dear. Sorry to keep you waiting.
How much was it again?

994
00:51:09,985 --> 00:51:12,738
$450? Just a second.

995
00:51:12,821 --> 00:51:16,408
Louie, I need $450 worth
of counterfeit money.

996
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:17,909
Can't carry that much.

997
00:51:17,993 --> 00:51:20,078
Just the 450 counterfeit.
Where can I get it?

998
00:51:20,162 --> 00:51:23,373
- Oh, I got that on me.
- Quite a coincidence. Take it over to Hildy.

999
00:51:23,457 --> 00:51:25,876
Hello. It's coming right over.
I'm sending it over with Louie.

1000
00:51:25,959 --> 00:51:28,378
Thanks for your story, dear,
and good luck on your honeymoon.

1001
00:51:28,462 --> 00:51:31,882
No, no, never mind the thanks.
Just see that money gets here.

1002
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,763
- Hello, Hildy. You still here?
- No, I'm in Niagara Falls.

1003
00:51:37,846 --> 00:51:41,725
McCue speaking. Emil, I got a good
feature for you on the manhunt.

1004
00:51:41,808 --> 00:51:45,187
Ready? Mrs. Phoebe DeWolfe,
861 1/2 South State Street, colored,

1005
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:47,189
gave birth to a pickaninny
in a patrol wagon

1006
00:51:47,272 --> 00:51:50,066
with Sheriff Hartwell's
special rifle squad acting as nurses.

1007
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:53,737
Phoebe was walking along the street
when - That's right. Yeah.

1008
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:56,865
So they coaxed her into the patrol wagon
and started a race with the stork.

1009
00:51:56,948 --> 00:52:00,827
When the pickaninny was born, the rifle squad
examined him to see if it was Earl Williams.

1010
00:52:00,911 --> 00:52:02,537
Well, they knew
he was hiding somewhere.

1011
00:52:02,621 --> 00:52:04,581
-(phone rings)
- Here's the payoff.

1012
00:52:04,664 --> 00:52:08,502
- They named the kid Peter Hartwell DeWolfe.
- Press room.

1013
00:52:08,585 --> 00:52:11,505
Bruce! I thought
you were downstairs in the -

1014
00:52:11,588 --> 00:52:15,342
What? Arrested again?
What for this time?

1015
00:52:15,425 --> 00:52:19,304
Oh, well, they called it mashing.

1016
00:52:20,472 --> 00:52:23,016
No! I didn't, Hildy.

1017
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:25,685
I was sitting right in the taxi
where you left me.

1018
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:30,232
The young lady seemed
to have a dizzy spell and I just -

1019
00:52:30,315 --> 00:52:32,067
Huh?

1020
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:35,570
Well, uh, she's kind of, uh -

1021
00:52:35,654 --> 00:52:37,572
Huh?

1022
00:52:37,656 --> 00:52:41,159
Yes, she's a blonde. Yes, very blonde.

1023
00:52:41,243 --> 00:52:44,204
Never mind.
I know how it happened. Just a minute.

1024
00:52:44,287 --> 00:52:47,249
Get me Walter Burns. Hildy Johnson.

1025
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:50,794
Bruce, where are ya? 27th Precinct?
Hold on a minute, will ya?

1026
00:52:50,877 --> 00:52:54,548
Walter, you -
Well, he was there a minute ago.

1027
00:52:54,631 --> 00:52:58,176
But, I - (mimicking)
Sorry, I can't locate him, Miss Johnson.

1028
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:00,720
Why, that double-crossing -
Hello - No, not you.

1029
00:53:00,804 --> 00:53:04,182
Bruce, I can't get there right away.
How about 20 minutes?

1030
00:53:04,266 --> 00:53:08,144
You see, I have to wait here for the -
Uh, <i>I'll</i> tell you when I see you.

1031
00:53:08,228 --> 00:53:10,564
If I ever get my two hands again
on that Walter Burns -

1032
00:53:10,647 --> 00:53:13,441
- Hold on a minute. Anything I can do to help?
- How much money you got?

1033
00:53:13,525 --> 00:53:14,734
-$1.80.
- Sixty-four cents.

1034
00:53:14,818 --> 00:53:17,571
- Welcome to it.
- Thanks. You'd better buy an annuity.

1035
00:53:17,654 --> 00:53:21,074
What's that, Emil? No, I can't
give you an official statement.

1036
00:53:21,157 --> 00:53:23,827
No. Wait a minute. Here's the mayor.
Maybe he'll give us one.

1037
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,787
- How 'bout a statement, Mayor?
- Don't pester me now.

1038
00:53:25,871 --> 00:53:28,206
- I've got a lot on my mind.
- His Honor won't say anything.

1039
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:30,292
- Have you seen Sheriff Hartwell?
- It's hard to tell.

1040
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:32,210
There's so many cockroaches
around here -

1041
00:53:32,294 --> 00:53:34,254
Wait a minute.
How about a statement, Your Honor?

1042
00:53:34,337 --> 00:53:38,008
- Sure, we go to press in 20 minutes.
- I have nothing to say. Not at this time.

1043
00:53:38,091 --> 00:53:40,218
Just a moment, please.
What do you know about the escape?

1044
00:53:40,302 --> 00:53:41,928
How'd he get out?
Where'd he get the gun?

1045
00:53:42,012 --> 00:53:44,598
- Wait a minute, boys. Not so fast.
- Give us a statement on the election then.

1046
00:53:44,681 --> 00:53:47,183
- What effect will this have on the voters?
- None whatsoever.

1047
00:53:47,267 --> 00:53:50,729
How can an unavoidable misfortune
like this have any influence

1048
00:53:50,812 --> 00:53:52,981
on the upright citizens of our fair city?

1049
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:54,733
- Baloney.
- Look, Mr. Mayor, please.

1050
00:53:54,816 --> 00:53:56,735
Is there a red menace or ain't there?

1051
00:53:56,818 --> 00:53:58,778
How did Williams
get out of that rubber jail?

1052
00:53:58,862 --> 00:54:01,448
Have you learned to stand the gaff, or have you
picked somebody to be responsible?

1053
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:04,159
Is there any truth in the report
you're on Stalin's payroll?

1054
00:54:04,242 --> 00:54:06,912
Yeah, the senator claims
you sleep in red underwear.

1055
00:54:06,995 --> 00:54:11,458
Never mind the jokes. Don't forget
I'm the mayor. Hartwell, I wanna see you!

1056
00:54:11,541 --> 00:54:14,127
How'd he get away?
Where'd he get the gun?

1057
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:16,838
Hi, Your Honor. Any statement
on the red uprising tomorrow?

1058
00:54:16,922 --> 00:54:19,174
- What red uprising?
- There'll be no red uprising.

1059
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:21,676
The governor says
the situation calls for the militia.

1060
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,637
- Get me rewrite.
- You can quote me.

1061
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,056
Anything the governor says
is a tissue of lies.

1062
00:54:26,139 --> 00:54:28,892
Hello, Jake. Here's a red-hot
statement from the governor.

1063
00:54:28,975 --> 00:54:31,394
He claims the mayor and sheriff
have shown themselves

1064
00:54:31,478 --> 00:54:35,023
to be a couple of eight-year-olds
playing with fire, yeah.

1065
00:54:35,815 --> 00:54:37,692
You can quote him as follows -

1066
00:54:37,776 --> 00:54:41,112
“lt is a lucky thing for the city
that next Tuesday is election day,

1067
00:54:41,196 --> 00:54:45,408
as the citizens will thus be saved the expense
of impeaching the mayor and the sheriff.”

1068
00:54:45,492 --> 00:54:48,954
That's all. Call ya back.
Nice to have seen ya, Mayor.

1069
00:54:49,037 --> 00:54:51,581
- Excuse me, boys, I've got so much to do.
- Quit stalling, Pinky!

1070
00:54:51,665 --> 00:54:53,208
- Who engineered this?
- Was it the Reds?

1071
00:54:53,291 --> 00:54:54,584
- No!
- Who was it? You?

1072
00:54:54,668 --> 00:54:57,212
- Me? No! I've got him located.
- Williams?

1073
00:54:57,295 --> 00:55:00,215
- Where?
- Where he used to live. I just got a tip.

1074
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:02,926
- Why didn't you say so?
- The rifle squad is just going out.

1075
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:05,303
- Get me outta here!
- Catch them if you hurry. Please.

1076
00:55:05,387 --> 00:55:08,306
- Pete, I wanna talk to you.
- I have got so much to do.

1077
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:10,433
- Now, see here, Fred.
- Pete, you're through.

1078
00:55:10,517 --> 00:55:14,145
- You mean I'm through?
- I'm scratching your name off the ticket.

1079
00:55:14,229 --> 00:55:16,314
I'm running Sherman in your place.

1080
00:55:16,398 --> 00:55:19,651
“Reform the Reds with a rope.”
Williams isn't a Red, and you know it.

1081
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:21,778
There are a lot of communistic
sympathizers around.

1082
00:55:21,861 --> 00:55:23,947
I thought if I got a slogan like that,
I could -

1083
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:26,700
I know it, but that's got nothing
to do with this case.

1084
00:55:26,783 --> 00:55:29,035
-(knocking)
- There are 200,000 votes at stake.

1085
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:30,870
If Earl Williams don't hang,
we're gonna lose 'em.

1086
00:55:30,954 --> 00:55:33,581
We're going to hang him. Come in!
He can't get away.

1087
00:55:33,665 --> 00:55:36,084
What do you mean? He did get away!

1088
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:38,044
- What do you want?
- I - Uh -

1089
00:55:38,128 --> 00:55:40,338
- What do you want?
- Are you Sheriff Hartwell?

1090
00:55:40,422 --> 00:55:42,048
I'm he. What is it?

1091
00:55:42,132 --> 00:55:45,719
You're a hard man to find, Sheriff.
I have a message here from the governor.

1092
00:55:45,802 --> 00:55:48,555
- What's from the governor?
- It was a reprieve for Earl Williams.

1093
00:55:48,638 --> 00:55:50,473
- For who?
- Earl Williams' reprieve.

1094
00:55:50,557 --> 00:55:52,976
- You said there wasn't gonna be a reprieve.
- I didn't know about this.

1095
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:55,520
It frightens me to think
of what I'd like to do to you.

1096
00:55:55,603 --> 00:55:58,023
- Who else was there when he gave you this?
- Nobody. He was out fishing.

1097
00:55:58,106 --> 00:56:01,317
- Get the governor on the phone.
- He's not there. He's out duck shooting.

1098
00:56:01,401 --> 00:56:03,737
- Bought a red hat.
- Duck shooting.

1099
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:06,489
A guy who's done nothing
for the last 40 years but play pinochle

1100
00:56:06,573 --> 00:56:08,908
gets elected governor
and thinks he's a Tarzan.

1101
00:56:08,992 --> 00:56:12,454
Read that! “insane,” he says!
He knows Williams isn't insane.

1102
00:56:12,537 --> 00:56:14,873
- I never met the man.
- Ah! Pure politics.

1103
00:56:14,956 --> 00:56:17,625
It's an attempt to ruin us.
We gotta think fast.

1104
00:56:17,709 --> 00:56:20,837
- What are we gonna tell the reporters?
- The party's through on account of you.

1105
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,132
- Oh, Fred!
- Tell 'em I want your resignation now.

1106
00:56:24,215 --> 00:56:26,676
Hello? Yes. Yes, this is Hartwell.

1107
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,261
What? Where? Where?

1108
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,014
- Holy Moses! Hold the wire!
- What is it?

1109
00:56:31,097 --> 00:56:34,476
They've got him.
They've got Williams surrounded at his house!

1110
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,062
- Tell them to hold the phone.
- I did. Hold the wire!

1111
00:56:37,145 --> 00:56:39,355
- Cover up that transmitter!
- Cover up -

1112
00:56:39,439 --> 00:56:43,026
- Listen. You never arrived with this.
- Yes, I did. Remember?

1113
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:46,112
- I came through that door.
- How much money do you make?

1114
00:56:46,196 --> 00:56:47,322
- Huh?
- What's your salary?

1115
00:56:47,405 --> 00:56:50,241
- Forty dollars a week.
- How'd you like to make $350 a month?

1116
00:56:50,325 --> 00:56:53,745
- Almost $100 a week.
- No, I couldn't afford - Who, me?

1117
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:57,165
Who do you think? They need a fellow
like you in the city sealer's office.

1118
00:56:57,248 --> 00:56:58,750
- In the what?
- City sealer's.

1119
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:00,877
- I should work -
- Wait a minute! I'm in conference!

1120
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,046
- My wife wouldn't want me to do that.
- Why not?

1121
00:57:03,129 --> 00:57:05,840
- My wife lives in the country with my family.
- That's all right.

1122
00:57:05,924 --> 00:57:08,259
Bring her in here.
We'll pay all the expenses.

1123
00:57:08,343 --> 00:57:11,137
- No, I don't think so.
- For heaven's sakes, why not?

1124
00:57:11,221 --> 00:57:14,641
I got two kids going to school. if they
change towns, they lose a grade.

1125
00:57:14,724 --> 00:57:16,601
No, they won't. They'll skip a grade.

1126
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:19,187
<i>I'll</i> guarantee ya
they'll graduate with highest honors.

1127
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:21,106
Hold your horses!
Hurry up, Fred.

1128
00:57:21,189 --> 00:57:22,816
What do you say?

1129
00:57:22,899 --> 00:57:25,401
- Puts me in a kind of peculiar hole.
- No, it doesn't.

1130
00:57:25,485 --> 00:57:27,362
- Remember, you never delivered this.
- Yes, I did.

1131
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:29,948
- No, you got caught in the traffic.
- No, I came -

1132
00:57:30,031 --> 00:57:32,826
Pretend you did. Get out.
Don't let anybody see ya.

1133
00:57:32,909 --> 00:57:34,869
- Wait a minute.
- But how do I know -

1134
00:57:34,953 --> 00:57:37,205
Come in and see me tomorrow.
What's your name?

1135
00:57:37,288 --> 00:57:38,915
- Pettibone. What's yours?
- Pettibone?

1136
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:40,041
- Really?
- No.

1137
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:42,502
All you've got to do is lay low
and keep your mouth shut.

1138
00:57:42,585 --> 00:57:44,170
- I'm tired anyhow.
- Go to this address.

1139
00:57:44,254 --> 00:57:47,590
Homey place. They'll take good care
of ya. Tell 'em Fred sent ya.

1140
00:57:47,674 --> 00:57:51,010
- Here's $50 on account.
- Will ya wait, Olsen? <i>I'll</i> tell ya in one minute.

1141
00:57:51,094 --> 00:57:53,763
- You forgot to tell me what a city sealer does.
<i>- I'll</i> explain tomorrow.

1142
00:57:53,847 --> 00:57:55,682
- Is it hard?
- No, no, easy. Very easy.

1143
00:57:55,765 --> 00:57:57,976
That's good, because my health isn't -
My wife -

1144
00:57:58,059 --> 00:57:59,686
- We'll fix that too.
- My wife?

1145
00:57:59,769 --> 00:58:03,231
- Yeah, fix anything. Go ahead.
- Fred, they're still on the phone.

1146
00:58:03,314 --> 00:58:05,483
- All right, tell 'em to shoot to kill.
- What?

1147
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:07,527
- You heard what I said.
- But the reprieve, Fred.

1148
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:10,864
- Do as I tell ya.
- Hello, Olsen? Shoot to kill.

1149
00:58:10,947 --> 00:58:13,658
- That's the orders. Pass the word along.
- $500 reward.

1150
00:58:13,741 --> 00:58:17,078
$500 to the man who does it.
<i>I'll</i> be right over.

1151
00:58:18,913 --> 00:58:20,415
Hi, Hildy.

1152
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:22,792
- You double-crossing hyena, I'd like to -
- What's the matter?

1153
00:58:22,876 --> 00:58:25,461
Don't give me that innocent stuff. What
did you pull on Mr. Baldwin this time?

1154
00:58:25,545 --> 00:58:27,088
- Who, me?
- You and that albino of yours.

1155
00:58:27,172 --> 00:58:28,673
- You talkin' about Evangeline?
- None other.

1156
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:31,801
She ain't no albino. She was born
right here in this country.

1157
00:58:31,885 --> 00:58:34,053
She tries anything else,
she'll have to stay here in this country.

1158
00:58:34,137 --> 00:58:36,264
And you, too, and it won't be
on a phony charge either.

1159
00:58:36,347 --> 00:58:37,974
- Did you bring that money?
- Oh, yeah.

1160
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:40,935
-400 bucks.
-450.

1161
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:44,480
All right.
You can't blame a guy for tryin'.

1162
00:58:44,564 --> 00:58:46,733
- Better give me a receipt.
- I'll give you a scar.

1163
00:58:46,816 --> 00:58:49,611
- I got plenty of them.
- Oh, and <i>I'll</i> take Mr. Baldwin's wallet too.

1164
00:58:49,694 --> 00:58:52,530
- Mr. Baldwin's what?
- His purse. Come on. Come on, Louie.

1165
00:58:52,614 --> 00:58:55,909
All right, Hildy.
I'll do it for you because I like you.

1166
00:58:55,992 --> 00:58:59,037
But you better tell that financier
to be more careful in these hard times.

1167
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,873
Sure, sure. Want him to carry
your brass knuckles too?

1168
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:05,084
Don't talk that way. Here, I'll take that.
I'll take it to the station.

1169
00:59:05,168 --> 00:59:07,587
Wait a minute. You'll take it
over to the station, all right.

1170
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:10,423
You'll take it to the 27th Precinct and
tell the cops how this all happened.

1171
00:59:10,506 --> 00:59:12,342
Burns would have me
in Alcatraz in an hour.

1172
00:59:12,425 --> 00:59:14,010
- That's not a bad idea.
- Here, catch.

1173
00:59:14,093 --> 00:59:15,595
Louie!

1174
00:59:24,103 --> 00:59:26,940
Hello, Operator. Hildy Johnson.
Will you get me -

1175
00:59:27,023 --> 00:59:28,816
Drop that phone.

1176
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,027
Never mind.

1177
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:33,071
You're not gonna tell anybody
where I am.

1178
00:59:37,033 --> 00:59:38,993
Put that gun down, Earl.

1179
00:59:41,246 --> 00:59:43,873
You don't want to shoot me, Earl.
I'm your friend, remember?

1180
00:59:43,957 --> 00:59:46,292
I'm gonna write the story on you
and production for use.

1181
00:59:46,376 --> 00:59:49,545
Oh, yes. That's right.
Production for use.

1182
00:59:49,629 --> 00:59:51,714
- You don't want to hurt your friend -
- Don't move!

1183
00:59:51,798 --> 00:59:55,009
Maybe you're my friend and maybe
you're not, but don't come any nearer.

1184
00:59:55,093 --> 00:59:58,137
- You can't trust anybody in this crazy world.
-(phone ringing)

1185
00:59:58,221 --> 01:00:01,266
I don't blame you, Earl. If I were you,
I wouldn't trust anybody either.

1186
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:03,935
Don't do that.
Put it back! Put it back!

1187
01:00:04,018 --> 01:00:08,147
If you try any tricks, I'll shoot you.
I can do it right from here.

1188
01:00:08,231 --> 01:00:10,400
S-Sure you could, Earl.

1189
01:00:10,483 --> 01:00:13,611
But you don't want to do that.
You don't want to kill anybody.

1190
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:17,073
No, you're right.
I don't want to kill anybody.

1191
01:00:17,156 --> 01:00:20,201
- That's what I thought.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?

1192
01:00:20,285 --> 01:00:22,829
I was just going to close the door
so nobody's see you.

1193
01:00:22,912 --> 01:00:25,081
No, you weren't.
You were gonna get somebody.

1194
01:00:25,164 --> 01:00:27,667
But I don't want that.
All I want is to be left alone.

1195
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:30,461
- I won't get anybody.
- Yes, you will. You'll get 'em after me again.

1196
01:00:30,545 --> 01:00:32,880
- I won't let you do that!
-(shade rattling)

1197
01:00:33,923 --> 01:00:35,633
-(gun clicking)
- Give me that.

1198
01:00:35,717 --> 01:00:39,304
I guess I fired all the shells.
Oh, I'm awful tired.

1199
01:00:39,387 --> 01:00:41,889
- I couldn't go through -
- That shot. They'll know you're here!

1200
01:00:41,973 --> 01:00:45,310
- I don't care. I'm not afraid to die.
- Stop it.

1201
01:00:45,393 --> 01:00:47,770
I was telling the fella that
when he handed me the gun.

1202
01:00:47,854 --> 01:00:49,772
- Be quiet.
- Waking me up in the middle of the night.

1203
01:00:49,856 --> 01:00:51,941
Talking to me about things
they don't understand.

1204
01:00:52,025 --> 01:00:55,445
- Shut up.
- I wish they'd take me back and hang me.

1205
01:00:55,528 --> 01:00:57,363
They will if you don't keep quiet.

1206
01:00:57,447 --> 01:01:00,742
- I couldn't go through another day like this.
- Maybe you think I could.

1207
01:01:01,617 --> 01:01:03,619
- Get me Walter Burns, quick!
-(phone ringing)

1208
01:01:03,703 --> 01:01:05,830
Tell him I need him.

1209
01:01:06,331 --> 01:01:07,915
Hello, hello.

1210
01:01:07,999 --> 01:01:11,794
Bruce, I know I said I'd be down in 20 minutes,
but something terrific has happened. Hold on.

1211
01:01:11,878 --> 01:01:14,756
Walter, come over here! Bruce,
just a second. I'll explain everything.

1212
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:18,885
Walter, I got Earl Williams right in
the press room. Hurry! I need you. Right.

1213
01:01:18,968 --> 01:01:21,220
I've captured Earl Williams.
You know, the murderer!

1214
01:01:21,304 --> 01:01:23,723
-(knocking)
- Stay down, Earl. Wait a minute!

1215
01:01:23,806 --> 01:01:27,101
Bruce, as soon as I hand him over
to the paper, I'll be right down.

1216
01:01:27,185 --> 01:01:29,145
- Bruce, I can't! Don't you realize -
-(pounding on door)

1217
01:01:29,228 --> 01:01:31,439
- Come on! Let me in!
- Who is it?

1218
01:01:31,522 --> 01:01:34,359
It's me, Mollie Malloy.
Open the door!

1219
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,612
- What do you want, Mollie?
- I gotta find -

1220
01:01:37,695 --> 01:01:39,697
- Where is everybody?
- They're not here. They've all gone.

1221
01:01:39,781 --> 01:01:42,700
- Please tell me where they've gone.
- I don't know. I'm busy.

1222
01:01:42,784 --> 01:01:44,786
- Do you mind running along?
- They got him surrounded.

1223
01:01:44,869 --> 01:01:47,872
- They're gonna shoot him down like a dog.
- They're lookin' for you too. Get out.

1224
01:01:47,955 --> 01:01:50,750
I don't care!
You gotta tell me. I ain't afraid -

1225
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:53,669
All right, <i>I'll</i> tell ya.
They're down at Center and Fourth.

1226
01:01:53,753 --> 01:01:56,547
- Oh, that's where he used to -
- EARL: Mollie. Mollie, don't go.

1227
01:01:56,631 --> 01:01:59,092
Oh, come in, Mollie. Draw up a chair.

1228
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:03,846
- Hello, Mollie.
- How did you get in here?

1229
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:07,308
Down the pipe. I didn't mean
to shoot him. Really I didn't.

1230
01:02:07,392 --> 01:02:09,519
- I know.
- HILDY (whispering): Shh. Be quiet.

1231
01:02:09,602 --> 01:02:12,146
- You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
- Sure, I believe you.

1232
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:15,066
Thanks for the roses.
They were beautiful.

1233
01:02:15,149 --> 01:02:17,527
That's all right, Mr. Williams.

1234
01:02:19,362 --> 01:02:21,906
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Don't you even dare. Be quiet.

1235
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:24,075
- I want to get him out of here.
- Are you crazy?

1236
01:02:24,158 --> 01:02:26,285
You wouldn't get halfway down
that hall without being seen.

1237
01:02:26,369 --> 01:02:27,870
- But they'll find him.
- I know it.

1238
01:02:27,954 --> 01:02:29,705
I'm trying to think
before those reporters come back.

1239
01:02:29,789 --> 01:02:31,666
Let 'em take me.
What difference does it make?

1240
01:02:31,749 --> 01:02:33,918
- No, <i>I'll</i> never let 'em.
-(doorknob rattling)

1241
01:02:34,001 --> 01:02:35,586
Hey, who locked the door?

1242
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:37,713
-(pounding)
- It's too late.

1243
01:02:37,797 --> 01:02:40,133
- No, it isn't. Earl, get in this desk.
- What's the use?

1244
01:02:40,216 --> 01:02:42,218
Come on. Get in.

1245
01:02:46,973 --> 01:02:49,725
- Open up!
- Pull yourself together. All right.

1246
01:02:49,809 --> 01:02:51,227
- (crying)
- Sit down.

1247
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:54,313
-(pounding continues)
- All right, all right. I'm coming.

1248
01:02:56,691 --> 01:03:00,486
- Are you tryin' to kick the building down?
- Gettin' exclusive. We got phone calls to -

1249
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:02,613
- What's she doin' up here?
- Get some smelling salts.

1250
01:03:02,697 --> 01:03:05,116
- What's the matter?
- Came up here and had hysterics.

1251
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:07,034
- Looks pretty sick.
- How you feel, kid?

1252
01:03:07,118 --> 01:03:09,078
- I don't feel so good.
- Get you some water?

1253
01:03:09,162 --> 01:03:10,663
- I'll get it.
- Do anything for you?

1254
01:03:10,746 --> 01:03:12,331
- No.
- You don't look sick to me.

1255
01:03:12,415 --> 01:03:14,584
- You didn't bump into Williams, did you?
- Ain't you funny.

1256
01:03:14,667 --> 01:03:16,586
- Yeah? Where is he?
- Let me alone, will ya?

1257
01:03:16,669 --> 01:03:19,005
- Okay. Give me the desk.
- No harm in askin'.

1258
01:03:19,088 --> 01:03:21,090
Hello, Jim? False alarm.

1259
01:03:21,174 --> 01:03:24,802
They surrounded the house, but they forgot
to tell Williams, and he wasn't there.

1260
01:03:24,886 --> 01:03:27,638
Some Halloween going on outside.
The whole police force standing on its ear.

1261
01:03:27,722 --> 01:03:30,308
- Hildy, I thought you were gone.
- Been waitin' for money from Walter.

1262
01:03:30,391 --> 01:03:32,518
What a chase. Give me Emil.

1263
01:03:32,602 --> 01:03:34,520
-(chattering)
- Any news, boys?

1264
01:03:34,604 --> 01:03:37,064
Yeah, I've never been
so tired in my life.

1265
01:03:37,148 --> 01:03:40,902
Where? Melrose Station? All right,
connect me. Hello, Mollie, how are ya?

1266
01:03:40,985 --> 01:03:43,237
- Hey, fellas, this looks good.
- Call you back.

1267
01:03:43,321 --> 01:03:46,532
An old lady just called the detective bureau,
claims Williams is hiding under her piazza.

1268
01:03:46,616 --> 01:03:48,618
- Tell her to stand up.
- We looked every other place.

1269
01:03:48,701 --> 01:03:51,787
- Don't you want to go out on it?
- I have to stick around. I'll cover this end.

1270
01:03:51,871 --> 01:03:54,665
- I spent $1.40 on taxicabs already.
- Let's not do any more goin' out.

1271
01:03:54,749 --> 01:03:57,084
- Never mind, Sarge. Tear it up.
- Who pulled the shades down?

1272
01:03:57,168 --> 01:03:59,003
I did. They were throwing
those lights around.

1273
01:04:03,424 --> 01:04:05,718
N' (whistling)

1274
01:04:05,801 --> 01:04:10,014
You know, I got a hunch Williams ain't
anywhere they been lookin' for him.

1275
01:04:10,097 --> 01:04:12,266
He might be right here
in this building somewhere.

1276
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:15,436
HILDY: Sure, hanging around
like a duck in a shooting gallery.

1277
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,439
There's that skylight to get out of.
But how did he reach the ground?

1278
01:04:18,523 --> 01:04:21,484
- I'm pretending there ain't any Earl Williams.
- He could jump over to this roof.

1279
01:04:21,567 --> 01:04:22,777
It's only about four feet.

1280
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:25,112
Once he got to the roof,
he could slide down a drainpipe.

1281
01:04:25,196 --> 01:04:27,156
And come in any one
of these windows on this side.

1282
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,242
The story's gonna walk
right in the window -

1283
01:04:29,325 --> 01:04:32,495
Masterminds at work. You boys go home.
Maybe Williams will call on you.

1284
01:04:32,578 --> 01:04:34,747
Wouldn't it be funny
if he's in this building?

1285
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:37,124
Why not search the building?
Everybody take a floor.

1286
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:40,461
- I'm not gonna wander all over.
- A great bunch of reporters you are.

1287
01:04:40,545 --> 01:04:43,256
The biggest story in two years,
and you're too lazy to go out.

1288
01:04:43,339 --> 01:04:47,093
If I know you, you seem pretty anxious
to get rid of us. You trying to scoop us?

1289
01:04:47,176 --> 01:04:48,719
Are you crazy? On my own time?

1290
01:04:48,803 --> 01:04:51,013
Maybe Mollie's given her the story
on how Williams got the gun.

1291
01:04:51,097 --> 01:04:53,474
- Did you smuggle that gun in to Williams?
- I didn't do nothin'.

1292
01:04:53,558 --> 01:04:55,893
- Come clean, Mollie.
- HILDY: Let the girl alone.

1293
01:04:55,977 --> 01:04:57,395
Well?

1294
01:04:57,478 --> 01:05:00,356
- Mrs. Baldwin. Mother -
- Don't you “Mother” me.

1295
01:05:00,439 --> 01:05:03,067
Playing cat-and-mouse with my poor boy,
keeping him locked up.

1296
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:05,861
Making us miss two trains, and you
supposed to be married tomorrow.

1297
01:05:05,945 --> 01:05:08,906
<i>- I'll</i> be with you in five minutes.
- You don't have to go at all.

1298
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:11,909
Give me Bruce's money. You can stay
here forever, as far as I'm concerned.

1299
01:05:11,993 --> 01:05:14,745
- You and that murderer you caught.
- What's that? What murderer?

1300
01:05:14,829 --> 01:05:17,623
Which one of these men is it?
They all look like murderers.

1301
01:05:17,707 --> 01:05:20,001
- What murderer did you catch?
- I don't know what she's talking about.

1302
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:22,461
- I never said any such thing.
- I'm quoting my son.

1303
01:05:22,545 --> 01:05:25,131
- And he has never lied to me.
- That's ridiculous.

1304
01:05:25,214 --> 01:05:27,466
- I never said anything like that!
- Yes, you did.

1305
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:32,305
No, I said I was trying to find the murderer.
She's got it all balled up.

1306
01:05:32,388 --> 01:05:35,141
- Who you holdin' out on?
- Nobody. Let me go.

1307
01:05:35,224 --> 01:05:37,977
- I don't know where he is.
- Stop it. Stop it!

1308
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:40,771
What are you askin' her for?
She don't know where he is.

1309
01:05:40,855 --> 01:05:42,481
I'm the only one that knows.

1310
01:05:42,565 --> 01:05:44,191
- Where is Williams?
- Try and find out.

1311
01:05:44,275 --> 01:05:46,861
- Come on, Mollie. Talk.
- Talk? Now you want me to talk?

1312
01:05:46,944 --> 01:05:48,779
- Sure.
- Ain't that funny.

1313
01:05:48,863 --> 01:05:52,450
You wouldn't listen before, not for a minute,
and now you want me to talk.

1314
01:05:52,533 --> 01:05:54,744
- HILDY: Don't tell 'em anything, Mollie.
- I know what I'm doing.

1315
01:05:54,827 --> 01:05:57,288
- Stay out of this, Hildy.
- Why didn't you listen to me?

1316
01:05:57,371 --> 01:05:59,707
- Cut that out!
- Keep your hands off me.

1317
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:02,293
What do you want to know for?
So you can write more lies.

1318
01:06:02,376 --> 01:06:04,587
- So you can sell more papers.
- Never mind that.

1319
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:08,549
All right, I'll give you a story,
a wonderful story!

1320
01:06:08,633 --> 01:06:11,552
Only this time it'll be true!
You'll never find him now!

1321
01:06:11,636 --> 01:06:13,054
-(shouting)
-(screaming)

1322
01:06:13,137 --> 01:06:15,931
Get the ambulance, somebody.
Get an ambulance, somebody.

1323
01:06:20,144 --> 01:06:23,814
- She's dead.
- No, she isn't killed. She's moving!

1324
01:06:27,276 --> 01:06:28,986
- Darling, did you see that?
- Where is he?

1325
01:06:29,070 --> 01:06:30,738
- She jumped out the window.
- Where is he?

1326
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:33,199
- She isn't dead.
- Hildy, where have you got Williams?

1327
01:06:33,282 --> 01:06:36,077
He's in the desk.
Can't believe she didn't kill herself.

1328
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,329
- How you doin'?
- Get me out. I can't stand it.

1329
01:06:38,412 --> 01:06:40,498
- Keep quiet. You're sitting pretty.
- What's in there?

1330
01:06:40,581 --> 01:06:43,501
- Who are you? Who is she?
- This is Mrs. Baldwin, Bruce's mother.

1331
01:06:43,584 --> 01:06:44,960
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!

1332
01:06:45,044 --> 01:06:48,005
- I won't! You're doing something wrong.
- Take her out of here.

1333
01:06:48,089 --> 01:06:50,466
Fine. Louie, take the lady
over to Polack Mike's.

1334
01:06:50,549 --> 01:06:53,511
- My name's Louie Poluso.
-(screaming)

1335
01:06:53,594 --> 01:06:55,721
Knock her out.
See that she doesn't talk to anyone.

1336
01:06:55,805 --> 01:06:57,640
- You can't do this.
- What do I tell 'em?

1337
01:06:57,723 --> 01:07:00,518
- Tell 'em it's a case of dt's.
- Don't worry, Mother. This is only temporary!

1338
01:07:01,268 --> 01:07:04,188
- Walter, let go of me.
- Where do you think you're going?

1339
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:07,024
I'm going after Mother,
and I'm going to get Bruce out of jail.

1340
01:07:07,108 --> 01:07:10,111
- Why did you have to do this to me?
- Get Bruce out of jail?

1341
01:07:10,194 --> 01:07:13,698
How can you worry about a man who's
resting in a nice, quiet police station?

1342
01:07:13,781 --> 01:07:16,909
- This is war. You can't desert me now.
- Get off that trapeze.

1343
01:07:16,992 --> 01:07:19,829
You've got your story in the desk.
Smear it all over the front page.

1344
01:07:19,912 --> 01:07:21,747
“Earl Williams captured
by the Morning <i>Post.”</i>

1345
01:07:21,831 --> 01:07:24,583
I covered your story and got in a mess.
Now I'm gettin' out.

1346
01:07:24,667 --> 01:07:26,961
- You drooling idiot. What do you mean?
- Just what I said.

1347
01:07:27,044 --> 01:07:29,338
There are 365 days in a year
one can get married.

1348
01:07:29,422 --> 01:07:32,508
How many times you got a murderer
locked up in a desk? Once in a lifetime.

1349
01:07:32,591 --> 01:07:35,803
- You got the city by the seat of the pants.
- Sure, I know.

1350
01:07:35,886 --> 01:07:38,723
You've got the brain of a pancake.
This isn't just a story you're covering.

1351
01:07:38,806 --> 01:07:40,015
It's a revolution.

1352
01:07:40,099 --> 01:07:42,935
This is the greatest yarn in journalism
since Livingston discovered Stanley.

1353
01:07:43,018 --> 01:07:46,564
- It's the other way around.
- Don't get technical at a time like this.

1354
01:07:46,647 --> 01:07:50,151
You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden
for 40 years under the same old gang.

1355
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:52,486
With this yarn, you're kicking 'em out,
giving us a chance

1356
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:55,614
to have the kind of government
New York's having under La Guardia.

1357
01:07:55,698 --> 01:07:59,118
If I didn't have your best interest at heart,
you think I'd waste time arguing?

1358
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:01,954
You done something big.
You stepped up into a new class.

1359
01:08:02,037 --> 01:08:03,164
Huh?

1360
01:08:03,247 --> 01:08:07,293
<i>We'll</i> make monkeys out of those ward heelers.
Nobody'll vote for them, not even their wives.

1361
01:08:07,376 --> 01:08:09,378
- Expose 'em, eh?
- We'll crucify that mob.

1362
01:08:09,462 --> 01:08:12,465
We'll keep Williams undercover until morning
so the Post can break the story exclusive.

1363
01:08:12,548 --> 01:08:15,551
- We'll let the governor in on the capture.
- I get it.

1364
01:08:15,634 --> 01:08:17,678
You've kicked over City Hall
like an apple cart.

1365
01:08:17,762 --> 01:08:19,847
You got the mayor and Hartwell
backed up against a wall.

1366
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:21,807
You've put one administration out
and another one in.

1367
01:08:21,891 --> 01:08:24,435
This isn't just a newspaper story,
it's a career.

1368
01:08:24,518 --> 01:08:28,063
And you stand there bellyaching about
whether you catch an 8:00 or 9:00 train.

1369
01:08:28,147 --> 01:08:30,858
- Walter, I never figured it that way.
- You're still a doll-faced hick, that's why.

1370
01:08:30,941 --> 01:08:33,569
- We'd be the white-haired boys.
- They'd be naming streets after you.

1371
01:08:33,652 --> 01:08:37,031
There'll be statues of you in the park.
The movies'll be after you, the radio.

1372
01:08:37,114 --> 01:08:40,075
By tomorrow morning a Hildy Johnson cigar.
I can see the billboards.

1373
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:43,078
-“Light up with Hildy Johnson.”
- Stop that acting. We've got a lot to do.

1374
01:08:43,162 --> 01:08:45,539
- Now you're talking.
- We can't leave Williams in here.

1375
01:08:45,623 --> 01:08:47,750
<i>We'll</i> take him to my private office.
Which is our phone?

1376
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:51,712
- On the end. How you gonna take him?
- We'll carry the desk over.

1377
01:08:51,796 --> 01:08:54,048
You can't move that desk.
It's crawling with cops outside.

1378
01:08:54,131 --> 01:08:57,927
<i>We'll</i> lower it out the window with pulleys.
Get the typewriter. Start pounding out a lead.

1379
01:08:58,010 --> 01:09:01,305
- How much do you want?
- All the words you got. Hello! Give me Duffy.

1380
01:09:01,388 --> 01:09:04,225
- Can I call the mayor a bird of prey?
- Call him anything you like.

1381
01:09:04,308 --> 01:09:06,685
How about the time he had his house
painted by the fire department?

1382
01:09:06,769 --> 01:09:10,064
The works. Hello, Duffy? Get set.
We got the biggest story in years.

1383
01:09:10,147 --> 01:09:12,942
“Earl Williams captured
by The Morning Post, exclusive!

1384
01:09:13,025 --> 01:09:15,444
Yeah! And I want you to tear out
the whole front page.

1385
01:09:15,528 --> 01:09:17,530
I said the whole front page out.

1386
01:09:17,613 --> 01:09:20,366
Never mind the European war.
We got something bigger than that.

1387
01:09:20,449 --> 01:09:23,494
Hildy Johnson's writing the lead.
<i>I'll</i> give it to you as soon as she's finished.

1388
01:09:23,577 --> 01:09:27,122
Get hold of Butch O'Connor. Tell him to
come up with half a dozen of his wrestlers.

1389
01:09:27,206 --> 01:09:29,875
Butch O'Connor.
I've got a desk I want moved.

1390
01:09:29,959 --> 01:09:31,335
- Never mind what -
- Hildy!

1391
01:09:31,418 --> 01:09:33,546
- What the deuce do you want?
- Hello, Bruce.

1392
01:09:33,629 --> 01:09:36,006
Never mind the Chinese earthquake.

1393
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:38,926
- I want to ask one question.
- How did you get out of jail?

1394
01:09:39,009 --> 01:09:41,595
- Not through any help of yours.
- You can't come in here. We're busy.

1395
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:45,808
I'm not talking to you. I had to wire Albany
for $100 so I could get out on bail.

1396
01:09:45,891 --> 01:09:48,602
- I don't care if there's a million dead.
- I don't know what they're gonna think.

1397
01:09:48,686 --> 01:09:51,230
They had to send the money
to the police station.

1398
01:09:51,313 --> 01:09:53,983
- We're waiting for that story.
- We'll explain everything to them, Bruce.

1399
01:09:54,066 --> 01:09:56,110
- Where's Mother? She was coming here.
- She left.

1400
01:09:56,193 --> 01:09:57,903
- I can't hear you, Duffy.
- Where'd she go?

1401
01:09:57,987 --> 01:10:00,322
- Out someplace.
- No, no, junk the Polish corridor.

1402
01:10:00,406 --> 01:10:03,284
- Tell me where my mother was going.
- She couldn't say.

1403
01:10:03,367 --> 01:10:05,786
- This is more important.
- Did she get the money from you?

1404
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:08,414
- No, she left in a hurry.
<i>- I'll</i> take that money.

1405
01:10:08,497 --> 01:10:11,125
- It's right there in my purse.
- I can handle things around here.

1406
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:14,295
- I'll take that certified check too.
- I'll give it to you. Here are the tickets.

1407
01:10:14,378 --> 01:10:17,798
- You'll find your money in the wallet.
- My wallet? This is my wallet!

1408
01:10:17,882 --> 01:10:21,385
Say, there's something funny going on.
What are you doing?

1409
01:10:21,468 --> 01:10:23,554
Just wanted to look at it.

1410
01:10:23,637 --> 01:10:25,973
- Hildy, I'm taking -
- WALTER: What'd you say?

1411
01:10:26,056 --> 01:10:29,059
- Hildy, I'm taking the 9:00 train.
- Sure, sure.

1412
01:10:29,143 --> 01:10:31,770
Did you hear what I said?
I'm taking the 9:00 train.

1413
01:10:31,854 --> 01:10:34,440
The 9:00 train.
Oh, Bruce, I put it in here.

1414
01:10:35,774 --> 01:10:38,444
Hey, let her alone, will you, buddy?

1415
01:10:38,527 --> 01:10:40,988
- Do me a favor, Bruce?
- Just answer me one question.

1416
01:10:41,071 --> 01:10:43,657
- You don't want to come with me, do you?
- I need that!

1417
01:10:43,741 --> 01:10:45,868
- You don't, do you?
- No!

1418
01:10:45,951 --> 01:10:48,370
Take those Miss America pictures
off page six.

1419
01:10:48,454 --> 01:10:49,872
Hildy, tell me the truth.

1420
01:10:49,955 --> 01:10:53,000
- Did you ever love me, Hildy?
- Now look here, my good man!

1421
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:55,586
- You shut up, Burns!
- How can I do anything with this racket?

1422
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:57,087
You're doin' this to her.

1423
01:10:57,171 --> 01:10:59,465
She wanted to get away from you
and everything you stand for,

1424
01:10:59,548 --> 01:11:01,050
but you caught her
and changed her mind.

1425
01:11:01,133 --> 01:11:04,053
Take Hitler and stick him
on the funny page. Let me ask you -

1426
01:11:04,136 --> 01:11:06,555
Are you giving up everything
for a man like him?

1427
01:11:06,639 --> 01:11:09,391
No, I am not, but somethings happened.
I'll tell you everything -

1428
01:11:09,475 --> 01:11:11,560
You'll tell him nothing! He's a spy!

1429
01:11:11,644 --> 01:11:14,772
I am not a spy.
Hildy, you're coming with me now!

1430
01:11:14,855 --> 01:11:17,608
Give me a second.
This is the biggest thing in my life!

1431
01:11:17,691 --> 01:11:20,736
I see. I'll keep.
I'm like something in the icebox.

1432
01:11:20,819 --> 01:11:22,529
- Yeah.
- You don't love me.

1433
01:11:22,613 --> 01:11:25,366
That isn't true. Just because you
won't listen, you say I don't love you.

1434
01:11:25,449 --> 01:11:27,034
That isn't the point at all.

1435
01:11:27,117 --> 01:11:29,828
The point is you never intended
to live like a human being.

1436
01:11:29,912 --> 01:11:32,373
- All right!
- Sebastian jumping!

1437
01:11:32,456 --> 01:11:34,583
- I'm trying to concentrate!
- I see what's going on now.

1438
01:11:34,667 --> 01:11:37,795
- You're just like him and all the rest.
- HILDY: Sure, sure. That's what I am.

1439
01:11:37,878 --> 01:11:41,215
What? No, leave the rooster story alone.
That's human interest.

1440
01:11:41,298 --> 01:11:44,176
- You get hold of Butch O'Connor?
- If you had any sympathy or understanding -

1441
01:11:44,259 --> 01:11:46,220
- I understand, all right.
- Wait.

1442
01:11:46,303 --> 01:11:48,180
There's only one question
I want to know.

1443
01:11:48,263 --> 01:11:50,265
Walter, the mayor's first wife -
What was her name?

1444
01:11:50,349 --> 01:11:53,018
The one with the wart on her? Fanny.
What, Duffy?

1445
01:11:53,102 --> 01:11:55,896
- I don't think you ever loved me at all.
- Never mind that!

1446
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:57,982
You're not working
for the advertising department.

1447
01:11:58,065 --> 01:12:00,567
If you change your mind,
I'm leaving on the 9:00 train.

1448
01:12:00,651 --> 01:12:03,320
If you want me, Bruce,
you gotta take me as I am.

1449
01:12:03,404 --> 01:12:06,156
I'm no suburban bridge player.
I'm a newspaperman.

1450
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:11,078
That's the stuff, Hildy. Keep it coming.
Get back in there, you mock turtle.

1451
01:12:12,621 --> 01:12:16,667
Duffy, did you tell Butch and his gang
to take a taxi as a matter of life and death?

1452
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:20,254
Stay on this wire. Butch is on his way.
We gotta hold out for 15 minutes.

1453
01:12:20,337 --> 01:12:23,340
- The boys'll be coming in here to phone.
<i>- I'll</i> handle 'em.

1454
01:12:24,299 --> 01:12:26,844
Ah, now the moon's out.

1455
01:12:29,513 --> 01:12:31,015
(three knocks)

1456
01:12:31,098 --> 01:12:33,851
Fine, three taps is me.
Don't forget. Got enough air?

1457
01:12:33,934 --> 01:12:37,104
- Not very much.
- That better? You're sitting pretty.

1458
01:12:37,187 --> 01:12:40,274
- How's it coming, honey?
- All right, I guess. Where's Bruce?

1459
01:12:40,357 --> 01:12:42,109
- Oh, he went out.
- Is he coming back?

1460
01:12:42,192 --> 01:12:45,070
Certainly. Didn't you hear him?
What have you got so far?

1461
01:12:45,154 --> 01:12:47,781
“While hundreds of Sheriff Hartwell's
paid gunmen stalked through the city,

1462
01:12:47,865 --> 01:12:50,159
shooting innocent bystanders,
spreading their reign of terror,

1463
01:12:50,242 --> 01:12:53,287
- Earl Williams was lurking less than 20 yards - ”
- Aren't you gonna mention the Post?

1464
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:56,123
- Doesn't the paper get credit?
- I did that in the second paragraph.

1465
01:12:56,206 --> 01:12:57,499
Who's gonna read
the second paragraph?

1466
01:12:57,583 --> 01:13:00,586
For ten years I've been tellin' you how
to write a story, and that's what I get?

1467
01:13:04,548 --> 01:13:06,842
What's the idea of locking this door?

1468
01:13:06,925 --> 01:13:09,178
- Who's that?
- Bensinger. That's his desk.

1469
01:13:09,261 --> 01:13:11,805
- Open the door, will ya?
-(pounding)

1470
01:13:11,889 --> 01:13:14,308
- What'd you say his name was?
- Bensinger, of The Tribune.

1471
01:13:14,391 --> 01:13:17,895
- <i>Tribune,</i> huh?
<i>- Who's in</i> there?

1472
01:13:17,978 --> 01:13:21,690
Haven't you any better sense -
Uh, hello. Hello, Mr. Burns.

1473
01:13:21,774 --> 01:13:23,776
Well, quite an honor
having you come over here.

1474
01:13:23,859 --> 01:13:25,819
- Hello, Bensinger.
- Oh, you know my -

1475
01:13:25,903 --> 01:13:28,197
-(chuckling)
- Excuse me, I just want to get my -

1476
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:31,116
It's quite a coincidence
seeing you tonight. isn't it, Hildy?

1477
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,910
- Yes.
- How do you mean?

1478
01:13:32,993 --> 01:13:35,412
I was talking to our Mr. Duffy
about you this afternoon.

1479
01:13:35,496 --> 01:13:39,249
- Really. Nothing detrimental, I hope.
- On the contrary.

1480
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:42,002
That was one swell story
you had in the paper this morning.

1481
01:13:42,086 --> 01:13:45,631
- Did you care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
- Uh, the poem?

1482
01:13:45,714 --> 01:13:48,550
- The poem was great.
- I like the ending especially.

1483
01:13:48,634 --> 01:13:50,594
“And all is well outside his cell,

1484
01:13:50,677 --> 01:13:54,139
but in his heart, he hears the hangman
calling and the gallows falling

1485
01:13:54,223 --> 01:13:56,850
and his white-haired mother's tears.”

1486
01:13:56,934 --> 01:13:58,435
- Heartbreaking?
- Uh-huh.

1487
01:13:58,519 --> 01:14:00,813
- That's fine. How'd you like to work for me?
- What?

1488
01:14:00,896 --> 01:14:04,691
We can use a man like you. We got
a lot of lowbrows like Johnson here.

1489
01:14:04,775 --> 01:14:07,444
- Are you serious, Mr. Burns?
- Serious? Wait a minute.

1490
01:14:07,528 --> 01:14:10,239
Duffy, I'm sending
a Mr. Bunsinger over to see you.

1491
01:14:10,322 --> 01:14:12,074
- Bensinger.
- Mervyn, isn't it?

1492
01:14:12,157 --> 01:14:14,535
- Yeah. No, Roy. Roy V.
- Certainly.

1493
01:14:14,618 --> 01:14:16,745
Roy V. Bensinger, the poet.

1494
01:14:16,829 --> 01:14:21,166
Of course you wouldn't know. You probably
never heard of Shakespeare either.

1495
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:22,376
(slaps back)

1496
01:14:22,459 --> 01:14:24,878
I want you to put Mr. Bensinger
on the staff right away.

1497
01:14:24,962 --> 01:14:26,922
<i>- How much you getting on The Tribune?
- Ah, 75.</i>

1498
01:14:27,005 --> 01:14:30,217
I'll give you 100 and a byline. You give
him everything he wants, understand?

1499
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,844
Okay. Look.

1500
01:14:31,927 --> 01:14:35,389
I want you to write me a story from
the point of view of the escaped man.

1501
01:14:35,472 --> 01:14:37,933
He hides, cowering,
afraid of every sound, of every light.

1502
01:14:38,016 --> 01:14:40,769
He hears footsteps. His heart
is going like that. They're closing in.

1503
01:14:40,853 --> 01:14:43,814
- Get the sense of the animal at bay.
- Sort of a Jack London style?

1504
01:14:43,897 --> 01:14:45,732
- Exactly.
<i>- I'll</i> get my rhyming dictionary.

1505
01:14:45,816 --> 01:14:47,734
It doesn't have to rhyme.

1506
01:14:47,818 --> 01:14:50,154
- Well, I'm deeply grateful, Mr. Burns.
- Good.

1507
01:14:50,237 --> 01:14:53,866
Oh! If you should have an opening
for a war correspondent,

1508
01:14:53,949 --> 01:14:55,868
I par/er a little French.

1509
01:14:55,951 --> 01:14:58,453
- I'll keep you in mind.
- Au revoir, mon capitaine.

1510
01:14:58,537 --> 01:15:00,038
<i>Bonjour.</i>

1511
01:15:02,833 --> 01:15:04,877
(laughs)
“His white-haired mother's tears."

1512
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,587
That's the stuff, isn't it?

1513
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:10,215
Listen, Bensinger is on his way to see you.
Handle him with kid gloves.

1514
01:15:10,299 --> 01:15:11,925
Put him to work writing poetry.

1515
01:15:12,009 --> 01:15:14,636
No, we don't want him.
Just stall him until the extra's out.

1516
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:17,055
Then tell him his poetry smells
and kick him downstairs.

1517
01:15:17,139 --> 01:15:18,765
Double-crossing swine.

1518
01:15:18,849 --> 01:15:21,643
You said it. He won't quit his paper
without giving notice after this.

1519
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:23,729
I mean you.
You'd double-cross anybody.

1520
01:15:23,812 --> 01:15:25,856
Wait a minute. I just remembered.

1521
01:15:25,939 --> 01:15:28,442
Bruce isn't coming back here.
He's taking the 9:00 train.

1522
01:15:28,525 --> 01:15:30,485
In that case, he's gone.

1523
01:15:30,569 --> 01:15:33,238
Don't sit there like a frozen robin.
Get on with the story.

1524
01:15:33,322 --> 01:15:36,116
We ought to have our plans finished
by the time Butch gets here.

1525
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:39,703
How you have messed up my life.
What am I going to do?

1526
01:15:39,786 --> 01:15:42,122
The window's too small.
We'll have to carry the desk out.

1527
01:15:42,206 --> 01:15:45,626
I oughta be on that train right now.
What a sap I am, falling for your line.

1528
01:15:45,709 --> 01:15:48,212
They're gonna name streets after me.
Johnson Street.

1529
01:15:48,295 --> 01:15:50,339
- Get back to work.
- I'm not going back to work.

1530
01:15:50,422 --> 01:15:52,341
(doorknob rattling)

1531
01:15:52,424 --> 01:15:54,551
- Who is it?
- It's me, boss. It's Louie.

1532
01:15:54,635 --> 01:15:56,678
Louie.

1533
01:15:57,596 --> 01:15:59,765
- Holy smokes! What's the matter with you?
- Where's Mrs. Baldwin?

1534
01:15:59,848 --> 01:16:01,266
- What happened?
- You been in a fight?

1535
01:16:01,350 --> 01:16:03,936
Down Western Avenue,
we was going 65 miles an hour.

1536
01:16:04,019 --> 01:16:06,605
- Take that mush out of your mouth.
- Where's the old lady?

1537
01:16:06,688 --> 01:16:09,399
We run smack into a police patrol,
busted it in half.

1538
01:16:09,483 --> 01:16:11,235
- Was she hurt?
- Where is she?

1539
01:16:11,318 --> 01:16:14,238
Imagine bumping into a load of cops.
They come rolling out like oranges.

1540
01:16:14,321 --> 01:16:15,948
- What did you do with her?
- Search me.

1541
01:16:16,031 --> 01:16:18,033
When I come to,
I was running down 34th Street.

1542
01:16:18,116 --> 01:16:19,326
- You were with her?
- Was I?

1543
01:16:19,409 --> 01:16:21,495
- You were in the taxicab.
- The driver got knocked cold.

1544
01:16:21,578 --> 01:16:25,249
Butterfingers! I give you an old dame to take
somewhere and you hand her over to the cops.

1545
01:16:25,332 --> 01:16:28,877
What do you mean, I handed her?
The cops was on the wrong side of the street.

1546
01:16:28,961 --> 01:16:31,088
She's probably squawking her head off
in a police station.

1547
01:16:31,171 --> 01:16:33,840
I don't think she's squawking much.
You know what I mean?

1548
01:16:33,924 --> 01:16:36,426
- Was she killed?
- Was she? Did you notice?

1549
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:39,554
Me with a gun on the hip and
a kidnapped old lady on my hands.

1550
01:16:39,638 --> 01:16:42,641
I'm gonna stick around asking questions
from cops? You know what I mean?

1551
01:16:42,724 --> 01:16:45,602
Dead. Oh, this is the end.

1552
01:16:45,686 --> 01:16:48,313
<i>L'['S</i> fate, Hildy. What will be Will be.

1553
01:16:48,397 --> 01:16:51,191
What am I gonna say to Bruce?
What can I tell him?

1554
01:16:51,275 --> 01:16:54,111
If he really loves you,
you won't have to tell him anything.

1555
01:16:54,194 --> 01:16:57,614
Would you rather have had the old dame
dragging the whole police force in here?

1556
01:16:57,698 --> 01:16:59,825
I killed her. I'm responsible.

1557
01:16:59,908 --> 01:17:02,244
How can I ever face Bruce again?

1558
01:17:02,327 --> 01:17:03,745
Look at me, Hildy.

1559
01:17:03,829 --> 01:17:05,914
I am looking at you, you murderer.

1560
01:17:05,998 --> 01:17:09,209
If it was my own grandmother,
I'd carry on for the paper.

1561
01:17:09,293 --> 01:17:10,877
Louie, where did it happen?

1562
01:17:10,961 --> 01:17:13,672
- Western and 34th.
- I gotta get out of here.

1563
01:17:13,755 --> 01:17:16,174
We can do more here. Now be calm.

1564
01:17:16,258 --> 01:17:19,136
- Listen -
-(phone ringing)

1565
01:17:19,219 --> 01:17:22,180
- Hello? Hello?
- Maine 4557.

1566
01:17:22,264 --> 01:17:24,558
Who? Well, Butch, where are you?

1567
01:17:24,641 --> 01:17:27,519
- Mission Hospital? Receiving room, please.
- What are you doing there?

1568
01:17:27,602 --> 01:17:28,895
Haven't you even started?

1569
01:17:28,979 --> 01:17:31,231
Was there an old lady brought in
from an auto smashup?

1570
01:17:31,315 --> 01:17:33,650
Oh, for H. Sebastian!
It's a matter of life and death.

1571
01:17:33,734 --> 01:17:35,777
- Nobody?
- I can't hear.

1572
01:17:35,861 --> 01:17:39,406
- Morningside 2469.
- They got who? Speak up. A what?

1573
01:17:39,489 --> 01:17:42,617
- You can't stop for a dame now.
- Community hospital. Receiving room, please.

1574
01:17:42,701 --> 01:17:45,996
I don't care if you've been after her
for six years. Our lives are at stake!

1575
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:48,915
Are you gonna let a woman come between us
after all we've been through?

1576
01:17:48,999 --> 01:17:51,251
- Was an old lady brought in there?
- Butch.

1577
01:17:51,335 --> 01:17:55,130
I'd put my arm in fire for you up to here.
You can't double-cross me!

1578
01:17:55,213 --> 01:17:58,800
- Look around, will you?
- Put her on. <i>I'll</i> talk to her.

1579
01:17:58,884 --> 01:18:02,095
Good evening, madam.
Listen, you ten-cent glamour girl.

1580
01:18:02,179 --> 01:18:05,015
You can't keep Butch away
from his duty. What's that?

1581
01:18:05,098 --> 01:18:08,143
You say that again,
<i>I'll</i> come over and kick you in the teeth!

1582
01:18:08,226 --> 01:18:11,480
Say, what kind of language is that?
Now, look here -

1583
01:18:11,563 --> 01:18:14,399
(whimpers)
She hung up. What did I say?

1584
01:18:15,776 --> 01:18:18,528
Duffy. How do you like that,
mousing around with some big -

1585
01:18:18,612 --> 01:18:20,947
- Duffy!
- Will you shut up? I'm tryin' to hear!

1586
01:18:21,031 --> 01:18:23,825
- That's cooperation. Duffy!
- Nobody?

1587
01:18:23,909 --> 01:18:26,787
Well, where is Duffy? (whines)

1588
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:30,248
Diabetes. I ought to know better
than to hire anybody with a disease.

1589
01:18:30,332 --> 01:18:32,626
- Give me Olympia 218.
- Louie.

1590
01:18:32,709 --> 01:18:34,669
- Yes, boss.
- Louie, it's up to you.

1591
01:18:34,753 --> 01:18:37,255
- Anything you say, boss.
- Beat it out. Get ahold of some guys.

1592
01:18:37,339 --> 01:18:39,508
- Who do you want?
- Anybody with hair on his chest.

1593
01:18:39,591 --> 01:18:42,761
Get 'em anywhere. Offer 'em anything.
We got to get that desk out of here.

1594
01:18:42,844 --> 01:18:45,138
- Is it important?
- Louie, you're the best friend I got.

1595
01:18:45,222 --> 01:18:46,640
I like you too.

1596
01:18:46,723 --> 01:18:49,476
Then don't fail me.
Get enough people to move that desk.

1597
01:18:49,559 --> 01:18:53,480
- You know me, boss. The shirt off my back.
- Okay, don't bump into anything.

1598
01:18:53,563 --> 01:18:56,316
That dumb immigrant will flop on me
as sure as you're born.

1599
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,818
Try again at the hospital.

1600
01:18:57,901 --> 01:19:00,404
If he's not back in five minutes,
we'll carry it out alone.

1601
01:19:00,487 --> 01:19:02,614
- Do anything you want.
- We can start a fire.

1602
01:19:02,697 --> 01:19:05,700
- Have the firemen take it out.
- I don't give a darn what you do.

1603
01:19:05,784 --> 01:19:09,121
- See if we can lift it.
- What? Nobody? Oh, never mind!

1604
01:19:09,204 --> 01:19:10,831
- Are you gonna help me?
- No, I'm not.

1605
01:19:10,914 --> 01:19:13,667
- You want me to strain my back?
- I'm going to find Mrs. Baldwin.

1606
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:16,044
I'm going down to the morgue
and find her.

1607
01:19:16,128 --> 01:19:19,172
- We wanna talk a minute.
- What is this?

1608
01:19:19,256 --> 01:19:21,800
- Get your hands off me!
- Now look here, Johnson.

1609
01:19:21,883 --> 01:19:23,677
- Hey, you!
- You mean me?

1610
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,889
Yes, you. What do you mean
by breaking in here like this, hmm?

1611
01:19:27,973 --> 01:19:31,435
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care
who you are or what paper you're editor of.

1612
01:19:31,518 --> 01:19:33,562
- Let go of me, will you?
- Hang onto her.

1613
01:19:33,645 --> 01:19:36,648
- Something's happened to my mother-in-law.
- May be going out to get Williams.

1614
01:19:36,731 --> 01:19:39,109
- She had the door locked.
- She and Mollie were in here talking.

1615
01:19:39,192 --> 01:19:41,820
I don't know anything,
and there's been an accident.

1616
01:19:41,903 --> 01:19:44,197
Johnson, there's something
very peculiar going on here.

1617
01:19:44,281 --> 01:19:46,741
- Now, see here, Johnson.
- Just a moment, Hartwell.

1618
01:19:46,825 --> 01:19:49,786
If you have any accusations to make,
make them in the proper manner.

1619
01:19:49,870 --> 01:19:52,873
- Otherwise I'll have to ask you to get out.
- You'll ask me to what?

1620
01:19:52,956 --> 01:19:54,791
Get out.

1621
01:19:54,875 --> 01:19:58,044
Oh, you will? Keep that door closed
and don't let anybody in or out.

1622
01:19:58,128 --> 01:20:00,547
- We'll see about this.
- Pinky, give him the third degree.

1623
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:04,176
- Get 'em talkin', you got Williams,
- I'm going to get to the bottom of this.

1624
01:20:04,259 --> 01:20:06,845
- Are you going to talk?
- What do you want me to say?

1625
01:20:06,928 --> 01:20:09,347
- What do you know about Williams?
- What do you know about Williams?

1626
01:20:09,431 --> 01:20:12,058
Now we're getting somewhere -
Take her out of here.

1627
01:20:12,142 --> 01:20:15,395
- I've got ways of making her talk.
- Don't you dare touch me or -

1628
01:20:15,479 --> 01:20:17,189
- She's got a gun!
- Grab it!

1629
01:20:17,272 --> 01:20:20,901
- No, you don't! Walter!
- All right, Burns. <i>I'll</i> take that gun.

1630
01:20:22,277 --> 01:20:25,155
- Where did you get this gun?
- I've got a right to carry a gun.

1631
01:20:25,238 --> 01:20:27,199
- Not this gun.
- I can explain that.

1632
01:20:27,282 --> 01:20:31,161
When Hildy told me she was going
to interview Williams, I gave her a gun.

1633
01:20:31,244 --> 01:20:32,871
That's very interesting.

1634
01:20:32,954 --> 01:20:36,124
This happens to be the gun that Williams
used to shoot his way out with!

1635
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:39,961
- Are you trying to make me out a liar?
- I ought to know my own gun -

1636
01:20:40,045 --> 01:20:43,173
- Oh! So that's where Williams got the gun.
- Hildy got it from Williams.

1637
01:20:43,256 --> 01:20:46,510
- Where is Earl Williams?
- You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartwell.

1638
01:20:46,593 --> 01:20:49,012
<i>I'll</i> give you three minutes
to tell me where he is!

1639
01:20:49,095 --> 01:20:52,182
He went to the hospital to call on Egelhoffer
with a bag of marshmallows.

1640
01:20:52,265 --> 01:20:55,310
Where is he? Ask the mastermind
what he's doing here.

1641
01:20:55,393 --> 01:20:57,479
Speak up.
What do you know about this?

1642
01:20:57,562 --> 01:21:01,942
My dear fellow, the Morning Post does
not obstruct justice or hide criminals.

1643
01:21:02,025 --> 01:21:04,444
- You oughta know that.
- You're under arrest.

1644
01:21:04,528 --> 01:21:06,530
- And you too!
- Who's under arrest?

1645
01:21:06,613 --> 01:21:10,116
Listen, you insignificant,
square-toed, pimple-headed spy!

1646
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,661
- You realize what you're doing?
<i>- I'll</i> show you what I'm doing!

1647
01:21:12,744 --> 01:21:15,038
You're obstructing justice,
and so is the Morning <i>Post!</i>

1648
01:21:15,121 --> 01:21:18,416
- I'm going to see that you're fined $10,000!
- You'll see nothing of the kind.

1649
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,919
I'm going to begin
by impounding the Postie' property.

1650
01:21:21,002 --> 01:21:22,629
- Is this your desk?
- No!

1651
01:21:22,712 --> 01:21:25,757
Yes! What are you afraid of, Hildy?
I dare you to move this desk out!

1652
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,384
- Try it.
- I will!

1653
01:21:27,467 --> 01:21:30,637
You move this desk out,
I'll put you behind bars!

1654
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,347
- He can do it too.
- Is that so?

1655
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:35,433
<i>- I'll</i> see that Roosevelt hears about it.
- Tell him. Come on, boys!

1656
01:21:35,517 --> 01:21:37,394
- Confiscate this desk.
- This is your last chance.

1657
01:21:37,477 --> 01:21:39,688
This is a federal offense,
and you fellas will be accessories.

1658
01:21:39,771 --> 01:21:42,399
- We'll take a chance. Go ahead, boys!
- All right.

1659
01:21:42,482 --> 01:21:44,484
-(pounding on door)
- Open up this door!

1660
01:21:45,735 --> 01:21:48,154
Mother, I am glad to see you.
Are you all right?

1661
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:50,907
That's the man that did it, right there.

1662
01:21:52,867 --> 01:21:56,204
- What's the idea here?
- This lady claims she's been kidnapped.

1663
01:21:56,288 --> 01:21:59,165
- They dragged me down the stairs.
- Just a minute.

1664
01:21:59,249 --> 01:22:02,252
- Did this man have anything to do with it?
- He was in charge of the whole thing!

1665
01:22:02,335 --> 01:22:04,713
- He told them to kidnap me.
- Excuse me, madam.

1666
01:22:04,796 --> 01:22:07,549
- Are you referring to me?
- You know you did.

1667
01:22:07,632 --> 01:22:10,844
- What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, huh?
- Trying to frame me, huh?

1668
01:22:10,927 --> 01:22:13,305
I never saw this woman before
in my life.

1669
01:22:13,388 --> 01:22:17,267
What a thing to say. I was standing here
when that girl jumped out the window.

1670
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:20,395
- Call the mayor! Get him here.
- Look here, madam. Be honest.

1671
01:22:20,478 --> 01:22:23,607
If you were joyriding, plastered,
or got into some scrape,

1672
01:22:23,690 --> 01:22:26,443
why don't you admit it
instead of accusing innocent people?

1673
01:22:26,526 --> 01:22:29,446
You ruffian!
How dare you talk like that to me!

1674
01:22:29,529 --> 01:22:31,990
- He's just crazy, Mother.
- I can tell you something more.

1675
01:22:32,073 --> 01:22:34,034
I can tell you why they did it.

1676
01:22:34,117 --> 01:22:37,704
They had a murderer in here,
and they were hiding him!

1677
01:22:37,787 --> 01:22:42,500
- In here?
- You're a cockeyed liar, and you know it!

1678
01:22:42,584 --> 01:22:44,794
-(knocks three times)
- What was that?

1679
01:22:44,878 --> 01:22:46,296
- He's in there.
- Give me the desk.

1680
01:22:46,379 --> 01:22:49,883
- Give me the phone. What a break.
- Stand back, everybody. Get your guns out.

1681
01:22:49,966 --> 01:22:52,218
- He's harmless.
- Shoot right through the desk.

1682
01:22:52,302 --> 01:22:53,928
He can't hurt anybody.
You've got his gun.

1683
01:22:54,012 --> 01:22:55,972
- Oh, dear!
- Go on, you gray-haired old weasel!

1684
01:22:56,056 --> 01:22:57,724
Let me out of here!

1685
01:22:57,807 --> 01:23:00,310
Mother!
I've been looking all over for you.

1686
01:23:00,393 --> 01:23:02,103
- What's happened?
- Hello, Jake? Hang on.

1687
01:23:02,187 --> 01:23:04,022
- Hildy, call Duffy!
- No, you don't!

1688
01:23:04,105 --> 01:23:06,983
- You want to see us scooped?
- Everybody, aim right at the center.

1689
01:23:07,067 --> 01:23:10,236
- That's murder.
- One of you get on each end of the desk.

1690
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,738
- Comin' up.
- We got you covered, Williams!

1691
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:13,865
- Have it in a minute.
- Don't try to move. - Anytime now.

1692
01:23:13,948 --> 01:23:15,659
<i>- I'll</i> count three.
- It's hot!

1693
01:23:15,742 --> 01:23:17,202
- Ready for an emergency.
- One. Two.

1694
01:23:17,285 --> 01:23:18,536
- Any second now.
- Three! Up with it!

1695
01:23:19,162 --> 01:23:22,165
- I got you, Williams!
- Go ahead, shoot me.

1696
01:23:22,248 --> 01:23:25,543
Earl Williams just captured in the press room
in the criminal courts building hiding in a desk.

1697
01:23:25,627 --> 01:23:28,546
- On your feet.
- Don't try any funny stuff.

1698
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:30,090
Williams was unconscious
when they opened the desk.

1699
01:23:30,173 --> 01:23:32,634
Williams put up a struggle,
but the police overpowered him.

1700
01:23:32,717 --> 01:23:34,636
He tried to shoot it out,
but his gun wouldn't work.

1701
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:36,096
Tried to break through
a cordon of police.

1702
01:23:36,179 --> 01:23:38,473
Duffy, the Post just turned Williams
over to the sheriff!

1703
01:23:38,556 --> 01:23:40,100
- Put the cuffs on these people.
- More later.

1704
01:23:40,183 --> 01:23:43,645
An anonymous note
led to Williams' capture. Hold on!

1705
01:23:44,479 --> 01:23:47,565
The sheriff was tracing a telephone call
which gave away Williams' hiding place.

1706
01:23:47,649 --> 01:23:49,275
- Where's the old lady?
- She went out!

1707
01:23:49,359 --> 01:23:51,653
- Out?
- Call me back. I'll call you back!

1708
01:23:56,783 --> 01:23:59,619
N' (humming)

1709
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:02,330
Give me the warden's office, quick.

1710
01:24:02,414 --> 01:24:04,332
Hartwell, you're gonna wish
you'd never been born!

1711
01:24:04,416 --> 01:24:05,667
Oh, am I?

1712
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:08,128
- Hello, Fred.
- Well, fine work, Pete.

1713
01:24:08,211 --> 01:24:10,255
You certainly delivered the goods.
I'm proud of you.

1714
01:24:10,338 --> 01:24:12,006
- Look natural, don't they?
- A sight for sore eyes.

1715
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:14,509
Aiding an escaped criminal
and a little charge of kidnapping.

1716
01:24:14,592 --> 01:24:17,303
What's that? That's the jail.
There must be somebody there.

1717
01:24:17,387 --> 01:24:19,848
Looks like about 10 years apiece
for you two birds.

1718
01:24:19,931 --> 01:24:20,932
Does it?

1719
01:24:21,015 --> 01:24:22,892
Whenever you think you've got
the Morning Post licked,

1720
01:24:22,976 --> 01:24:24,644
it's time for you to get out of town.

1721
01:24:24,728 --> 01:24:27,105
Whistling in the dark. That ain't gonna
help you this time. You're through.

1722
01:24:27,188 --> 01:24:30,650
The last man who said that was Archie Leach,
just a week before he cut his throat.

1723
01:24:30,734 --> 01:24:31,735
Is that so?

1724
01:24:31,818 --> 01:24:33,695
We've been in worse jams than this,
haven't we, Hildy?

1725
01:24:33,778 --> 01:24:34,904
No.

1726
01:24:34,988 --> 01:24:37,782
You forget the power that always
watches over the Morning Post.

1727
01:24:37,866 --> 01:24:40,160
- Your luck's not with you now.
- This is Hartwell.

1728
01:24:40,243 --> 01:24:42,454
I've caught him. Yes, Williams.

1729
01:24:42,537 --> 01:24:45,123
Single-handed. <i>We'll</i> proceed
with the hanging per schedule.

1730
01:24:45,206 --> 01:24:47,292
You're gonna be in office
exactly two days more.

1731
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:49,669
Then we're gonna pull your nose out
of that feed bag.

1732
01:24:49,753 --> 01:24:51,588
- I'll tell you what you'll be doing.
- What?

1733
01:24:51,671 --> 01:24:54,132
- Well, go on.
- Making brooms in the state penitentiary!

1734
01:24:54,215 --> 01:24:57,302
Joe, this is Hartwell.
Come over to my office right away.

1735
01:24:57,385 --> 01:25:00,472
I captured a couple of important birds.
I want you to take their confessions.

1736
01:25:00,555 --> 01:25:01,973
Duffy, get Liebowitz!

1737
01:25:02,056 --> 01:25:04,309
All the lawyers in the world
aren't gonna help you now.

1738
01:25:04,392 --> 01:25:06,227
You're talking to the Morning <i>Post!</i>

1739
01:25:06,311 --> 01:25:08,688
MAYOR:
Oh, power of the press. (laughing)

1740
01:25:08,772 --> 01:25:11,983
WALTER: Bigger men than you have
found out what the power of the press is!

1741
01:25:12,066 --> 01:25:14,319
- Presidents. Kings!
- Here's the reprieve.

1742
01:25:14,402 --> 01:25:17,405
- Say, you - Get out of here.
- You can't bribe me. My wife -

1743
01:25:17,489 --> 01:25:20,909
- Get out of here!
- Oh, no, I won't! Here's the reprieve.

1744
01:25:20,992 --> 01:25:23,328
- What?
- I don't want to be a city sealer.

1745
01:25:23,411 --> 01:25:25,163
- Who is this man?
- Throw him out.

1746
01:25:25,246 --> 01:25:27,707
Just a minute.
Who's trying to bribe you?

1747
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:29,626
- They wouldn't take this.
- He's insane.

1748
01:25:29,709 --> 01:25:31,628
What did I tell ya? An unseen power!

1749
01:25:31,711 --> 01:25:34,297
What do you mean by coming here
with a cock-and-bull story like that?

1750
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:36,424
- SHERIFF: He's an impostor!
- Arrest him.

1751
01:25:36,508 --> 01:25:38,927
Trying to hang an innocent man
to win an election.

1752
01:25:39,010 --> 01:25:40,804
- That's murder.
- Never saw him before.

1753
01:25:40,887 --> 01:25:43,139
- If I was to tell my wife -
- What's your name?

1754
01:25:43,223 --> 01:25:45,809
- Joe Pettibone.
- When did you deliver this first?

1755
01:25:45,892 --> 01:25:47,894
- Who'd you talk to?
- They started right in bribing me.

1756
01:25:47,977 --> 01:25:49,729
- Who's they?
- Those. Them.

1757
01:25:49,813 --> 01:25:52,482
That's absurd! He's talking like a child.

1758
01:25:52,565 --> 01:25:54,859
- Out of the mouths of babes!
- Hi, babe.

1759
01:25:54,943 --> 01:25:56,694
He's insane. Drunk.

1760
01:25:56,778 --> 01:26:00,365
If this unfortunate man has really
been reprieved, I'm tickled to death.

1761
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:03,159
- Aren't you, Pete?
- You'd hang your own mother to be reelected.

1762
01:26:03,243 --> 01:26:06,287
- That's a horrible thing to say about anybody.
- Oh, you're marvelous.

1763
01:26:06,371 --> 01:26:10,250
- Look here, Walter. You're an intelligent man.
- Never mind that.

1764
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:12,502
Now let's have your story,
Mr. Pettibone.

1765
01:26:12,585 --> 01:26:15,296
- Nineteen years ago, I married Mrs. Pettibone.
- Skip all that.

1766
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:18,383
- Only she wasn't Mrs. Pettibone then.
- I mean -

1767
01:26:18,466 --> 01:26:22,136
Sheriff, this document is authentic.
Earl Williams has been reprieved.

1768
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:25,890
And our commonwealth has been saved
the painful necessity of shedding blood.

1769
01:26:25,974 --> 01:26:28,935
You said it. Get off the soapbox.
Save that for the Tribune.

1770
01:26:29,018 --> 01:26:31,229
Pete, take those handcuffs
off my friends.

1771
01:26:31,312 --> 01:26:34,148
- I'm amazed at you, doing a thing like that.
-Isn't he awful?

1772
01:26:34,232 --> 01:26:36,067
- You don't know how badly I feel.
- No.

1773
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:39,696
- No excuse for Pete to fly off the handle.
- I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal.

1774
01:26:39,779 --> 01:26:41,698
- That's all right.
- What'd you say your name was?

1775
01:26:41,781 --> 01:26:44,659
Pettibone. Here's a picture of my wife.

1776
01:26:44,742 --> 01:26:46,870
- A fine-looking woman.
- You haven't seen her yet.

1777
01:26:46,953 --> 01:26:48,580
She's all right.

1778
01:26:48,663 --> 01:26:51,666
She's good enough for me! If I was
to tell my wife - Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1779
01:26:51,749 --> 01:26:54,335
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pettibone.
As long as I'm mayor-

1780
01:26:54,419 --> 01:26:56,421
Which ought to be
about three more hours.

1781
01:26:56,504 --> 01:26:59,591
Just long enough for us to get our
special edition, asking for your recall.

1782
01:26:59,674 --> 01:27:03,136
And your arrest. You boys ought
to get about 10 years apiece.

1783
01:27:03,219 --> 01:27:05,555
Don't make any hasty decisions,
Mr. Burns.

1784
01:27:05,638 --> 01:27:07,599
You might run into a big libel suit!

1785
01:27:07,682 --> 01:27:09,517
You're going to run into the governor.

1786
01:27:09,601 --> 01:27:12,520
My old friend, the governor, and I
understand each other perfectly.

1787
01:27:12,604 --> 01:27:15,565
- Yes, and so do I.
- So do you what, you hoodoo?

1788
01:27:15,648 --> 01:27:18,943
Mr. Pettibone, if you'll come with us,
we'll take you to the warden's office

1789
01:27:19,027 --> 01:27:20,320
and deliver this reprieve.

1790
01:27:20,403 --> 01:27:22,488
- Come along, Pete.
- If I was to tell my wife -

1791
01:27:22,572 --> 01:27:25,658
- You won't have to.
- PETTIBONE: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1792
01:27:25,742 --> 01:27:27,994
Wait till those two future jailbirds
read the Morning Post tomorrow.

1793
01:27:28,077 --> 01:27:29,871
- A tight squeeze though.
- Give me Duffy.

1794
01:27:29,954 --> 01:27:32,290
That's the worst jam
we've been in in a long time.

1795
01:27:32,373 --> 01:27:33,499
Where is he? Get him.

1796
01:27:33,583 --> 01:27:37,420
Remember the time we stole old lady
Haggerty's stomach off the coroner's physician?

1797
01:27:37,503 --> 01:27:41,758
- Anytime you need this guy, he's never there.
- We proved she'd been poisoned.

1798
01:27:41,841 --> 01:27:45,053
We had to hide out for a week.
Remember that?

1799
01:27:45,136 --> 01:27:48,348
The Shoreland Hotel.
That's where - I mean, how we -

1800
01:27:48,431 --> 01:27:51,184
We could've gone to jail for that too.
You know that.

1801
01:27:51,267 --> 01:27:53,853
Yes, you're right, Hildy.
It's a bad business.

1802
01:27:53,937 --> 01:27:57,023
You're gonna be better off.
You'd better get going.

1803
01:27:57,106 --> 01:27:59,817
- Where would I go?
- To Bruce, of course.

1804
01:27:59,901 --> 01:28:02,278
But you know he's gone.
He took the 9:00 train.

1805
01:28:02,362 --> 01:28:05,657
Send him a wire. <i>He'll</i> be waiting
in the station when you get into Albany.

1806
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:09,661
- Why doesn't that guy have a phone in there?
- I got it so messed up.

1807
01:28:09,744 --> 01:28:13,289
- Get going, Hildy.
-“Get going”? What is that with you?

1808
01:28:13,373 --> 01:28:16,250
Wait a minute. Can't you understand?

1809
01:28:16,334 --> 01:28:20,171
I'm trying to do something noble
for once in my life. Get out of here.

1810
01:28:20,254 --> 01:28:22,382
Walter, just a minute.

1811
01:28:22,465 --> 01:28:25,468
- Send the fellow a wire. <i>He'll</i> be waiting.
- Who'll write the story?

1812
01:28:25,551 --> 01:28:28,429
I'll do it myself.
Won't be half as good as you can do it.

1813
01:28:28,513 --> 01:28:30,473
It's my story. I'd like to think -

1814
01:28:30,556 --> 01:28:33,601
- Oh, at last!
- I get it, Walter. The same old act.

1815
01:28:33,685 --> 01:28:36,771
Trying to push me out, thinking
I'll be stupid enough to want to stay.

1816
01:28:36,854 --> 01:28:39,273
I know I deserved that.
Wait a minute, Duffy.

1817
01:28:39,357 --> 01:28:40,984
But this is one time you're wrong.

1818
01:28:41,067 --> 01:28:44,529
Honey, when you walk out that door,
part of me will go with you.

1819
01:28:44,612 --> 01:28:46,948
But a whole new world's
gonna open up for you.

1820
01:28:47,031 --> 01:28:50,201
- I made fun of Bruce. You know why?
- Why?

1821
01:28:50,284 --> 01:28:51,703
I was jealous.

1822
01:28:51,786 --> 01:28:55,540
I was sore because he could offer you
the kind of life I can't give you.

1823
01:28:55,623 --> 01:28:57,125
That's what you want, honey.

1824
01:28:57,208 --> 01:29:00,044
I could stay and do the story
and take the train in the morning.

1825
01:29:00,128 --> 01:29:01,963
No, forget it. Come on, come on.

1826
01:29:02,046 --> 01:29:04,048
Good-bye, dear, and good luck.

1827
01:29:07,969 --> 01:29:10,304
Duffy. This is how it goes so far.

1828
01:29:10,388 --> 01:29:13,224
-(phone ringing)
- Oh, just a minute.

1829
01:29:14,017 --> 01:29:16,477
Hello. Who? Hildy Johnson?

1830
01:29:16,561 --> 01:29:19,355
- No, she just left.
- I'm still here. I can take it.

1831
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:21,315
Hang on a minute.

1832
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:25,445
Hildy Johnson speaking.

1833
01:29:25,528 --> 01:29:28,072
The Fourth Precinct Police Station?

1834
01:29:28,156 --> 01:29:30,158
Well, put him on.

1835
01:29:30,241 --> 01:29:32,827
Bruce, I thought you were
on your way to Albany.

1836
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:36,164
- What for?
- For having counterfeit money.

1837
01:29:36,247 --> 01:29:39,417
- Counterfeit money?
-(clears throat) Hold on a minute, Duffy.

1838
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:41,294
Where did you get it?

1839
01:29:41,377 --> 01:29:43,379
I gave it to you?

1840
01:29:43,463 --> 01:29:47,216
Oh, all right.
I'll try and do something about it.

1841
01:29:48,259 --> 01:29:49,761
(crying)

1842
01:29:53,681 --> 01:29:55,683
(sobbing)

1843
01:29:58,227 --> 01:30:00,146
Oh, honey.

1844
01:30:00,229 --> 01:30:02,273
Honey, don't - don't cry, please.

1845
01:30:02,356 --> 01:30:05,193
Come on. I didn't mean to make you cry.
What's the matter with you?

1846
01:30:05,276 --> 01:30:07,737
You never cried before. Hildy.

1847
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:11,324
I thought you were really
sending me away with Bruce.

1848
01:30:13,326 --> 01:30:16,162
I didn't know you had him locked up.

1849
01:30:16,245 --> 01:30:19,665
I thought...
you were on the level for once,

1850
01:30:19,749 --> 01:30:23,294
that you were just standing by
and letting me go off with him

1851
01:30:23,377 --> 01:30:25,713
and not doing a thing about it.

1852
01:30:25,797 --> 01:30:28,508
Aw, come on, honey.
What do you think I was, a chump?

1853
01:30:28,591 --> 01:30:31,010
And I thought you didn't love me.

1854
01:30:31,094 --> 01:30:34,180
- What were you thinking with?
- I don't know.

1855
01:30:35,056 --> 01:30:37,642
Well, what are you standing there
gawking for?

1856
01:30:37,725 --> 01:30:40,186
We have to get him out of jail.

1857
01:30:40,269 --> 01:30:42,814
Send Louie down
with some honest money

1858
01:30:42,897 --> 01:30:44,982
and send him back to Albany
where he belongs.

1859
01:30:45,066 --> 01:30:46,776
Sure, sure.

1860
01:30:46,859 --> 01:30:50,321
Duffy, everything's changed. Tell Louie
to stand by. We're coming to the office.

1861
01:30:50,404 --> 01:30:52,990
Don't worry about the story.
Hildy's gonna write it.

1862
01:30:53,074 --> 01:30:55,868
Of course she's not quitting.
We're gonna get married.

1863
01:30:55,952 --> 01:30:59,330
- Oh! Can we go on a honeymoon this time?
- Sure.

1864
01:30:59,413 --> 01:31:03,459
Duffy, you can be managing editor.
No, no, not permanently.

1865
01:31:03,543 --> 01:31:05,837
Just for the two weeks
we're away on our honeymoon.

1866
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,214
- What?
- I don't know where. Where are we going?

1867
01:31:08,297 --> 01:31:10,758
- Niagara Falls.
- Niagara Falls, Duffy!

1868
01:31:10,842 --> 01:31:13,427
- Two whole weeks, Walter?
- Sure. You've earned it!

1869
01:31:13,511 --> 01:31:15,638
What? What?

1870
01:31:15,721 --> 01:31:18,224
Strike? What strike?

1871
01:31:18,307 --> 01:31:20,768
Where? Albany?

1872
01:31:20,852 --> 01:31:24,480
- I know it's on the way, but I can't ask Hildy -
- We'll honeymoon in Albany.

1873
01:31:24,564 --> 01:31:26,566
Okay, Duffy. (weak laugh)

1874
01:31:26,649 --> 01:31:30,153
isn't that a coincidence? We're going to Albany.
I wonder if Bruce can put us up.

1875
01:31:30,236 --> 01:31:32,613
Say, why don't you
carry that in your hand?
