2
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,533
(buzzing)

3
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:09,267
(buzzing)

4
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:13,933
(buzzing
continues)

5
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:16,167
(liquid pouring)

6
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,700
(with thick German accent)
Tonight, my dear Maxwell.

7
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,833
I'm ready to try
my experiment on a human.

8
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,067
Yes?

9
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:42,133
In the morgue, there is
a lethal gassed suicide.

10
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:44,733
An ideal specimen.

11
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:47,233
(screwdriver clatters)

12
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,500
Have you made
arrangements?

13
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,333
No.

14
00:02:56,333 --> 00:03:01,367
You know I do not work
under prying eyes.

15
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,667
You will find a way for me
to work without detection.

16
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:10,733
It is your chance
to show me your gratitude

17
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:14,567
for my generosity
and protection.

18
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,100
I will never forget
what you have done for me

19
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,933
and will do anything
to help you,

20
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:29,067
but the morgue--
dead people!

21
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:31,100
Suppose we should
be caught?

22
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:41,433
How many times have you told me
of your impersonations?

23
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,400
That you never
had a chance?

24
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,200
Maybe your art
will serve you after all.

25
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,200
You have seen
the coroner?

26
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,233
Why not impersonate him?
No!

27
00:03:57,233 --> 00:03:58,433
That's it!
No!

28
00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:01,167
Impersonate him!

29
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:05,400
The time has come
when you can repay me

30
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,833
for what
I have done.

31
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,533
It's horrible,
I tell you!

32
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:11,200
Working
on the dead.

33
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,867
Trying to
bring back life!

34
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:14,600
It's not natural!

35
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,567
You with
your weird ideas.

36
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:20,367
Haven't I stood here
and nursed dying dogs?

37
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:21,367
Yeah.

38
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:23,233
And even
that miserable cat?

39
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:25,167
(hissing)

40
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:27,300
And for what?

41
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,300
For a measly roof
and food.

42
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,733
Because you
took me in

43
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:34,533
when I was
down and out.

44
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:39,867
Once a ham,
always a ham.

45
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:46,867
You,
an actor?

46
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:48,533
(scoffing)

47
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,067
But don't forget,
my dear Maxwell,

48
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:58,700
the police would be
very glad to find you.

49
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:02,067
I didn't mean
I wouldn't.

50
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:06,100
Of course not.

51
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,367
In time,

52
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:11,933
you may become
a great man.

53
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:02,067
This is the one--
here!

54
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:13,167
File number 26941.

55
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:17,567
Maria Alchura, 24,
suicide.

56
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:19,433
Carbon monoxide gas.

57
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:20,900
Not claimed.

58
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,533
Perfect.

59
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:58,233
But we'll have
to work fast.

60
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:08,633
Phew!

61
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,067
My gosh.

62
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:15,667
Them stiffs is gettin' heavier
and more of them every day.

63
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:26,433
Between the gangsters
and the auto drivers,

64
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:28,900
we don't need another war
to carry off the population.

65
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,633
You didn't even
mention suicides.

66
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:36,067
They even got the coroner
working overtime.

67
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:48,167
Say, did you see the beaut
that come in today?

68
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,900
Did I?

69
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,800
She's the one that has the
coroner doing the night work.

70
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:07,500
What,
special autopsy?

71
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,867
Must be.

72
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:24,567
I wonder who that old
Santy Claus is!
(laughing)

73
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,333
I must get her
out of here.

74
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,433
She must
have oxygen.

75
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,267
Unlock
the side door.

76
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:42,833
And back up
the cart.

77
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,933
But watch out
for the guard

78
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:47,333
and as soon as
he's out of the way,

79
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,467
we'll take her
out of here.

80
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:04,067
You say the corpse of
a young woman has been stolen?

81
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:05,233
Yes.

82
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:07,400
And it sure
has me puzzled.

83
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,467
Why, Mike thought
 I took it.

84
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:12,733
I'd have swore it was
the coroner himself.

85
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:20,767
There must have been
a very strong resemblance.

86
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:24,633
Yeah, he was the dead image
of him and talked like him too.

87
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:26,300
Oh, you talked
to him.

88
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,633
No.

89
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,700
No, he was talking to
some other old fellow there

90
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,133
that looked like Santy Claus,
as I said to Jake.

91
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:37,633
He had whiskers and bushy hair
and his eyes was wild.

92
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:41,067
Must have been
some other two fellas.

93
00:09:41,067 --> 00:09:44,500
Could you possibly identify
if you saw the party?

94
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,533
I wouldn't swear
to anything now,

95
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:49,933
after being so sure
of the coroner.

96
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:51,600
You know,
Mike's description

97
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,767
is very much like
your friend Meirschultz.

98
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:56,800
Tell me,

99
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,667
have you seen him
of late?

100
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:03,433
Why, Dr. Meirschultz is really
a great research scientist.

101
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,733
Why, he's formulated
some amazing methods

102
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:10,833
for preserving gland extracts
in the most potent state.

103
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,667
He's no
body snatcher.

104
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:16,000
Well, doctors
and scientists

105
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
often have some queer things
in their minds.

106
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,733
Anyway, uh,
I'll look into it.

107
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:23,233
Go easy,
Jones.

108
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:26,267
I wouldn't like
to offend the doctor.

109
00:10:26,267 --> 00:10:27,400
Don't worry.

110
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,133
I'll do nothing
to embarrass you.

111
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:31,500
Thank you.

112
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:39,400
Captain?

113
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,600
What do I do
about this?

114
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:48,200
Collins.

115
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,933
See if you have anything there
on Don Maxwell.

116
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:55,400
Last heard from
in this city.

117
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,900
Uh, impersonations,
vaudeville.

118
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,833
Yeah.

119
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,067
Okay, Cap.

120
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:06,533
Let's see what we got
in our files on Don Maxwell.

121
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:15,200
With 24 hours complete rest,
she will recover.

122
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:33,867
Think of it.

123
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:38,700
Life, back in the body
that sought oblivion.

124
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,533
It's uncanny.

125
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,467
The possibilities
terrify me.

126
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:54,067
But not
one word out.

127
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,567
This is
but a step.

128
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:04,133
Cases like this
has the element of doubt.

129
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:08,367
What I want is a victim
with a shattered heart!

130
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:11,433
Yes, a heart!

131
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,933
That I can replace
with this beating thing

132
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:20,967
I have forced life
back into!

133
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:23,900
(laughs wildly)

134
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:28,333
You will get me
such a victim, Maxwell!

135
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:33,367
It will be my supreme
accomplishment!

136
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:35,600
(laughs wildly)

137
00:12:40,267 --> 00:12:42,200
Not from
the morgue!

138
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,600
They'll get
suspicious.

139
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,067
I don't care
where you get it.

140
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:49,667
From the morgue, from
the streets, the undertaker.

141
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:50,700
(thud)

142
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,300
Get one!

143
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:57,833
The end will justify
the means.

144
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,133
The undertaker
around the corner.

145
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:10,433
That gangster
shot today!

146
00:13:10,433 --> 00:13:12,933
Just the thing.

147
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:14,333
(door closes)

148
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:37,200
(cats hissing,
screeching)

149
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:48,733
(cats hissing
and screeching)

150
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:53,467
(hissing,
screeching)

151
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,100
(snarling,
growling)

152
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:24,833
Where is it?

153
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,433
I couldn't get it.

154
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,400
(panting)

155
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:33,533
Coward!

156
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:36,200
(sobbing)

157
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:40,733
Oh, you fool!

158
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:43,067
You have failed me

159
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:46,700
in the greatest moment
of my life!

160
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,900
(shouts angrily)

161
00:14:52,633 --> 00:14:53,567
Argh!

162
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:59,833
(continues sobbing)

163
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,267
(laughing wildly)

164
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:23,933
(crashing,
glass and metal rattling)

165
00:15:28,967 --> 00:15:31,333
I have it!

166
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,200
You know
my powers.

167
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,100
You have worked
with me.

168
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,700
You have faith in me.

169
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,733
Here,
take this.

170
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:41,933
Take it
and take your life

171
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:44,233
and I will give it
back to you.

172
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:47,067
My living beating heart
shall beat in your body

173
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:48,933
and will live
again.

174
00:15:48,933 --> 00:15:50,867
Only think of it.

175
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:55,167
You will live!
(laughing wildly)

176
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:59,433
You will live!
(laughing wildly)

177
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:01,200
Live!

178
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,433
(gun firing)

179
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:18,567
**

180
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,167
Murder.

181
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:00,933
(disgusted)
Oh.

182
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:05,767
Murderer.

183
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:09,633
And of my benefactor!

184
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:12,800
Horrible.

185
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,600
He had so much
to give the world.

186
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:23,733
But has he?

187
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:31,533
Why should the unconscious peace
of the dead be disturbed?

188
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:36,433
Isn't the spark
that moves the maggot

189
00:17:36,433 --> 00:17:40,133
the selfsame spark
that moves the man?

190
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:43,800
Preserving that spark in the
individual is not important.

191
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:48,067
What we do with the spark
while we have it is important!

192
00:17:50,867 --> 00:17:53,867
In Meirschultz,
the spark is gone.

193
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,333
In Maxwell,
it lives.

194
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:30,233
This may
come in handy.

195
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:32,067
Nothing
can bring him back.

196
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:35,967
I'd better
hide him.

197
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:38,833
(doorbell buzzing)

198
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:10,567
Dr. Meirschultz,
please.

199
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,500
Why,
he isn't here.

200
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,833
How terrible!

201
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,333
It's so
very urgent!

202
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,067
Will you tell him
that Mr. Buckley is having

203
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:21,933
positively alarming
hallucinations.

204
00:19:21,933 --> 00:19:24,633
Why, he thinks he's
the orangutan murderer

205
00:19:24,633 --> 00:19:27,167
in Poe's "Murder
of the Rue Morgue".

206
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,967
Tell the doctor
I must have some definite help.

207
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:34,233
I'll go get him
and bring him in.

208
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,067
No, don't do that.

209
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:11,767
Meirschultz
would be missed.

210
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:14,467
Maxwell never would.

211
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,167
You're clean.

212
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:43,133
Not only do I look
like Meirschultz,

213
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:45,867
I am Meirschultz!

214
00:21:45,867 --> 00:21:49,067
I will be
a great man!

215
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,567
**

216
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,567
I'll give him a shot
to relieve the nerve tension.

217
00:22:41,567 --> 00:22:42,900
It may help him.

218
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,567
We'll try that
first.

219
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:46,167
Take off
your coat.

220
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,400
Super adrenaline.

221
00:23:36,967 --> 00:23:38,600
No,
not that.

222
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:45,200
Ah!

223
00:23:48,733 --> 00:23:50,900
Water.

224
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,967
That will
do no harm.

225
00:23:59,067 --> 00:24:01,100
And I will be
rid of them.

226
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:27,367
(gasping)

227
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
There now.

228
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,200
You'll feel better.

229
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,733
(grunting)

230
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:42,200
Will it make--

231
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:46,633
Doctor!

232
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:49,167
He seems to be getting worse
instead of better.

233
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:56,933
(groaning)

234
00:24:58,367 --> 00:25:02,467
Stealing through
my body.

235
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:05,100
Creeping
through my veins.

236
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,867
Pouring in my blood!

237
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:13,667
Douse the fire
in my brain!

238
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,700
Stabbing me.

239
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Agony!

240
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:23,467
I can't stand
this torture!

241
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:26,200
This torment!

242
00:25:27,267 --> 00:25:29,633
(screaming)
I can't stand it!

243
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:31,300
I won't!

244
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,700
I won't!

245
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,067
I won't--
(groaning, snarling)

246
00:25:43,067 --> 00:25:45,367
(snarling,
groaning)

247
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:47,067
(screeching)

248
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:49,667
What was
in that hypo?

249
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:55,100
(growling)

250
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:06,533
(growling)

251
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:08,600
(screaming)

252
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,367
(snarling, growling)

253
00:26:21,067 --> 00:26:22,367
(table thudding)

254
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:28,167
(snarling continues)

255
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:33,433
(Mrs. Buckley screams)

256
00:26:35,167 --> 00:26:36,567
He's dead!

257
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:37,700
Doctor!

258
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,733
What have you done?

259
00:26:39,733 --> 00:26:41,533
This looks
like murder.

260
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:44,167
No, no,
not murder.

261
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:49,433
My assistant
shot himself.

262
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,700
Shot himself?

263
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,533
When?

264
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:58,633
Why, I only saw him
an hour ago.

265
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:01,233
Why didn't you call
the police?

266
00:27:01,233 --> 00:27:03,767
No,
not the police.

267
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:06,300
I wanted to bring him
back to life.

268
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,633
I wanted
to experiment on him.

269
00:27:09,933 --> 00:27:12,767
In fact,
I must!

270
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:16,633
I can restore him.

271
00:27:18,467 --> 00:27:22,200
You shot your assistant
just to experiment on him?

272
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:26,667
(Buckley snarling
and growling)

273
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,933
(snarling more intensely)

274
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:52,333
Dr. Meirschultz,

275
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:55,733
I have often heard
of your uncanny experiments,

276
00:27:55,733 --> 00:27:57,967
but this
tops them all.

277
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,667
But I think we speak
the same language.

278
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:06,567
Am I right?

279
00:28:06,567 --> 00:28:10,600
Well, I just don't get
what you mean, "same language".

280
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:14,767
We have
a common interest.

281
00:28:14,767 --> 00:28:17,900
When you bring your assistant
back to life,

282
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:22,467
his mind will do
as you direct.

283
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:25,933
You can do the same
to Buckley,

284
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:30,233
then he will do
as I direct.

285
00:28:33,767 --> 00:28:37,067
(snarling and growling)

286
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:55,967
Buckley
saw my body.

287
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:58,100
The police.

288
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,333
If they
should come--

289
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,867
I must
bring him back.

290
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,300
I'll find
that formula.

291
00:29:17,733 --> 00:29:18,967
Kitty,
kitty.

292
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:20,233
Kitty, kitty, kitty!

293
00:29:26,067 --> 00:29:27,500
Oh, hi,
Doc.

294
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,500
Say, a couple
of my cats got away.

295
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,967
You seen 'em
anywhere?

296
00:29:30,967 --> 00:29:32,067
Of course not.

297
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:34,233
What would I want
with your cats?

298
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:36,267
Well,
I didn't know.

299
00:29:36,267 --> 00:29:39,500
I thought, maybe, you know,
you might use 'em for--

300
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,367
well, some experiments
or something.

301
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:44,533
Me? Cats?

302
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,633
Never.

303
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:49,400
That is, I think
too much of Satan

304
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,467
to use cats
for experiments.

305
00:29:51,467 --> 00:29:53,833
Oh, that's what
I thought, you know.

306
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:01,800
Well, no harm meant,
Doc.

307
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,633
Well, so long.

308
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,033
(Satan growling)

309
00:30:17,867 --> 00:30:19,800
What am I
going to do?

310
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,633
The police will be here
any minute.

311
00:30:24,633 --> 00:30:27,867
I must dispose
of the body.

312
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,167
I'll hide it.

313
00:30:29,167 --> 00:30:31,600
I'll
burn it!

314
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,533
No, I can't do that.

315
00:30:37,267 --> 00:30:38,900
The basement!

316
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:47,767
(corpse's feet
thumping down steps)

317
00:31:02,067 --> 00:31:03,733
(tool clanging)

318
00:31:03,733 --> 00:31:05,900
(scratching)

319
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,600
(brick thumping)

320
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:29,567
Satan.

321
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:30,767
The gleam!

322
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,667
You
wretch.

323
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:38,200
Stand between me
and salvation, will you?

324
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,600
(chair clattering)

325
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,300
(metal pan clattering)

326
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:14,500
(Satan meows)

327
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,433
(Satan meows)

328
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,067
(glass shattering)

329
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:22,167
(laughs wildly)

330
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:34,300
Why, it's not unlike
an oyster or a grape.

331
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,833
(laughing wildly)

332
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:41,533
But the gleam
is gone.

333
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,867
(laughing wildly)

334
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,600
(laughing)

335
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:05,700
**

336
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,500
(growling)

337
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:14,200
Do you know a Dr. Meirschultz
and his assistant, Don Maxwell?

338
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,267
Sure.

339
00:34:15,267 --> 00:34:17,100
They're sort of queer,
I'd say.

340
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,367
There's lots of queer
goings-on up there.

341
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:22,067
Why, they even brought
a dead dog back to life once.

342
00:34:22,067 --> 00:34:23,933
That sounds
very remarkable to me.

343
00:34:23,933 --> 00:34:25,900
It may be,
but to my notion,

344
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,467
those that monkeys with
what they got no business to

345
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:30,100
gets queer
sooner or later.

346
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,167
Maybe you're right.

347
00:34:31,167 --> 00:34:32,600
I know I am.

348
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,167
Why, I even heard a shot
up there last night.

349
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:36,567
Why didn't you
notify the police?

350
00:34:36,567 --> 00:34:38,900
That's their business,
not mine.

351
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:54,367
I understand
from your neighbors

352
00:34:54,367 --> 00:34:56,633
that your cats
are making noise at night.

353
00:34:59,733 --> 00:35:02,067
Dr. Meirschultz
has complained.

354
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,267
Yeah?

355
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,400
Well, he's been stealing
my cats for his experiments.

356
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,400
I know.

357
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,800
I've been spying
on him.

358
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,967
How many cats
have you?

359
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:10,133
What's the matter--
rats?

360
00:35:10,133 --> 00:35:11,667
Oh, thousands
of them.

361
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:13,467
Right here
in my backyard.

362
00:35:13,467 --> 00:35:14,533
Thousands?

363
00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:16,267
Yeah, I got
a thousand cats too.

364
00:35:16,267 --> 00:35:17,667
Wanna see 'em?

365
00:35:17,667 --> 00:35:21,433
What's the idea--
you sell 'em?
Ah, no.

366
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:23,767
It's my own idea.

367
00:35:23,767 --> 00:35:25,167
(cats meowing)

368
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:27,633
I'm in
the business.

369
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,067
Fur business.

370
00:35:35,067 --> 00:35:37,367
Oh, I see,
cats' fur!

371
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:39,600
You get it quick.

372
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,300
Where do the rats
come in?

373
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,400
Ah, you ain't as quick
as I thought.

374
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,067
Look.

375
00:35:47,067 --> 00:35:53,200
You see, I figured out that
rats breed faster than cats.

376
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,367
And cats' skins
makes good fur.

377
00:35:57,367 --> 00:36:00,200
Cats eat rats,

378
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,533
and rats eat
raw meat.

379
00:36:02,533 --> 00:36:06,367
That is, they eat
the carcasses of the cats.

380
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:09,467
So the rats
eat the cats,

381
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,167
the cats eat
the rats

382
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:13,867
and I get
the skins.

383
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:18,567
Rats eating cats--
well, that is news!

384
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:20,167
Simple,
ain't it?

385
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:23,233
Say, by the way, did you
hear a shot last night?

386
00:36:23,233 --> 00:36:24,667
Maybe.

387
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:26,067
I don't know.

388
00:36:27,467 --> 00:36:31,067

389

392
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:50,400
Hey, Maizie, we know
you're hard-boiled.

393
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,267
You don't have to stay in the
water 30 minutes to prove it.

394
00:36:53,267 --> 00:36:54,733
Oh, let me alone.

395
00:36:54,733 --> 00:36:57,800
I may not be decent,
but I'm sure gonna be clean.

396
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,233
Say,

397
00:36:59,233 --> 00:37:01,667
if anyone is entitled to the
first place in that bathroom,

398
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:03,433
it should be me!

399
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:04,667
Didn't I sign
the register

400
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:07,133
and welcome you all
as secret guests?

401
00:37:10,533 --> 00:37:12,233
If it wasn't for
nervy little Alice,

402
00:37:12,233 --> 00:37:13,733
you'd all be sinking
your weary bones

403
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:16,467
into the soft recesses
of some park bench

404
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:18,833
with a light,
fleecy coverlet

405
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:22,167
made by
the great American press.

406
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:23,700
Press?

407
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,067
That reminds me.

408
00:37:25,067 --> 00:37:27,333
I have
pressing business!

409
00:37:43,433 --> 00:37:45,433
Here's one
for the books:

410
00:37:45,433 --> 00:37:47,067
"Sandwich man
pounding pavements

411
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:49,867
"walks onto a wallet
with 42 grand in it!"

412
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:52,467
I'd like
to find that man.

413
00:37:52,467 --> 00:37:54,233
Maybe we could
sandwich him in.

414
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:55,467
Can you imagine?

415
00:37:55,467 --> 00:37:56,800
The darn fool
turned it in.

416
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,167
His head must be
a jelly bean

417
00:37:58,167 --> 00:38:01,233
instead of what
they thought it was.

418
00:38:01,233 --> 00:38:02,533
(machine vibrating)

419
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:04,233
Well, it sure was soft
all right,

420
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:06,900
but would it be soft
to land on 42 grand!

421
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,867
Yeah,
but listen!

422
00:38:08,867 --> 00:38:10,200
After he turned
it in,

423
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,133
people made such a fuss over him
that he went nutty.

424
00:38:12,133 --> 00:38:14,133
Thought he was
the Almighty in person.

425
00:38:14,133 --> 00:38:16,167
So that's what being honest
gets you--

426
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:19,100
a nice, soft, padded cell
in the bug house.

427

(singing)
* La Cucaracha,
la cocka-roacha-- *

00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:24,400
* Dah dee dah
da-da-da dum *

429
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,067
It's pretty tough.

430
00:38:26,067 --> 00:38:27,900
Imagine
the poor guy.

431
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:32,133
I'll bet nobody noticed him
all his life and then--

432
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:35,067
Say, wasn't there
some guy in history

433
00:38:35,067 --> 00:38:37,333
that spent all his life
looking for an honest man?

434
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:40,367
Sure, in his day,
men were men,

435
00:38:40,367 --> 00:38:44,167
but today, they're too scared
to be anything but honest.

436
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:49,300
Yeah, but a brave guy
can sure get away with plenty!

437
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,467
Say, you must've
been reading the papers.

438
00:38:51,467 --> 00:38:53,233
Or maybe you've been
drinking crazy water

439
00:38:53,233 --> 00:38:54,833
and your head's
wiggly.

440
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,067
Be yourself, Alice.

441
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,567
Playing the heavy-heavy
don't suit you.

442
00:38:58,567 --> 00:39:00,867
Aw, it's getting
me down.

443
00:39:00,867 --> 00:39:04,067
Always broke
and never a break.

444
00:39:04,067 --> 00:39:05,600
Why don't you ditch
that ham

445
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,467
and pick yourself
a rich husband?

446
00:39:07,467 --> 00:39:08,833
(Alice)
Rich husband?

447
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:11,067
I've heard they come
that way.

448
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:12,667
Not very often.

449
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:14,533
Often enough,
but not our way.

450
00:39:14,533 --> 00:39:16,367
Oh, the girl
has brains!

451
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:17,700
You don't have to put
a zipper on it

452
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,133
to call or prove
it either.

453
00:39:19,133 --> 00:39:20,167
Alice!

454
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:21,533
Listen to this.

455
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:24,900
"Don Maxwell, personality
impersonator, gets lucky break."

456
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,700
Why, that's your husband,
ain't it?

457
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,633
Pipe down,
will you?

458
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:29,833
Let her read it.

459
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:31,233
"By queer quirk
of fate,

460

of him lately."

464
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:41,600
The lucky
ham!

465
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,700
From now on, he'll have
the company of a good egg.

466
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,833
Will wonders
ever cease?

467
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:52,900
Say, I wonder if he's still
with that goofy professor.

468
00:39:56,067 --> 00:39:58,167
He's inherited
a fortune!

469
00:39:58,167 --> 00:40:00,233
You say a fortune?

470
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,100
He never spoke to me
of any rich relatives.

471
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,533
He hardly knew
of them himself.

472
00:40:06,533 --> 00:40:09,467
I believe it was
his uncle in Australia.

473
00:40:09,467 --> 00:40:12,533
I am certainly glad
to hear that.

474
00:40:12,533 --> 00:40:14,767
I'm sure
he'll be pleased.

475
00:40:14,767 --> 00:40:17,067
Oh, but--
don't tell him.

476
00:40:17,067 --> 00:40:20,567
You see, I want to tell him
the news first.

477
00:40:20,567 --> 00:40:22,633
That's only
natural.

478
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:27,100
Mrs. Maxwell, your husband
will be here at 8:00 tonight.

479
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:29,333
All right.

480
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,733
**

481
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,633
The gleam.

482
00:41:56,633 --> 00:42:01,333
It was in Meirschultz's eyes
when he wanted to murder me.

483
00:42:03,467 --> 00:42:06,367
It was
in Mrs. Buckley's eyes

484
00:42:06,367 --> 00:42:09,067
when she wanted
to murder her husband.

485
00:42:09,067 --> 00:42:12,333
Alice had the gleam in her eye
when she wanted to find me.

486
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:18,167
She'd murder me.

487
00:42:18,167 --> 00:42:20,800
That's what she wants
to do!

488
00:42:21,867 --> 00:42:25,333
I must get rid
of her.

489
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:27,400
But how?

490
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,567
Mrs. Buckley!

491
00:42:31,567 --> 00:42:34,833
She will
help.

492
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:37,133
She
 must help!

493
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,700
Oh, we are lost!

494
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,100
You are right.

495
00:42:44,633 --> 00:42:47,533
But before I can get him
back here,

496
00:42:47,533 --> 00:42:49,400
you will have
to help me.

497
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,067
Mrs. Maxwell
is crazy.

498
00:42:52,067 --> 00:42:54,267
She will be here
any minute.

499
00:42:54,267 --> 00:42:57,133
She thinks that
 I murdered her husband

500
00:42:57,133 --> 00:42:59,433
and wants to turn me over
to the police.

501
00:42:59,433 --> 00:43:02,933
We must keep her subdued
till I can get Buckley.

502
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,967
Down in the basement
is a secret vault.

503
00:43:11,067 --> 00:43:13,467
We will put her
down there.

504
00:43:15,067 --> 00:43:18,633
You quiet her
by jabbing this in her arm

505
00:43:18,633 --> 00:43:21,900
and in the meantime,
I will go get Buckley.

506
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,100
It sounds
all right.

507
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,700
Except the fact
 she's crazy.

508
00:43:28,767 --> 00:43:32,200
It seems to me
she has the right idea.

509
00:43:33,267 --> 00:43:36,700
So you feel
that way too.

510
00:43:39,067 --> 00:43:40,600
Stay in there.

511
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,933
I'll call you
when needed.

512
00:43:48,433 --> 00:43:50,467
At last, I've really secured
a living for us.

513
00:43:50,467 --> 00:43:52,400
We can travel
or anything we want.

514
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,967
Then you knew
of the inheritance?

515
00:43:54,967 --> 00:43:56,167
Sure.

516
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:57,967
I have one little job
to accomplish,

517
00:43:57,967 --> 00:43:59,900
then we can
leave together.

518
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,800
No doubt you are surprised
at this disguise?

519
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,167
Oh, no.

520
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:06,533
I wouldn't be surprised
at anything from you.

521
00:44:06,533 --> 00:44:07,933
Now, honey.

522
00:44:07,933 --> 00:44:10,067
You are here in time
to help me.

523
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:13,100
I knew there was a catch
in this someplace.

524
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,533
Let's spill it.

525
00:44:15,533 --> 00:44:16,867
In the other room,

526
00:44:16,867 --> 00:44:19,700
I have a crazy woman
I've been treating.

527
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,800
(scoffing)
Ha ha!

528
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,733
So you've
been "treating"!

529
00:44:22,733 --> 00:44:24,067
Quiet,
will you?

530
00:44:24,067 --> 00:44:25,433
This is serious.

531
00:44:25,433 --> 00:44:27,267
Our lives
are in danger.

532
00:44:27,267 --> 00:44:29,300
What do you mean,
"our"?

533
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,700
That's what
I said.

534
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,233
Now listen to me.

535
00:44:32,233 --> 00:44:36,667
I want you to help me
take this woman downstairs.

536
00:44:37,733 --> 00:44:39,867
I'll give her
a shot,

537
00:44:39,867 --> 00:44:43,333
then you take care of her
till I get help.

538
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:47,067
(fearfully)
Well, how about me
getting the help?

539
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,167
She's quiet now,
isn't she?

540
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:55,467
Yes, but she'll break out
any minute.

541
00:44:55,467 --> 00:44:58,067
She's not afraid
of a woman,

542
00:44:58,067 --> 00:45:00,367
so if she happens
to get wild,

543
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:03,200
just shove this
into her arm.

544
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,333
Keep it hid.

545
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:07,400
And all
will be well.

546
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,200
All right,
Mrs. Buckley.

547
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,700
We will
go downstairs now.

548
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,500
I have a special treatment
room there.

549
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,767
(door slamming)

550
00:45:57,767 --> 00:46:01,767
(both screaming)

551
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:12,067
(laughing wildly)

552
00:46:19,533 --> 00:46:22,067
laughter continues)

553
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,900
(women squeal)

554
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,900
(both screaming)

555
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,600
(laughing wildly)

556
00:46:34,467 --> 00:46:37,267
(both grunting,
breathing hard)

557
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,367
(shrieking)

558
00:46:47,667 --> 00:46:50,100
(laughing)

559
00:46:53,967 --> 00:46:56,267
(police sirens wailing)

560
00:46:59,467 --> 00:47:01,067
(screaming)

561
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,367
(screaming)

562
00:47:04,367 --> 00:47:05,633
(heavy thudding)

563
00:47:05,633 --> 00:47:07,900
(wings fluttering)

564
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,433
(shrieking)

565
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,633
(glass shattering)

566
00:47:12,633 --> 00:47:14,700
(sirens wailing)

567
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,967
(laughing)

568
00:47:17,967 --> 00:47:20,233
(siren winding down)

569
00:47:23,367 --> 00:47:25,300
(laughing)

570
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,633
Look in that room,
Parker.

571
00:47:27,633 --> 00:47:29,433
You come
with me, Penny.

572
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:31,067
(door opens)

573
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,067
I've got orders to search this
place and take everyone in it

574
00:47:36,067 --> 00:47:38,167
down to headquarters
for questioning.

575
00:47:38,167 --> 00:47:39,633
(screaming)

576
00:47:39,633 --> 00:47:40,633
(thud)

577
00:47:40,633 --> 00:47:41,633
(screaming)

578
00:47:41,633 --> 00:47:42,633
What is that?

579
00:47:42,633 --> 00:47:45,067
(laughing wildly)
Nothing!

580
00:47:45,067 --> 00:47:48,267
A couple of my patients
having a little argument.

581
00:47:48,267 --> 00:47:49,567
Take me
down there!

582
00:47:49,567 --> 00:47:51,067
It won't do
any good.

583
00:47:51,067 --> 00:47:53,933
There are a couple of would-be
murderesses fighting it out!

584
00:47:53,933 --> 00:47:54,967
Man,
you're crazy.

585
00:47:54,967 --> 00:47:57,067
What kind
of a place is this?

586
00:47:57,067 --> 00:47:59,067
Oh-- I'm crazy,
am I?

587
00:47:59,067 --> 00:48:01,500
Let me
tell you something.

588
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,200
Those women
have the gleam!

589
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,633
No use in
wasting time!

590
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:07,500
(grunting,
struggling)

591
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,933
Come on,
get going.

592
00:48:08,933 --> 00:48:11,300
(women screaming)

593
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,667
No-- no!

594
00:48:19,067 --> 00:48:21,433
(women shrieking)

595
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:24,200
(officer)
Quiet down!

596
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:28,067
(cat meows loudly
inside the wall)

597
00:48:31,067 --> 00:48:32,533
(cat yowling)

598
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:37,200
What's
behind this wall?

599
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,167
Penny, tear
this wall down.

600
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,233
Murderous Satan.

601
00:48:41,233 --> 00:48:44,067
The rats haven't eaten
Meirschultz entirely!

602
00:48:44,067 --> 00:48:46,233
He still has
the gleam!

603
00:48:46,233 --> 00:48:48,600
(laughing wildly)

604
00:48:52,267 --> 00:48:54,733
(both)
Why, he's crazy!

605
00:48:54,733 --> 00:48:59,233
(tool and bricks
clattering)

606
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:11,967
**

607
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,433
The gleam!

608
00:50:07,433 --> 00:50:09,900
They drove me to it,
I tell you.

609
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,000
They drove me
with hunger,

610
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,033
with misery
and humiliation.

611
00:50:16,133 --> 00:50:19,367
I only wanted to amuse,
to entertain.

612
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:22,633
But here I am.

613
00:50:22,633 --> 00:50:27,500
Spent my life in
perfecting an unknown method

614
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,600
no one appreciates!

615
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,833
But...

616
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:35,033
I showed them.

617
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:37,433
Dr. Meirschultz!

618
00:50:37,433 --> 00:50:39,667
A real
impersonation!

619
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:42,367
(laughing wildly)

620
00:50:45,267 --> 00:50:47,367
Meirschultz!

621
00:50:47,367 --> 00:50:50,833
My supreme
impersonation!

622
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:54,300
**
