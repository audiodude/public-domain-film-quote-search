1
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:48,339
- That's fine. Here you are.
- Thank you.

2
00:01:49,826 --> 00:01:51,767
Gee... that's swelll photography.

3
00:01:52,473 --> 00:01:55,200
Well, we better get back to the hotel
and get our things packed...

4
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,760
because the boat sails
at 12 o'clock tonight.

5
00:01:57,972 --> 00:01:59,418
Not for me, it doesn't.

6
00:01:59,626 --> 00:02:00,943
What do you mean?

7
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:03,008
I've decided to stay a while.

8
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,574
In fact, if my plans work out right...

9
00:02:05,787 --> 00:02:07,679
I may never go back!

10
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:11,282
Oh, we have to go back or we'll lose
our job at the fish market in Des Moines.

11
00:02:11,493 --> 00:02:12,891
So what?

12
00:02:13,105 --> 00:02:15,916
There're plenty of fish markets
here in Paris.

13
00:02:17,402 --> 00:02:18,577
- Garçon!

14
00:02:19,174 --> 00:02:20,036
- Oui, Monsieur?

15
00:02:20,217 --> 00:02:23,686
Another glass of milk
and two fresh straws.

16
00:02:29,768 --> 00:02:32,869
You know what? I think you're hiding
something from me.

17
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,751
Oh... Roses are red, candy is sweet...

18
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:51,629
This is something I sent you to eat.
Ollie.

19
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:54,617
That's so funny!

20
00:02:55,196 --> 00:02:56,595
But the flowers are beautiful.

21
00:02:58,008 --> 00:02:59,407
Candy!

22
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,015
Who is he?

23
00:03:01,234 --> 00:03:02,843
He's the American guest in number 4.

24
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:04,788
We must not ridiciule his generosity.

25
00:03:04,996 --> 00:03:07,430
Really he's been very kind.

26
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,625
Mr. Hardy!

27
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:32,774
Yes, Ma'am?

28
00:03:33,897 --> 00:03:36,826
- I want to thank you for your photograph.
- You're welcome!

29
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,932
And for beautiful flowers...

30
00:03:39,148 --> 00:03:41,664
Oh, shucks. It was just a thought...

31
00:03:42,084 --> 00:03:43,977
...and the delicious chocolate!

32
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,957
Well, I thought you might want
sometning to nibble on...

33
00:03:47,179 --> 00:03:50,200
...while you were smelling the flowers.

34
00:04:11,994 --> 00:04:13,691
What are you so happy about?

35
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:16,003
Stanley, can you keep a secret?

36
00:04:16,219 --> 00:04:17,243
Sure!

37
00:04:17,461 --> 00:04:18,568
I'm in love!

38
00:04:18,786 --> 00:04:20,895
You don't tell me! Who is it?

39
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:24,746
The most gorgeus
creature in the world.

40
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,349
Georgette, the innkeeper's daughter.

41
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:30,630
Well, I don't blame you.
She sure is a swell dish.

42
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,619
- She certainly...
- Yes, sir!

43
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,593
Don't call her a dish.
She's the girl that I'm going to marry!

44
00:04:36,804 --> 00:04:38,701
Get a load of this diamond ring.

45
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:47,483
Boy, it sure is a load.

46
00:04:47,782 --> 00:04:49,052
Yes, sir!

47
00:04:49,272 --> 00:04:50,886
Say, when are you going to get married?

48
00:04:51,096 --> 00:04:52,743
Just as soon as I ask her.

49
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,562
Why don't you ask her now.
Then, we can all go out and celebrate.

50
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:57,554
That's just what I intended to do.

51
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,367
We'll get cleaned up
and I'll go down and pop the question!

52
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,235
That's a good idea!

53
00:05:02,474 --> 00:05:04,500
I'm sure we'll have
a lot of fun now!

54
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:07,266
You sure can pick 'em!
I never saw anything like you get...

55
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:38,914
What are you doing with that cushion?

56
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,480
Well, I keep on bumping "me" head.

57
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,166
See?!

58
00:05:45,924 --> 00:05:48,315
Move it in front of the the window
were you can stand up.

59
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,664
How anyone can be so stupid to stand there...

60
00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:31,893
and continually bump their head
is beyond me!

61
00:06:49,546 --> 00:06:50,994
Why you didn't stand by the window?

62
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,677
Why don't you mind your own business?!

63
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,196
What is all this?
Holler... Yes I'm sorry.

64
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,343
Papa... it's this.
The girls think he's funny.

65
00:07:01,765 --> 00:07:03,296
Yes, it is funny yes...

66
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:05,813
But remember Georgette,
you are a married woman...

67
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,681
and François's little bit jealous.

68
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:11,327
Oh... papa.

69
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,602
He's not serious.
It's just the American way of having fun.

70
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:15,223
Oh, yes., yes. Might be.

71
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:18,207
Well... run along... girls...

72
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:20,809
Come, come, come...

73
00:07:25,626 --> 00:07:26,650
François!

74
00:07:29,484 --> 00:07:30,299
François.

75
00:07:30,495 --> 00:07:32,325
- It is so good to see you.
- After such a long time!

76
00:07:32,543 --> 00:07:34,074
Why didn't you let us know you were coming?

77
00:07:34,282 --> 00:07:36,756
I wanted to surprise Georgette.
Where is she?

78
00:07:38,766 --> 00:07:40,093
George... Georgette!

79
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:46,141
Yes, papa.

80
00:07:47,212 --> 00:07:48,226
François!

81
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,580
My darling Georgette! I've waited every day...
every hour... every minute.

82
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:55,695
My poor François!

83
00:07:55,859 --> 00:07:58,214
I was worried about you,
way out in that lonely post in Morocco!

84
00:07:58,427 --> 00:08:01,113
It was lonely, terribly lonely.
But that's all over now.

85
00:08:01,492 --> 00:08:04,472
I've got great news for you.
I made arrangements for you to join me
when I go back.

86
00:08:04,682 --> 00:08:06,543
Oh, darling. I am so happy!

87
00:08:10,811 --> 00:08:13,166
You must be hungry.
I'll get you something to eat.

88
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:18,967
Well, how about a nice cold drink?

89
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:22,323
That's great.
It'll just put me in the mood.

90
00:08:23,074 --> 00:08:24,345
Yes, sir.

91
00:08:38,358 --> 00:08:39,841
Throw it over your shoulder.

92
00:09:20,937 --> 00:09:22,339
What can I do for you?

93
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,221
My friend and I would like a bottle of wine.
And bring three glasses.

94
00:09:26,886 --> 00:09:28,041
Three glasses?

95
00:09:28,295 --> 00:09:29,991
We thought maybe you'd like to join us.

96
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,965
You know I feel as fidgety as a jitterbug.

97
00:09:35,253 --> 00:09:36,737
You do? What's the matter?

98
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:41,052
Well I'm nervous!
You know, Stanley, this will be the first time
I've ever been married.

99
00:09:43,903 --> 00:09:46,329
- Say... now is a good time.
- Shhhhh!

100
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,685
Go on now. Why, don't you?

101
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:48,911
Go on, tell her.

102
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:50,455
What's the matter, you scared?

103
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:53,762
I'll tell her for you.
I know just how you feel.

104
00:09:53,768 --> 00:09:57,211
- Let me fix it for you.
- I can fix it. Just leave it...

105
00:09:58,091 --> 00:10:00,235
Say... He got something to tell you.

106
00:10:00,743 --> 00:10:03,840
- Something to tell me?
- Yes, he is "nuts" about you.

107
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:07,036
- "Nuts"?
- Just plain nuts!

108
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:09,122
Oh, oui!

109
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:14,487
No, I don't mean that...
I mean he's crazy about you!

110
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:17,221
He's going to marry you!
Aren't you, Ollie?

111
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:19,332
Go on, start talking.

112
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:22,272
You want to marry me?

113
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,543
That is, if you don't mind.

114
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:28,275
Monsieur, youn make fun of me.

115
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:30,799
No, he's not kidding.
He's on the level.

116
00:10:30,905 --> 00:10:31,992
Aren't you, Ollie?

117
00:10:32,677 --> 00:10:34,078
Why... certainly.

118
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,810
I was never more sincere in my life.

119
00:10:38,807 --> 00:10:41,033
That's very nice of you, I'm sure.

120
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,190
But that can never be...

121
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,757
Won't you give me one chance,
Georgette?

122
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,832
Go on... why don't you?!

123
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:50,486
Is there someone else?

124
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:53,430
Yes, very much so.

125
00:10:54,464 --> 00:10:55,914
I'm so sorry.

126
00:11:05,813 --> 00:11:07,510
Well, that's that!

127
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:10,483
No use crying over split milk.

128
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:13,883
Well, I guess we better be going, eh?
Come on...

129
00:11:14,097 --> 00:11:15,252
You, go ahead.

130
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,281
What's the matter?
Aren't you going out with me?

131
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:23,368
I want to be... alone.

132
00:12:02,684 --> 00:12:03,756
Don't be long, darling.

133
00:12:03,968 --> 00:12:06,441
No, darling but it's absolutely necessary
that I report to Headquarters.

134
00:12:06,661 --> 00:12:09,134
- You'll be back right away?
- Just as soon as I can.

135
00:12:17,595 --> 00:12:20,693
Don't worry about it,
you'll get over it all right.

136
00:12:31,346 --> 00:12:34,114
To think...
that this would happen to me.

137
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:36,645
Just at the time in my life...

138
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,998
when I needed something real.

139
00:12:39,465 --> 00:12:41,408
Something wholesome...

140
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:44,931
something tender...

141
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,037
Why don't you try a nice fat, juicy steak?

142
00:12:48,288 --> 00:12:50,596
That would make you feel better,
if you have something to eat.

143
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,923
You don't understand.

144
00:12:54,624 --> 00:12:56,688
Get me some smelling salts.

145
00:13:12,436 --> 00:13:13,920
That better now?

146
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,699
Get... get...

147
00:13:18,442 --> 00:13:19,631
...won't come out!

148
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,206
Get... get this off!

149
00:13:39,316 --> 00:13:41,460
Put some water on my head.

150
00:13:52,243 --> 00:13:53,692
Get a towel!

151
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,513
That. Now, is that better?

152
00:14:02,226 --> 00:14:03,840
Make it wet.

153
00:14:18,711 --> 00:14:20,325
Is  there anything else I can do for you?

154
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:23,090
Yes! Leave me alone!

155
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,317
Don't talk to me like that
after all the hospital I've given you.

156
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,168
I tried to give you a candy...
A nice fat, juicy steak.

157
00:14:32,712 --> 00:14:34,902
I've waited on you with your hands and feet.

158
00:14:35,155 --> 00:14:38,995
Tried to tell you that there's plenty more girls...
You don't have to worry about that...

159
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:44,703
If I felt as bad as you,
I'd go and drown myself.

160
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,234
- Stanley, you've given me an idea.
- What?

161
00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:51,804
- I'm going to follow your advice...
- Good.

162
00:14:51,806 --> 00:14:53,585
...and drown myself.

163
00:14:54,118 --> 00:14:56,557
Oh, wait a minute now. Listen...
I was only kidding.

164
00:14:56,978 --> 00:14:59,121
This is no time for kidding.

165
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,894
I know, but don't you think you ought
to think it over?
Have you ever been drowned before?

166
00:15:02,114 --> 00:15:05,541
I have thought it over... and since Georgette
has given me the air...

167
00:15:05,758 --> 00:15:07,619
I have nothing left to live for?

168
00:15:07,831 --> 00:15:08,902
Oh, don't be silly.

169
00:15:09,114 --> 00:15:10,892
What do you mean, "Don't be silly"?

170
00:15:11,101 --> 00:15:13,952
This is a far, far better thing I do now...

171
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:17,064
than I have ever done before.

172
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:19,737
Stand up.

173
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:26,161
- Well... Goodbye, Ollie.
- Goodbye, Stanley.

174
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,477
Good luck.

175
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,800
Where are you going?

176
00:16:29,185 --> 00:16:31,871
Well, I don't want to get my name
dragged into this.

177
00:16:39,087 --> 00:16:40,157
What...?

178
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:44,618
- What's this for?
- Now, when I count three, we'll both jump in.

179
00:16:45,453 --> 00:16:48,267
What have I got to jump in there for?
I'm not in love!

180
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:51,252
So that's the kind of guy you are...
After all I've done for you...

181
00:16:51,313 --> 00:16:53,311
let me jump in there alone.

182
00:16:53,822 --> 00:16:56,424
Do you realize that after I'm gone...

183
00:16:56,637 --> 00:16:59,108
that you will just go on living by yourself?

184
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:02,672
People would stare at you
and wonder what you are?

185
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:05,277
And I wouldn't be here to tell them.

186
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,562
There'd be no one to protect you.

187
00:17:08,102 --> 00:17:10,374
Do you want that to happen to you?

188
00:17:12,493 --> 00:17:14,305
I never thought of that.

189
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,326
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings, Ollie.

190
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:19,979
I didn't mean to be so dispolite.

191
00:17:20,191 --> 00:17:23,829
That's all right, Stanley.
Let bygones be bygones.

192
00:17:24,247 --> 00:17:26,973
This is going to be easier than you think.

193
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:28,914
Now, move this over here for me.

194
00:17:42,627 --> 00:17:44,073
Don't do that.

195
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:46,754
Are you ready?

196
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:51,067
- Goodbye, Ollie.
- Goodbye, Stanley.

197
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,258
One... two...

198
00:17:57,311 --> 00:17:58,656
- Ollie.
- What?

199
00:17:58,764 --> 00:17:59,631
I just thought of something.

200
00:18:00,055 --> 00:18:03,299
Listen, you remember once
you were telling me that...

201
00:18:03,323 --> 00:18:06,550
when we passed away we'd come back
on this earth in some other form?

202
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:09,522
Like a bird or dog or a horse or something?

203
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:11,971
- Oh, you mean reincarnation.
- Yeah, yeah, that's it.

204
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,227
Well, now that we are going to go,
what would you like to be
when you come back?

205
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:19,171
Well, I don't know.
I've never given it much thought.

206
00:18:19,757 --> 00:18:21,405
I like horses.

207
00:18:21,703 --> 00:18:24,039
- I guess I'd like to come back as a horse.
- Huh!

208
00:18:24,476 --> 00:18:26,206
What would you like to be
when you come back?

209
00:18:26,421 --> 00:18:28,562
I would like to come back as myself.

210
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,971
I always get along swell with me.

211
00:18:31,181 --> 00:18:33,406
You can't come back as yourself!

212
00:18:33,623 --> 00:18:36,601
Now come on and stop wasting my time!

213
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:38,046
Are you ready?

214
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,409
- Goodbye, Ollie.
- Goodbye!

215
00:18:42,095 --> 00:18:44,371
One... two...

216
00:18:44,939 --> 00:18:47,457
Ollie?
Just thought of something.

217
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,140
Do you think the water is deep enough?
Maybe you might bump your head, if...

218
00:18:53,443 --> 00:18:55,384
Well, I never thought of that.

219
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:36,080
Termites.

220
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,066
Hey...

221
00:19:43,761 --> 00:19:46,524
We can't jump in there.
There's a fellow watching us.

222
00:19:50,844 --> 00:19:53,121
What are you trying to do?
Talk me out of this?

223
00:19:54,477 --> 00:19:57,612
I came here to jump in this river
and that's what we're going to do!

224
00:19:58,036 --> 00:20:00,406
Now you quit this horsing around,
or I'll jump in without you!

225
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,513
Don't leave me, Ollie!

226
00:20:02,731 --> 00:20:04,336
Well... are you ready?
All right.

227
00:20:04,446 --> 00:20:05,454
- Goodbye, Ollie.
- Shut up!

228
00:20:06,845 --> 00:20:09,625
One... two...

229
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:13,001
Pardon me, gentlemen.
What seems to be the trouble?

230
00:20:13,766 --> 00:20:15,651
Well, if you don't mind,
we're going to jump in the river.

231
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,126
But why to commit such a foolish action?

232
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,533
Surely your troubles can't be
as bad as all that.

233
00:20:20,743 --> 00:20:22,521
Well, that's what I have been
trying to tell him.

234
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:26,486
All because he fell in love with a dame.
Now, isn't that silly?

235
00:20:26,704 --> 00:20:29,354
- No woman is worth that.
- I should say not.

236
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,600
You haven't seen her!
If you knew her as I know her.

237
00:20:32,996 --> 00:20:36,257
I understand. But don't forget.
There are plenty more fish in the sea.

238
00:20:36,556 --> 00:20:39,450
He is not in love with a fish...
It's a girl.

239
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,824
- That's just an expression, my friend.
- Oh.

240
00:20:41,937 --> 00:20:45,658
I realize perfectly how you feel,
but you've too much to live for.

241
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,893
Sure, you got your dog and there's me...

242
00:20:48,105 --> 00:20:50,623
Life is too precious to throw away on account of...

243
00:20:50,836 --> 00:20:52,778
of some woman who probably
isn't worthy of you.

244
00:20:52,989 --> 00:20:54,094
He is right, Ollie.

245
00:20:54,355 --> 00:20:57,451
She is worthy, all right.
But there was another man...

246
00:20:57,665 --> 00:21:02,587
and if I could meet him face to face,
what I'd to him would be nobody's business.

247
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,111
Yes, sir!

248
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,142
Well, advice is cheap.

249
00:21:06,358 --> 00:21:09,420
Maybe if you'd listen to my
suggestion your problem would be solved.

250
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:10,823
What is your suggestion?

251
00:21:11,035 --> 00:21:13,013
Join the Foreign Legion.

252
00:21:13,851 --> 00:21:15,910
- What for?!
- To forget.

253
00:21:17,327 --> 00:21:19,304
Say, that's not a bad idea, Ollie.

254
00:21:19,521 --> 00:21:22,205
Better than jumping in here...
We could forget all our troubles...

255
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:23,655
You're right, Stanley.

256
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,124
- Thank you, mister for telling us.
- It was a pleasure.

257
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,564
- Goodbye and good luck.
- Goodbye.

258
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,066
Gee... that's great, isn't it?

259
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:33,714
- No we don't have...
- Say, we can't join the Foreign Legion.

260
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:36,960
We gotta to be back in Des Moines
on the 17th.

261
00:21:37,054 --> 00:21:38,034
Well, you ready?

262
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:39,979
- One...
- Just a minute, Ollie.

263
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,106
Hey, mister!

264
00:21:42,158 --> 00:21:45,357
If we join the Foreign Legion,
how long will it take him to forget?

265
00:21:45,398 --> 00:21:48,485
No time at all.
Just a matter of a few days.

266
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,186
- Well, that's swell.
We'll have plenty of time. - Great.

267
00:21:52,343 --> 00:21:53,326
Now we don't have to worry about it.

268
00:21:53,535 --> 00:21:55,721
- Say, we won't need this, will we?
- No.

269
00:23:08,822 --> 00:23:10,816
Right shoulder... arms!

270
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:15,825
Present... arms!

271
00:23:18,307 --> 00:23:20,348
Order... arms!

272
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,885
Take command, Captain.

273
00:23:28,461 --> 00:23:31,045
Lieutenant, close order drill.
Prepare the platoon.

274
00:23:31,154 --> 00:23:32,129
Positive.

275
00:23:42,874 --> 00:23:45,364
These clothes sure don't fit you
very well, do they?

276
00:23:45,472 --> 00:23:46,922
Oh, they'll be all right for now.

277
00:23:47,141 --> 00:23:49,815
We only use them for a few days...
until I forget.

278
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:51,035
That's right too.

279
00:23:51,143 --> 00:23:52,271
Left time.

280
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,215
Left!

281
00:23:56,395 --> 00:23:59,225
Right shoulder... fire.

282
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,984
Walk left... march!

283
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,588
Left flank... march!

284
00:24:07,795 --> 00:24:08,817
Turn around!

285
00:24:09,036 --> 00:24:11,389
Right flank... turn around!

286
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:13,542
Column... turn around!

287
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:44,614
Pardon us.

288
00:24:47,635 --> 00:24:50,812
Well, look who's here!
Hey, Ollie. Look.

289
00:24:51,027 --> 00:24:53,678
Well, blow me down.
Ha, ha, ha...

290
00:24:53,923 --> 00:24:57,065
What a small worldl!
Well, we followed your advice.

291
00:24:57,315 --> 00:24:59,045
Yeah, but nothing has happened yet,
has it, Ollie?

292
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,365
- Show this men to the Commandant.
- Yes, sir!

293
00:25:02,008 --> 00:25:05,004
- Well, we'll be seeing you. Goodbye.
- Yeah, take good care of yourself.

294
00:25:05,217 --> 00:25:07,606
- Don't he look good?
- Sure he does.

295
00:25:08,826 --> 00:25:12,366
Hey, hey...
When're you gonna have dinner?

296
00:25:13,698 --> 00:25:14,851
- Attention!

297
00:25:16,826 --> 00:25:17,980
- Goodbye.

298
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:32,893
Good morning.

299
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:35,704
I will now assign you to your duties.

300
00:25:35,914 --> 00:25:37,609
Revelie at 5, you dress quickly...

301
00:25:37,818 --> 00:25:39,876
make up your bunks
and get ready for inspection.

302
00:25:40,134 --> 00:25:43,312
Inspection until 7.
10 minutes till breakfast.

303
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:46,210
You drill until until 1
and march until 4.

304
00:25:47,431 --> 00:25:48,690
What about lunch?

305
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:50,467
You'll have that while marching.

306
00:25:50,681 --> 00:25:52,828
You'll have inspection until 6.

307
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:55,593
15 minutes for mess,
kitchen duties until 10...

308
00:25:55,814 --> 00:25:59,484
inspection at 11, then taps.
That is all.

309
00:25:59,612 --> 00:26:02,997
If we have to do all that,
you won't have time to forget.
Why don't you tell him?

310
00:26:03,518 --> 00:26:05,976
Uuuh, how much do we get
for all this work?

311
00:26:06,088 --> 00:26:07,526
100 centimes a day.

312
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,140
Well, that's not bad.

313
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:12,413
Uh, how much is that
in American money?

314
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:14,068
Oh, American money?

315
00:26:14,276 --> 00:26:16,582
It's equivalent to about 3 cents a day.

316
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,188
Of course it varies
with the rate of exchange.

317
00:26:19,655 --> 00:26:21,349
Well, how much do we get
for overtime?

318
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:23,745
There ain't gonna be any overtime.

319
00:26:23,956 --> 00:26:28,958
If you think you're going to get
that much work out of me
for 3 cents a day, brother...

320
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,652
you are crazy.

321
00:26:30,866 --> 00:26:34,290
- Is that so?
- Absolutely!

322
00:26:34,507 --> 00:26:36,566
Yeah, and that goes for me too.

323
00:26:36,782 --> 00:26:40,041
Cause we don't work for less
than 25 cents a day.

324
00:26:40,258 --> 00:26:41,491
Do we, Ollie?

325
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:42,534
Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh...

326
00:29:19,746 --> 00:29:22,429
Come on, get to work!
What do you think this is?

327
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:31,196
Get back to work!

328
00:30:40,546 --> 00:30:41,701
Get back to work!

329
00:30:54,613 --> 00:30:57,871
Haven't I got enough trouble
without you making it tougher?

330
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,407
Well, it's your own fault.

331
00:30:59,619 --> 00:31:02,796
If you hadn't fallen in love with
Georgette, we wouldn't be here.

332
00:31:02,802 --> 00:31:05,420
- Wouldn't that...
- Will you stop reminding me of that?!

333
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:10,784
Here I am trying to forget and you
keep talking about it all the time!
Now here's another day wasted!

334
00:31:11,975 --> 00:31:14,451
Well, maybe you don't try hard enough.

335
00:31:14,795 --> 00:31:17,843
If you can't forget,
why don't you try to pretend to forget?

336
00:31:18,052 --> 00:31:20,896
How can anybody pretend to forget?

337
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:24,201
Well, I know if it was me,
I'd sit down and relax.

338
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:28,002
I would close my eyes and concentrate
and I'd think of nothing.

339
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,116
Wouldn't be long then.
That's what I'd do.

340
00:31:30,325 --> 00:31:32,548
Say, I think you've got something there.

341
00:31:32,764 --> 00:31:35,693
I know I've got something.
Why don't you take a whirl at it?

342
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:42,636
Now don't think of anything.

343
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,326
I won't.

344
00:31:45,784 --> 00:31:48,839
I know it's tough to forget
a swell girl like that.

345
00:31:49,131 --> 00:31:52,469
Gorgeous hair and lovely eyes...

346
00:31:53,841 --> 00:31:55,075
beautiful teeth...

347
00:31:56,571 --> 00:31:57,838
Ruby lips...

348
00:31:59,297 --> 00:32:00,401
Gorgeous!

349
00:32:01,777 --> 00:32:03,221
I can see her now.

350
00:32:06,447 --> 00:32:07,810
So can I.

351
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:09,954
Will you shut up?

352
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:13,469
How can I concentrate when you
keep talking about her all the time?

353
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,700
Now keep quiet.
Let me alone!

354
00:32:15,911 --> 00:32:17,520
Now sit down!

355
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:46,358
- Hey, Ollie...
- If you don't stop bothering me,
I'm going to punch you in the nose.

356
00:32:47,775 --> 00:32:50,666
Didn't I tell you... to quit that?

357
00:33:00,448 --> 00:33:02,467
You'll hear about this later!

358
00:33:19,813 --> 00:33:20,554
Hey lads.

359
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:22,617
When you get through with that washing...

360
00:33:22,829 --> 00:33:24,603
the cook wants you to manicure
them vegetables...

361
00:33:24,811 --> 00:33:26,292
for tomorrow's stew.

362
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,162
I beg your pardon?

363
00:33:27,537 --> 00:33:28,982
You heard.

364
00:33:31,255 --> 00:33:33,555
Well, can you beat that?
How does he think that we're gonna...

365
00:33:33,688 --> 00:33:37,608
- Stanley, I feel something coming over me.
- You do?

366
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:42,602
A miracle has happened.

367
00:33:42,815 --> 00:33:44,707
- What?
- I've completely forgotten.

368
00:33:45,293 --> 00:33:48,547
- You mean you've forgotten Georgette?
- Who is Georgette?

369
00:33:48,761 --> 00:33:51,917
Gee, that's swell!
Now we can finish the washing
and we can go home.

370
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:55,568
Finish nothing!
We are going now.

371
00:33:57,723 --> 00:34:00,612
Now you're talking!
Absolutely.

372
00:34:03,957 --> 00:34:05,355
And I found them asleep.

373
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:06,964
When I told them to go back to work...

374
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:09,611
they threw wet laundry in my face!

375
00:34:10,689 --> 00:34:11,922
Oh... they did, eh?

376
00:34:12,152 --> 00:34:15,366
I'll show them what it means
to disobey my orders!

377
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,329
- Goodbye... goodbye.
- Bye, bye.

378
00:34:20,806 --> 00:34:22,928
- Gee, I'm sure glad to get out of this joint.
- Me too.

379
00:34:23,038 --> 00:34:25,178
- Have you got everything?
- Uh-huh.

380
00:34:25,846 --> 00:34:28,084
Now we'll go to that commandant guy
and tell him we're through...

381
00:34:28,197 --> 00:34:30,499
and at the same time,
I'll give him a piece of my mind.

382
00:34:30,716 --> 00:34:33,606
I don't blame you.
3 cents a day, ha!

383
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,334
Left time!

384
00:34:36,001 --> 00:34:37,233
Left!

385
00:34:43,188 --> 00:34:46,193
- Turn out the guard
and place them both under arrest!
- Yes, sir!

386
00:34:59,415 --> 00:35:01,928
Say, what's a big idea
of keeping us waiting?

387
00:35:06,684 --> 00:35:08,326
- You know what? - What?
- He's not here.

388
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:09,692
Well, of course he's not here!

389
00:35:09,905 --> 00:35:12,958
- Well, let's go look for him.
- Look nothing. I'll leave him a note.

390
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:15,056
Oh, I wouldn't bother to leave him a note.

391
00:35:15,274 --> 00:35:16,752
Just leave him a P.S.

392
00:35:16,965 --> 00:35:18,693
Good enough for him.

393
00:35:50,618 --> 00:35:53,463
Now he can put that in his pipe
and smoke it.

394
00:35:53,881 --> 00:35:55,445
Maybe he doesn't smoke a pipe?

395
00:35:55,657 --> 00:35:57,350
Well, whatever he smokes.

396
00:35:57,558 --> 00:35:59,694
Well, you've gotta to be careful
about those things.

397
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,789
What did you say in the note, Ollie?

398
00:36:22,995 --> 00:36:26,997
I said plenty and if I could've spelled raspberry
I would have told him a lot more.

399
00:36:27,206 --> 00:36:30,177
- That will learn him.
3 cents a day. - Right!

400
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:54,411
Never during my army career have
I been so grossly insulted!

401
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:57,632
Just wait until I get my hands on them.

402
00:37:20,693 --> 00:37:21,615
Attention!

403
00:38:23,614 --> 00:38:29,392
<i>Shine on, shine on
harvest moon...</i>

404
00:38:29,603 --> 00:38:31,984
<i>up in the sky...</i>

405
00:38:32,533 --> 00:38:38,560
<i>I ain't have no loving
since January April...</i>

406
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:40,907
<i>June or July...</i>

407
00:38:41,164 --> 00:38:42,524
<i>Snow time...</i>

408
00:38:42,732 --> 00:38:48,547
<i>t'ain't no time to stay
outdoors and spoon...</i>

409
00:38:49,175 --> 00:38:57,176
<i>Shine on, shine on
harvest moon for me and my girl.</i>

410
00:39:31,882 --> 00:39:35,374
- I wonder what time the train
leaves for Paris?
- The sooner the better for me.

411
00:39:35,675 --> 00:39:37,397
Say, which way to the depot?

412
00:39:37,611 --> 00:39:39,445
- Just around the corner.
- Thank you. - Godbye.

413
00:39:43,709 --> 00:39:47,576
- Let no one pass through the gate
no matter what happens. - Yes, sir!

414
00:39:54,055 --> 00:39:55,204
Come on.

415
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:01,005
Say, we're not going to take a plane,
are we?

416
00:40:01,223 --> 00:40:02,991
Ha! I should say not.

417
00:40:16,346 --> 00:40:17,905
I wonder what keeps them up?

418
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:20,835
I don't know but I know
what keeps me down.

419
00:40:22,236 --> 00:40:25,613
Me too.
Good old terracotta for me anytime.

420
00:40:26,069 --> 00:40:27,463
"Tomesceously".

421
00:40:39,949 --> 00:40:41,618
Georgette, darling.

422
00:40:43,911 --> 00:40:46,831
Now I'm so happy.
At last I'm here with you.

423
00:40:47,043 --> 00:40:49,305
- Have you missed you?
- Every day has been a year, darling.

424
00:40:49,515 --> 00:40:51,397
I'll bring the car for you.
You wait here just a moment.

425
00:40:57,222 --> 00:40:59,439
Could you tell us
the way to railroad depot?

426
00:41:01,135 --> 00:41:03,924
- Mr. Hardy!
- Georgette!

427
00:41:04,368 --> 00:41:06,531
So, you've changed your mind?

428
00:41:06,741 --> 00:41:09,823
Darling, I forgive you everything!

429
00:41:10,118 --> 00:41:12,088
Say, I though you said
you'd forgotten her.

430
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:16,089
Don't be silly! How could I forget
my little Georgette?

431
00:41:17,231 --> 00:41:18,497
Oh, Monsieur, I...

432
00:41:18,587 --> 00:41:19,748
I understand.

433
00:41:19,863 --> 00:41:21,854
- Stanley... We wish to be alone.
- Come on.

434
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,818
Come on, go on...

435
00:41:43,331 --> 00:41:45,264
Please, please.
Mr. Hardy!

436
00:41:46,051 --> 00:41:47,491
What's the big idea?

437
00:41:47,698 --> 00:41:49,833
The idea is that this lady
happens to be my wife.

438
00:41:50,047 --> 00:41:51,405
Oh, is that so?

439
00:41:52,233 --> 00:41:53,380
Your wife?

440
00:41:53,591 --> 00:41:55,606
Yes, you would be home wrecker!

441
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,918
François, please don't hit him.
He wouldn't understand.

442
00:41:58,125 --> 00:42:00,585
Honey, step into the car.
I want to speak to this gentleman alone.

443
00:42:04,017 --> 00:42:05,905
Now once more I'm going to give you
a piece of advice.

444
00:42:06,118 --> 00:42:07,676
Keep away from my wife.

445
00:42:07,891 --> 00:42:11,219
If I ever see or hear of you
being in her presence again...

446
00:42:11,433 --> 00:42:15,548
I'll see to it that your worthless carcass
lies sizzling in the desert sun...

447
00:42:15,761 --> 00:42:18,725
at the mercy of the vultures.
You understand?

448
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:19,851
Yes, sir.

449
00:42:21,365 --> 00:42:22,553
Yes, sir.

450
00:42:29,027 --> 00:42:32,528
Hey, mister, you don't have to worry
about us. We are leaving right now.

451
00:42:32,736 --> 00:42:35,467
- Aren't we Ollie?
- We certainly are! - Yes, sir.

452
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:36,853
Fall in!

453
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:38,872
Who's he talking to?

454
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,379
Fall in!

455
00:42:40,648 --> 00:42:43,403
What do you mean "Fall in"?
We're through. Didn't you get our note?

456
00:42:43,616 --> 00:42:47,483
Yes, I got your note and when you signed it,
you signed your own death warrant.

457
00:42:47,697 --> 00:42:50,660
You're under arrest for desertion.
Now fall in!

458
00:42:52,887 --> 00:42:55,886
- Call them at the jail and have the guard
to keep a close watch on them. - Yes, sir!

459
00:42:56,597 --> 00:42:58,200
Fall in, march!

460
00:43:05,923 --> 00:43:08,665
Halt!
Two deserters.

461
00:43:10,243 --> 00:43:13,679
Deserters, eh?
Come on, I'll show you to your suite.

462
00:43:18,674 --> 00:43:20,289
Get in.

463
00:43:20,748 --> 00:43:22,067
Hey, come on...

464
00:43:24,899 --> 00:43:26,057
Don't push me.

465
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,721
Revolution, eh?

466
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:35,602
I'll see you at sunrise.

467
00:43:35,902 --> 00:43:39,799
I'll learn them. I'll show them
where they get off at.

468
00:43:41,217 --> 00:43:43,909
- But what did we do?
- What did you do?

469
00:43:44,136 --> 00:43:44,952
Why you...

470
00:43:50,722 --> 00:43:52,129
Get in there!

471
00:43:56,039 --> 00:43:58,023
- Hey, mister?
- What?

472
00:43:58,696 --> 00:44:00,644
You forgot your key. Look.

473
00:44:05,131 --> 00:44:07,031
Why don't you keep your mouth shut?

474
00:44:40,463 --> 00:44:42,494
The prisoners have been found guilty...

475
00:44:42,705 --> 00:44:44,903
and will be shot at sunrise.

476
00:44:50,428 --> 00:44:54,278
Here's a nice pickle we're in.
Shot at sunrise.

477
00:44:55,243 --> 00:44:57,192
I hope it's cloudy tomorrow.

478
00:44:57,527 --> 00:44:58,801
- Say, Ollie.
- What?

479
00:44:59,022 --> 00:45:00,923
Do you still want to come back
as a horse?

480
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:03,666
I don't care if I never come back.

481
00:47:01,586 --> 00:47:03,037
I'll play you another one now.

482
00:47:03,247 --> 00:47:04,484
Shut up!

483
00:47:06,237 --> 00:47:07,474
Go to sleep!

484
00:47:43,063 --> 00:47:44,928
Put that thing down!

485
00:48:15,718 --> 00:48:17,485
Well, I guess we better get some sleep.

486
00:48:24,816 --> 00:48:26,290
- What?
- Get in there.

487
00:48:26,504 --> 00:48:29,090
- What for?
- Shh... never mind what for. Hurry up.

488
00:48:32,101 --> 00:48:33,494
Come on, get in.

489
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,129
You could let the fellow know...

490
00:48:36,341 --> 00:48:38,880
Here, take this candle.

491
00:49:00,297 --> 00:49:01,900
Say, where are we going?

492
00:49:02,109 --> 00:49:04,648
This tunnel leads to the outside wall.

493
00:49:04,866 --> 00:49:06,586
We're making our escape.

494
00:49:07,996 --> 00:49:09,597
Are we allowed to do that?

495
00:49:11,041 --> 00:49:12,188
Go ahead!

496
00:49:15,032 --> 00:49:16,836
"Are we allowed to do that?"

497
00:49:21,785 --> 00:49:24,780
In this fog...
I just don't know where we are.

498
00:49:25,077 --> 00:49:28,729
It sure is, I'm dying with laugher.

499
00:49:28,625 --> 00:49:30,585
- Go ahead!
- Don't you hit me!

500
00:49:36,185 --> 00:49:37,577
See what you've done?

501
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:39,884
Now we've got to dig our way out.

502
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,594
Go back to the cell
and get those tin plates.

503
00:49:43,964 --> 00:49:45,276
I don't want to go back to the cell.

504
00:49:45,488 --> 00:49:48,027
Will you hurry?
This is our last chance.

505
00:49:49,315 --> 00:49:51,740
Why do I always have to do everything?

506
00:49:55,285 --> 00:49:56,677
Always me, me, me...

507
00:49:59,482 --> 00:50:00,875
Put your head down.

508
00:50:01,459 --> 00:50:03,015
Never you, you...

509
00:50:19,887 --> 00:50:21,037
- Bring the prisoners!
- Yes, sir!

510
00:50:27,275 --> 00:50:30,278
All right, come on you. The sun's up.
Come on.

511
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:37,341
- They're gone! Escaped!
- What?

512
00:50:39,613 --> 00:50:40,797
Give me the Commandant!

513
00:50:45,886 --> 00:50:48,527
Sir! The prisoners have escaped.

514
00:50:49,228 --> 00:50:52,726
What? The prisoners have escaped?
Than find them!

515
00:50:52,942 --> 00:50:54,175
Yes, sir!

516
00:50:56,055 --> 00:50:58,894
I want both of those prisoners
brought back, dead or alive.

517
00:50:59,004 --> 00:51:01,373
Call out the entire post, if necessary.

518
00:51:02,631 --> 00:51:04,420
I wonder what time it is?

519
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:06,446
Now how do I know?

520
00:51:07,271 --> 00:51:09,905
We should be beyond the wall by now.

521
00:51:10,494 --> 00:51:13,006
- Seems like we've been working...
- I guess you're right.

522
00:51:13,465 --> 00:51:15,978
- We better start digging up.
- That's a good idea.

523
00:51:23,633 --> 00:51:26,310
Oh, stop all this nonsense now.

524
00:51:26,771 --> 00:51:29,611
- Don't you dare go back to Paris again
and leave me alone. - Darling.

525
00:51:34,282 --> 00:51:38,348
- Oh, uh, bring up a bottle of that special
vintage wine from the cellar, will you?
- Yes, sir.

526
00:51:45,588 --> 00:51:47,067
Will you get out of here!

527
00:51:47,529 --> 00:51:51,027
I'm trying to get dressed.
You're starting to annoy me. Now go!

528
00:52:34,904 --> 00:52:36,674
I wonder where we are.

529
00:52:36,885 --> 00:52:39,170
Maybe some saloon outside the fort.

530
00:52:46,374 --> 00:52:47,983
See if the coast is clear.

531
00:52:48,192 --> 00:52:50,292
I don't want to see
if the coast is clear.

532
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:55,738
Go ahead.

533
00:53:03,378 --> 00:53:04,528
Maybe someone is...

534
00:53:30,408 --> 00:53:33,049
Troops, pay attention!
Make a search straight for the barracks!

535
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:43,412
Georgette, may I come in?

536
00:53:57,384 --> 00:53:58,571
- Georgette.
- <i>Yes, dear!</i>

537
00:53:58,916 --> 00:53:59,938
<i>Are you all right?</i>

538
00:54:00,155 --> 00:54:02,045
<i>Yes, fine.</i>

539
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:50,810
At a time like this,
you had to do that.

540
00:54:53,259 --> 00:54:54,984
Quick. Help me get her on the bed!

541
00:54:58,547 --> 00:54:59,910
Get her feet.

542
00:55:08,052 --> 00:55:09,993
Quick, get me a glass of water!

543
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:30,532
Look out.

544
00:55:36,649 --> 00:55:38,096
Don't do that!

545
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,064
What is the meaning of this?

546
00:55:41,982 --> 00:55:43,003
What will we say?

547
00:55:43,222 --> 00:55:45,653
You think up your story.
I've got mine.

548
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,421
Now pay strict attention all of you!

549
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:16,984
The men who were to be shot
this morning have escaped.

550
00:56:17,194 --> 00:56:20,209
Make sure all gates are closed
and make a thorough search
of the entire barracks.

551
00:56:20,233 --> 00:56:21,204
Whoever brings them back...

552
00:56:21,213 --> 00:56:23,879
will be given a reward
of six weeks furlough.
That's all.

553
00:58:56,602 --> 00:58:58,057
Let's cover up the hole.

554
01:00:35,797 --> 01:00:38,721
- Hey. - What?
- See if they've gone?

555
01:00:46,516 --> 01:00:47,927
Yeah, we've given them the slip.

556
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:50,010
Good. Now let's get out of here.

557
01:07:07,822 --> 01:07:10,355
Hey, Stan. Look!

558
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:11,853
I'm over here!

559
01:07:15,522 --> 01:07:18,437
Well, here's another nice mess
you've gotten me into.

560
01:07:23,641 --> 01:07:25,595
Ollie, is that really you?

561
01:07:26,014 --> 01:07:27,291
Of course, it's me.

562
01:07:27,513 --> 01:07:29,634
Gee, I'm glad to see you.
