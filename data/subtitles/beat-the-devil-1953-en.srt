1
00:01:40,952 --> 00:01:43,453
<i>These are
four brilliant criminals</i>

2
00:01:43,486 --> 00:01:46,219
<i>at the climax of
their most magnificent effort.</i>

3
00:01:49,988 --> 00:01:52,955
<i>This effort began
six months ago in Portoverto,</i>

4
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:55,356
<i>where we were all
to board the ship for Africa,</i>

5
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:59,156
<i>and they were my... associates
in a quest for uranium,</i>

6
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,490
<i>an element not one of them
knew the first thing about,</i>

7
00:02:01,724 --> 00:02:04,025
<i>except that they'd heard
you could get dough for it.</i>

8
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:06,058
<i>Big dough.</i>

9
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,859
Who are-? I mean,
what do you suppose they are?

10
00:02:08,892 --> 00:02:10,526
Businessmen.
Does it matter?

11
00:02:10,827 --> 00:02:12,627
Well, if we're going to be
on a small boat with them

12
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,927
for weeks and weeks.

13
00:02:14,226 --> 00:02:16,461
I only said they might be
fellow passengers.

14
00:02:16,494 --> 00:02:18,462
Harry, we must beware
of those men.

15
00:02:18,495 --> 00:02:19,996
They're desperate characters.

16
00:02:20,029 --> 00:02:21,295
What makes you say that?

17
00:02:21,462 --> 00:02:23,529
Not one of them looked
at my legs.

18
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,765
Good morning, Mrs. Dannreuther.

19
00:02:29,798 --> 00:02:30,932
Good morning, Billy-Boy.

20
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:32,398
Care to join us
in a stroll?

21
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:33,398
Stir up the liver,

22
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:34,666
sweat out the toxins.

23
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:36,466
Help nature to help you.

24
00:02:36,499 --> 00:02:37,767
Wouldn't dream of it.

25
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,301
Really, Billy,
you mustn't be so offhand

26
00:02:42,334 --> 00:02:43,701
with Mr. Peterson.

27
00:02:44,035 --> 00:02:45,936
If I were to treat him with more
than common politeness,

28
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:48,769
he'd misunderstand
and try to push me around.

29
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:51,070
Mr. Peterson is a bully.

30
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,337
- Billy, did you see this?
- Huh?

31
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:56,805
That man in London
has been killed.

32
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:58,672
What man?

33
00:02:58,705 --> 00:03:00,006
"Paul Vanmeer,

34
00:03:00,238 --> 00:03:02,373
"a high-ranking official
in the Colonial Office,

35
00:03:02,406 --> 00:03:04,641
"was stabbed to death
early this morning

36
00:03:04,674 --> 00:03:08,074
"by an unknown assailant
outside a club in Soho.

37
00:03:08,108 --> 00:03:09,808
"This is the third crime
of violence

38
00:03:09,842 --> 00:03:11,075
"to occur in that vicinity

39
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:13,110
within the past month".

40
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:17,477
What is it, Billy?

41
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,014
In heaven's name, Billy,
say something.

42
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,317
You understand, of course,
that Peterson arranged this.

43
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,684
It seems there's been a lot

44
00:03:45,717 --> 00:03:47,085
of violence around there lately.

45
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,351
Oh, don't pretend to be a fool.

46
00:03:48,385 --> 00:03:49,551
But look, Billy,

47
00:03:49,685 --> 00:03:51,252
this happened
early Tuesday morning.

48
00:03:51,285 --> 00:03:53,419
We'd all left London
well before that.

49
00:03:53,452 --> 00:03:56,286
What about Jack Ross?
What about the Galloping Major?

50
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,387
But he only-

51
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,955
I thought he only stayed behind

52
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,022
to get that phone call
from Mombasa.

53
00:04:01,055 --> 00:04:03,822
If it came through,
he'll be here this morning.

54
00:04:03,856 --> 00:04:05,155
Well?

55
00:04:05,188 --> 00:04:06,923
Don't get so excited.

56
00:04:06,957 --> 00:04:09,423
Don't jump
to unpleasant conclusions.

57
00:04:09,456 --> 00:04:11,257
Jump? They might as well
have drawn a map.

58
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,524
Why was Peterson worried
about Vanmeer?

59
00:04:13,557 --> 00:04:15,191
What made him think
he was dangerous?

60
00:04:15,492 --> 00:04:17,993
He was afraid Vanmeer
wouldn't stay bought.

61
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:21,159
He was afraid he'd get
the wind up after we'd gone.

62
00:04:21,192 --> 00:04:23,128
He had visions
of him trotting upstairs

63
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,193
to his superiors
and announcing,

64
00:04:25,227 --> 00:04:27,361
"I have certain information
that certain persons

65
00:04:27,395 --> 00:04:28,862
are paid certain sums
of money-"

66
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:30,262
Don't talk so loud, Billy.

67
00:04:30,263 --> 00:04:32,996
"- to obtain illegal rights
to certain mineral supplies".

68
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,563
That Indian-
That rajah or whatever he was.

69
00:04:35,597 --> 00:04:37,498
- that you worked
for in the old days.

70
00:04:37,531 --> 00:04:39,098
He killed a lot of people,
didn't he?

71
00:04:39,132 --> 00:04:41,165
Ah, but he had a better style.

72
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,099
Besides,
he was out for a kingdom

73
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:45,000
half the size of France.

74
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:48,000
What's the difference between
that and millions of dollars?

75
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:50,234
We must think
of the future, Billy.

76
00:04:50,267 --> 00:04:51,601
This is our big chance.

77
00:04:51,634 --> 00:04:53,069
It may be our last.

78
00:04:53,102 --> 00:04:54,602
Except for Mr. Peterson,

79
00:04:54,635 --> 00:04:57,403
we couldn't even pay
last night's hotel bill.

80
00:04:57,436 --> 00:04:58,636
Where are you going?

81
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,970
I'm going down to the café,

82
00:05:00,302 --> 00:05:01,671
drink a lot of Pernod,
listen to the band.

83
00:05:01,704 --> 00:05:03,170
You won't make a fuss,
will you?

84
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:04,571
It doesn't do
to make a fuss.

85
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,838
You have to think
of the main objective.

86
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,141
Naturally,
it doesn't do to be fussy.

87
00:05:19,508 --> 00:05:21,342
It's your move,
Gwendolen.

88
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,842
Gracias.

89
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,982
The luggage is in there.

90
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,282
Bring it up.

91
00:05:56,618 --> 00:05:58,085
Harry, look.
The desperadoes.

92
00:05:58,118 --> 00:05:59,153
Shh.

93
00:06:01,252 --> 00:06:02,653
Not quite
in our contract, Billy.

94
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:04,219
Hard liquor before noon.

95
00:06:04,253 --> 00:06:05,386
I'm celebrating.

96
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,521
Celebrating what?

97
00:06:06,554 --> 00:06:08,088
The safe arrival of the major.

98
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:09,621
He came galloping
in a minute ago,

99
00:06:09,754 --> 00:06:11,455
looking tired
but satisfied.

100
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,389
I take it his mission
was accomplished.

101
00:06:16,423 --> 00:06:18,724
Yes. Well, it's getting on
for lunchtime, gentlemen.

102
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:20,424
I'll see you later, Billy.

103
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,459
Your move, Gwendolen.

104
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:28,693
Gwendolen,
it's your move.

105
00:06:28,726 --> 00:06:30,226
Oh.

106
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,226
Check.

107
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,727
Blast.

108
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,695
Are you sailing
on the Nyanga?

109
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,929
- Africa-bound.
- So are we.

110
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:39,729
Oh, my name is Chelm.
This is my wife.

111
00:06:39,862 --> 00:06:41,229
How do you do?
My name is Dannreuther.

112
00:06:41,263 --> 00:06:42,430
How do you do?

113
00:06:42,463 --> 00:06:43,997
Are your friends
sailing too?

114
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,798
The whole kit and caboodle.

115
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:48,565
You're a very mysterious group,
I must say.

116
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:49,532
Really, Gwendolen.

117
00:06:49,565 --> 00:06:51,298
How so mysterious?

118
00:06:51,331 --> 00:06:53,900
Well, for one thing
you all appear

119
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:56,100
to be of different
nationalities.

120
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:57,634
It's your move,
Gwendolen.

121
00:06:58,567 --> 00:06:59,534
Check.

122
00:07:01,102 --> 00:07:02,935
I have a theory about you
and your friends.

123
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:05,402
Correction. My associates.

124
00:07:06,202 --> 00:07:07,870
As a matter of fact,

125
00:07:07,904 --> 00:07:09,670
I think you're doctors.

126
00:07:09,704 --> 00:07:11,370
Evil ones, I mean.

127
00:07:11,403 --> 00:07:13,105
You're going
to the heart of the jungle,

128
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:16,439
where human life is cheap,
to perform ghastly experiments

129
00:07:16,472 --> 00:07:18,338
which require
the sacrifice of thousands

130
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:20,640
on the altar of science.

131
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:21,707
You must excuse my wife,

132
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:23,641
she has
a very lively imagination.

133
00:07:26,741 --> 00:07:28,142
Checkmate.

134
00:07:28,176 --> 00:07:30,142
I don't know how you expect me
to play a decent game

135
00:07:30,176 --> 00:07:32,643
when you keep talking
all the time.

136
00:07:32,676 --> 00:07:34,843
Harry's been
all out of sorts today.

137
00:07:34,877 --> 00:07:36,811
Usually
he's a wonderful loser.

138
00:07:36,844 --> 00:07:38,510
Good morning, Mr. Dannreuther.

139
00:07:38,544 --> 00:07:40,678
I bring you
the captain's compliments,

140
00:07:40,712 --> 00:07:42,579
along with the sad news
that the sailing

141
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:45,412
of the S.S. Nyanga
has been postponed.

142
00:07:45,446 --> 00:07:47,280
Now, look here.
This boat is definitely,

143
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,280
most definitely scheduled
to sail at 2400 hours.

144
00:07:50,314 --> 00:07:51,881
Scheduled, Mr. Chelm,

145
00:07:51,915 --> 00:07:54,449
but not, I fear,
destined to do so.

146
00:07:54,482 --> 00:07:56,348
Propeller gone
or is the captain drunk?

147
00:07:56,382 --> 00:07:58,117
Oh, of course the captain
is drunk,

148
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,983
but the real trouble
is with the oil pump.

149
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:01,316
Well, it's not good enough.

150
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:02,484
Simply not good enough.

151
00:08:02,517 --> 00:08:03,718
Quite right, sir.

152
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,185
But you're putting it
too mildly.

153
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:06,885
The present oil pump
is no good at all.

154
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:08,652
How much delay
does this mean?

155
00:08:08,685 --> 00:08:10,586
Oh, to locate, bargain for,

156
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:13,487
purchase and install a new one
will require, I should say,

157
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,854
more than a day,
less than a fortnight.

158
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:20,022
Utter hopeless inefficiency.

159
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:21,823
Probably it isn't
the oil pump at all.

160
00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:23,723
Just making it an excuse
to hang about

161
00:08:23,756 --> 00:08:25,223
and pick up extra cargo.

162
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:26,824
Guns or opium?

163
00:08:26,957 --> 00:08:29,192
I wouldn't be surprised if
she turns out to be a smuggler.

164
00:08:29,224 --> 00:08:31,092
What a miserable place
to be stuck in.

165
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,625
A squalid fifth-rate port.

166
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,625
Ever been in Portoverto before?

167
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,927
No, I don't know this part
of the world at all.

168
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,094
I thought not. Otherwise
you wouldn't be so upset

169
00:08:40,127 --> 00:08:41,128
about staying.

170
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:43,028
Magnificent country.

171
00:08:43,061 --> 00:08:44,795
Ruins to visit by moonlight.

172
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:46,295
Fine stretch of beach.

173
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:47,562
And back there in the hills,

174
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:50,396
one of the few spots left
in the world

175
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,397
where you can get
decent food and drink.

176
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,530
It's called the Blue Pavilion.

177
00:08:54,564 --> 00:08:56,331
I insist you give me
the pleasure

178
00:08:56,364 --> 00:08:58,065
of having dinner
with us tonight.

179
00:08:58,165 --> 00:08:59,832
Well, that's awfully kind
of you, but-

180
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:00,933
Us?

181
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,666
You and your associates?

182
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:04,433
My wife and me.

183
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:05,834
The Committee.

184
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:07,500
Oh, uh, Mr. Chelm, I-

185
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:09,168
I want you to meet
a friend of mine.

186
00:09:09,202 --> 00:09:10,868
This is the Galloping Major.

187
00:09:10,901 --> 00:09:12,635
The Committee wants you
to toddle 'round.

188
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:14,736
- Okay.
- Right away.

189
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:16,269
- I'll be along.
- Toddle.

190
00:09:16,303 --> 00:09:17,503
I said I'd be along.

191
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,704
They don't like
to be kept waiting.

192
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:21,938
I'll lay on a car.

193
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:24,371
We'll meet in front
of the hotel at 6.

194
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:26,139
Arrivederci.

195
00:09:28,673 --> 00:09:31,941
Dannreuther, an American,
I suppose.

196
00:09:31,974 --> 00:09:34,875
Anyway, I-
I quite like him.

197
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,742
Time, 24 hours in a day.

198
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:38,876
One-thousand-four-hundred
and forty minutes

199
00:09:39,043 --> 00:09:41,776
for somebody else to get busy
on the same idea as ours.

200
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:43,777
We ought to have got a plane
and flown out,

201
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,211
as I said from the start.

202
00:09:45,243 --> 00:09:46,978
You remember I said it,
O'Horror.

203
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:48,444
My name is not O'Horror.

204
00:09:48,478 --> 00:09:50,746
It is O'Hara. You hear?
Mr. O'Hara.

205
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:53,445
Yes, Mr. O'Horror, ahem,
but you remember I said it.

206
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:55,246
I said we ought
to take a plane.

207
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,180
Time. Time. What is time?

208
00:09:57,214 --> 00:09:59,781
The Swiss manufacture it.
The French hoard it.

209
00:09:59,814 --> 00:10:02,648
The Italians squander it.
Americans say it is money.

210
00:10:02,682 --> 00:10:04,381
Hindus say it does not exist.

211
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,916
You know what I say?
I say time is a crook.

212
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,984
If we took a plane,
we'd be there inside 15 hours

213
00:10:10,017 --> 00:10:11,283
instead of who knows when.

214
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:12,951
I don't want any more talk
about flying.

215
00:10:12,984 --> 00:10:14,085
The sky is for the birds.

216
00:10:14,518 --> 00:10:16,618
My feet are on the ground,
both of them.

217
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,319
Come in, Billy-Boy.

218
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,420
What's all
the fuss about?

219
00:10:23,453 --> 00:10:24,787
No fuss, Billy.

220
00:10:24,955 --> 00:10:26,721
We're merely wondering
what course to pursue

221
00:10:26,755 --> 00:10:28,789
in view of this
unfortunate delay.

222
00:10:28,822 --> 00:10:30,455
Join the peasants
in their revels.

223
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:32,656
Go to church.
Write your memoirs.

224
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,990
Very funny. Ha-ha.

225
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:38,524
I like an associate of mine
to have a sense of humor.

226
00:10:38,557 --> 00:10:40,859
A good laugh does more
for the stomach muscles

227
00:10:40,892 --> 00:10:42,859
than five minutes
setting up exercises.

228
00:10:45,493 --> 00:10:47,227
And now that we've had
our moment of fun

229
00:10:47,793 --> 00:10:49,894
and all the better for it,
let's get back to the question.

230
00:10:49,927 --> 00:10:51,794
Doesn't this delay call
for a cable

231
00:10:51,827 --> 00:10:53,428
to your friend
in British East?

232
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:54,528
Mustn't send cables.

233
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,029
Can't you get it
through your heads

234
00:10:56,496 --> 00:10:58,196
that the population down there
has trained noses?

235
00:10:58,395 --> 00:11:01,530
They can smell a uranium deal
like a cat smells fish.

236
00:11:01,563 --> 00:11:03,330
But aren't you afraid,
Billy,

237
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,132
that when our little party
doesn't show up

238
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,798
on the date you said-

239
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:08,365
Aren't you a teeny bit afraid

240
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:10,732
that your friend
might use that as an excuse

241
00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:12,833
to begin negotiations elsewhere?

242
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:16,400
If my friend were looking
for an excuse,

243
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:18,334
he'd find a better one
in the morning papers.

244
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:20,169
What do you mean?

245
00:11:20,202 --> 00:11:23,603
I'm talking about the
untimely demise of Paul Vanmeer.

246
00:11:27,238 --> 00:11:29,470
Well, I'm appalled, Billy.

247
00:11:29,504 --> 00:11:31,438
What an unwholesome opinion
you must have

248
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:33,772
of your colleagues
to imagine that we-

249
00:11:33,805 --> 00:11:36,506
Look here, Peterson. You don't
have to convince me of anything.

250
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:38,406
You don't care
what I think as long as I don't

251
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,807
do anything about it.

252
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,607
And I won't
unless you ever decide

253
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,775
to sic that knife-happy
little junkie on me.

254
00:11:43,808 --> 00:11:45,841
Watch yourself, laddie.

255
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,709
Now, Jack, behave yourself.

256
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:49,810
Sit down.

257
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,144
For shame, Billy.

258
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:56,344
I think you owe an apology
to everybody in this room,

259
00:11:56,377 --> 00:11:59,079
and if you're half
the gentleman I know you are,

260
00:11:59,112 --> 00:12:00,645
I'm sure you'll make it.

261
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,780
As I was saying,
you have nothing to worry about.

262
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:05,247
My friend won't pull out
unless I tell him to,

263
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,847
and for purely venal reasons,

264
00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:09,081
that's the last thing
I have in mind.

265
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:12,548
Jack, give Billy a light.

266
00:12:23,218 --> 00:12:25,352
What a wonderful car.

267
00:12:25,385 --> 00:12:27,519
It looks as if it had won
the Grand Prix d'Elegance

268
00:12:27,552 --> 00:12:29,520
many years ago.
- Oh, it did.

269
00:12:29,553 --> 00:12:31,787
It was built for Oriposo.
You know, the bullfighter.

270
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,821
He had it made this way

271
00:12:33,188 --> 00:12:34,420
so he could stand up
and take bows.

272
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:35,621
He only got one ride in it.

273
00:12:36,054 --> 00:12:37,222
He bequeathed it
to me on his deathbed.

274
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:39,889
Well, here's to Oriposo.
I hope you like champagne.

275
00:12:39,922 --> 00:12:41,556
You mean, it's yours?

276
00:12:41,723 --> 00:12:44,191
Gave it to my former chauffeur,
the fat bandit in the front.

277
00:12:44,224 --> 00:12:46,524
Harry, look
at that wonderful villa.

278
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,259
Oh, that was Bertie Crampton's.

279
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:51,391
Oh, you mean, Lord Crampton
in Gloucestershire. Heh.

280
00:12:51,424 --> 00:12:54,559
His family acres marched
hand in hand with ours.

281
00:12:54,592 --> 00:12:55,860
Gloucestershire,

282
00:12:55,894 --> 00:12:58,727
the cathedral towns,
trout fishing,

283
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,128
garden parties-

284
00:13:00,162 --> 00:13:01,895
What a beautiful life.

285
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:03,495
You know England well?

286
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:06,129
Emotionally,
I am English.

287
00:13:06,163 --> 00:13:09,429
I serve tea every afternoon
with crumpets.

288
00:13:09,463 --> 00:13:11,931
And I've always kept up
my subscription

289
00:13:11,964 --> 00:13:13,031
to Country Life

290
00:13:13,064 --> 00:13:14,531
and to Tattler.

291
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,032
The trouble with England, it's
all pomp and no circumstance.

292
00:13:17,065 --> 00:13:19,366
You're very wise to get
out of it. Escape while you can.

293
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,833
Well, I'd hardly
describe myself as escaping.

294
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:24,467
It so happened that a relative
of mine, first cousin actually,

295
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,002
who died recently, happened
to own a coffee plantation.

296
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:28,434
Africa's the place now.

297
00:13:28,802 --> 00:13:30,636
You talk about the diamond boys,
the gold boys.

298
00:13:30,669 --> 00:13:32,669
They've just skimmed
a little off the top.

299
00:13:32,702 --> 00:13:34,370
The potential mineral wealth
of Africa

300
00:13:34,403 --> 00:13:35,770
has hardly been scratched.

301
00:13:35,804 --> 00:13:37,937
Now, there is a villa.

302
00:13:37,971 --> 00:13:39,638
Big.

303
00:13:39,805 --> 00:13:42,072
That's the Villa Capriccio,
famed in song and story.

304
00:13:42,106 --> 00:13:43,772
A three-star attraction
in Baedeker.

305
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:45,006
Well, whose is it?

306
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:46,640
The banks own it now.
Used to be mine.

307
00:13:46,673 --> 00:13:48,040
- Yours?
- Yes.

308
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:49,874
I brought old Charles over
from Fouquet's.

309
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,108
You know, the old Fouquet's,
to run it for me.

310
00:13:52,141 --> 00:13:53,809
Then when I decided
to pull up stakes,

311
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:55,608
I bought him this restaurant
we're going to.

312
00:13:55,642 --> 00:13:57,810
Least I could do
to show my appreciation.

313
00:13:57,843 --> 00:13:59,676
Well, here we are.

314
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:02,244
Charles!

315
00:14:02,377 --> 00:14:04,244
Wait here a minute
while I rout old Charles out.

316
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,179
He doesn't know
we're in this neck of the woods.

317
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,711
Charles!

318
00:14:08,745 --> 00:14:10,213
Heh.

319
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:12,345
He must think
we're extraordinarily naive.

320
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:13,747
Knew all those people.

321
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,647
Owned that vast villa.

322
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,481
Bought this place because
he liked the fellow's cooking.

323
00:14:18,514 --> 00:14:19,748
What utter balderdash.

324
00:14:19,781 --> 00:14:21,049
Well, perhaps he did.

325
00:14:21,082 --> 00:14:22,448
I beg leave to doubt it.

326
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:23,882
Did you notice his wife?

327
00:14:24,116 --> 00:14:25,983
She seemed to me rather
a sensitive little woman.

328
00:14:26,017 --> 00:14:28,017
Really embarrassed
by all that rot.

329
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,684
I'm sorry, signor,

330
00:14:29,717 --> 00:14:31,517
as you see, we are closed.

331
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:33,985
We do not open
for another two months.

332
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:37,386
Charles, what's going on here?
This place is falling to rack and ruin.

333
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,987
The placed is closed. We'll have
to dine in the hotel after all.

334
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:41,520
Monsieur Dann.

335
00:14:43,822 --> 00:14:47,289
Monsieur-
Monsieur Dann.

336
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:50,823
Madame. Why did you not let me
know you were coming?

337
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:54,257
You did not say you were
with Monsieur Dann. Heh-heh.

338
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,292
Nothing is closed
to Monsieur Dann.

339
00:14:56,324 --> 00:14:57,691
Good to see you again,
Charles.

340
00:14:57,925 --> 00:14:59,926
It's been too long,
Monsieur Dann.

341
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:02,993
Not since the night
you left the villa. Ha.

342
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,927
Remember your farewell party?

343
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,793
I've tried ever since
to forget it.

344
00:15:07,061 --> 00:15:09,394
Remember how in the morning
we escorted you

345
00:15:09,427 --> 00:15:12,662
to the train
with violins playing

346
00:15:12,695 --> 00:15:14,029
and everybody cried

347
00:15:14,062 --> 00:15:16,529
like when a king
you love very much

348
00:15:16,563 --> 00:15:17,963
leaves his country.

349
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,364
Aren't you dressed yet?

350
00:15:22,398 --> 00:15:24,098
Do I appear
to be dressed?

351
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,631
Do dress, do hurry.

352
00:15:25,665 --> 00:15:27,399
It's the most wonderful day,

353
00:15:27,432 --> 00:15:29,532
and Billy wants us to drive out
and see his villa.

354
00:15:29,566 --> 00:15:32,533
Uh, his former villa. Hm.

355
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:35,302
Obviously, I can't go.
I've got a chill on my liver.

356
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:39,502
What a miserable place
to be ill.

357
00:15:39,535 --> 00:15:42,003
And you forgot to pack
my hot water bottle.

358
00:15:42,037 --> 00:15:43,170
You packed it.

359
00:15:43,336 --> 00:15:44,703
Gwendolen,
I distinctly remember-

360
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:50,105
Hello.

361
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:51,772
Oh, hello.

362
00:15:51,805 --> 00:15:53,439
No, I-I'm afraid we can't.

363
00:15:53,472 --> 00:15:55,006
Harry has
this wretched chill and-

364
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,506
Uh, give me the telephone.

365
00:15:58,674 --> 00:16:00,241
Chelm here.

366
00:16:00,274 --> 00:16:02,242
Yes.

367
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:03,341
Quite.

368
00:16:03,374 --> 00:16:04,675
Absolutely.

369
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,509
A hot water bottle.

370
00:16:07,943 --> 00:16:11,044
That's very,
very good of you, old boy.

371
00:16:11,077 --> 00:16:12,410
Now, look here, Dannreuther,

372
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:15,411
would you mind very much
if my wife went alone?

373
00:16:15,444 --> 00:16:18,213
She enjoys this sightseeing sort
of stuff, you know.

374
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:20,280
Splendid.

375
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:22,080
Splendid.
I'll send her along.

376
00:16:26,215 --> 00:16:28,648
You know, Gwendolen, nowadays
one simply cannot afford

377
00:16:28,682 --> 00:16:32,283
to dismiss people just because
they're not one's sort.

378
00:16:32,317 --> 00:16:35,416
One has to try
and bridge the gulf.

379
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:37,951
After all, it's a new world
we're going into.

380
00:16:37,984 --> 00:16:40,118
One's got to take it
as one finds it.

381
00:16:40,152 --> 00:16:41,185
Face it.

382
00:16:41,219 --> 00:16:42,219
Use it.

383
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,351
Master it.

384
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:14,527
You know,
I- I've seen Americans

385
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,493
on the street and in the cinema,
of course, but I-

386
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:19,795
I've never talked
to one before.

387
00:17:19,828 --> 00:17:21,561
Are you a typical American?

388
00:17:21,595 --> 00:17:23,562
I think it's important
that I should know.

389
00:17:23,596 --> 00:17:25,096
Why important?

390
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,396
There are two good reasons
for falling in love.

391
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:32,065
One is that the object
of your affections

392
00:17:32,098 --> 00:17:33,899
is unlike anyone else.

393
00:17:33,932 --> 00:17:37,166
A rare spirit,
such as Lord Byron.

394
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:39,666
The other is that
he's like everybody else,

395
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,467
only superior.

396
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,168
Harry, for instance,
is the very best of a type.

397
00:17:44,201 --> 00:17:47,602
Well, if you must know,
I'm a typical rare spirit.

398
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:49,070
How long did you live here?

399
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:52,270
Oh, the longest I've ever
lived anywhere is two years.

400
00:17:52,303 --> 00:17:53,871
But when you were a child,

401
00:17:54,071 --> 00:17:56,171
didn't you ever have a mother
and father and a house

402
00:17:56,204 --> 00:17:57,805
and a street and a town?

403
00:17:57,838 --> 00:18:00,205
No. I, uh- I was an orphan
until I was 20,

404
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:02,973
and then a rich
and beautiful lady adopted me.

405
00:18:03,006 --> 00:18:05,307
Heh. You know,
I've changed my mind

406
00:18:05,341 --> 00:18:08,074
about your being
an evil doctor.

407
00:18:08,107 --> 00:18:10,175
You're off to keep
a rendezvous some place

408
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,009
in Africa sacred
to the tribesmen.

409
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:15,276
You're going
to found a new empire

410
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:19,010
and make yourself master
of the riches of the world,

411
00:18:19,043 --> 00:18:20,844
but you need
a beautiful blond queen

412
00:18:20,878 --> 00:18:22,744
to impress the natives as-

413
00:18:22,777 --> 00:18:26,246
A- as the incarnation
of the queen of Sheba.

414
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,546
That's why you're making
a pass at me.

415
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:29,913
Am I?

416
00:18:29,946 --> 00:18:31,647
Of course.

417
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,014
I don't generally go sightseeing
with strange men.

418
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,815
You don't believe that,
do you?

419
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:39,182
Oh, I believe anything you say.

420
00:18:39,215 --> 00:18:41,415
- Do you?
- Mm-hm.

421
00:18:41,449 --> 00:18:44,117
Well, you shouldn't, you know.
You really shouldn't.

422
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,884
Mr. Chelm.

423
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,085
Yes?

424
00:18:47,118 --> 00:18:50,285
It is I, Mrs. Dannreuther.
Maria.

425
00:18:50,318 --> 00:18:51,319
Oh, come on.

426
00:18:53,385 --> 00:18:55,020
Tea for two and two for tea.

427
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,486
Now, that's most awfully kind.

428
00:18:57,753 --> 00:18:59,255
You shouldn't
have troubled. Really.

429
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:01,821
Billy told me you had a chill.

430
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:03,588
Bit of one. On the liver.
Too tiresome.

431
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:05,488
- Milk, of course.
- Of course.

432
00:19:09,756 --> 00:19:11,690
I feel I should like somehow

433
00:19:11,724 --> 00:19:13,724
to do him a good turn
of some kind.

434
00:19:13,757 --> 00:19:14,925
You do?

435
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:15,925
Well, naturally.

436
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,626
Oh, I see, naturally.

437
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,759
I think it would be nice if-

438
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,327
If you were able
to do something for him.

439
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:24,693
Help him along.

440
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:26,694
Give him the benefit
of your advice.

441
00:19:26,728 --> 00:19:29,362
Delighted, of course.
For instance?

442
00:19:29,394 --> 00:19:32,129
Oh, something with business.

443
00:19:32,162 --> 00:19:34,097
He was very pleased
with that tip you gave him

444
00:19:34,264 --> 00:19:36,163
on the way home last night
about the gold shares.

445
00:19:36,197 --> 00:19:38,331
I've forgotten what I told him.
What was it?

446
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:41,932
I don't remember either.

447
00:19:41,965 --> 00:19:43,732
I was listening to your voice.

448
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,833
I wasn't listening
to what you said.

449
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:51,034
<i>You see,
if you were helping him,</i>

450
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:52,533
it would be so much easier

451
00:19:52,835 --> 00:19:54,701
for us to be together
a lot out there in Africa.

452
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,636
Well, has he any head
for business?

453
00:19:56,669 --> 00:19:58,636
Why, he's simply brilliant.

454
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:00,370
I wouldn't have thought it.

455
00:20:00,403 --> 00:20:03,070
But of course he is.

456
00:20:03,104 --> 00:20:05,938
You don't suppose
I'd marry a ninny, do you?

457
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,272
If you imagine that Harry

458
00:20:07,537 --> 00:20:09,472
is simply going
to Africa to plant coffee,

459
00:20:09,505 --> 00:20:12,107
you're very much mistaken.

460
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,406
In point of fact-
In point of fact,

461
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:18,208
coffee is the least
of Harry's interests.

462
00:20:18,241 --> 00:20:19,674
In point of fact,

463
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,342
the land he's acquiring

464
00:20:21,376 --> 00:20:24,377
is extremely rich
in certain minerals.

465
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:25,976
Minerals which are indispensable

466
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,443
to the production
of atomic energy.

467
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,677
Harry's land simply teams
with uranium.

468
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,245
It wouldn't surprise me

469
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:34,578
to see him become
the uranium king.

470
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:37,280
So you see,
my husband isn't such a ninny

471
00:20:37,313 --> 00:20:39,347
as you may have imagined.

472
00:20:39,381 --> 00:20:42,480
It might very well be worth
your while to go in with him.

473
00:20:42,513 --> 00:20:43,781
The potential mineral wealth

474
00:20:44,081 --> 00:20:45,714
of Africa
has hardly been scratched.

475
00:20:45,748 --> 00:20:47,515
So I was telling you
last night.

476
00:20:47,749 --> 00:20:50,482
But of course,
it's a well-known fact.

477
00:21:08,587 --> 00:21:09,922
Billy-Boy.

478
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:14,455
Had a happy day?

479
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:15,455
Very.

480
00:21:15,489 --> 00:21:16,856
I'm so glad.

481
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:19,391
What an attractive woman
Mrs. Chelm is.

482
00:21:19,423 --> 00:21:21,124
Is that what you called me over
to tell me?

483
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,925
- Who are the Chelms?
- They're English.

484
00:21:23,258 --> 00:21:25,425
Going out to British East.
They have a coffee plantation.

485
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,859
Any money in coffee?

486
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:28,759
No. But there's a type
of Englishman goes off

487
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:30,426
to coffee plantations
without caring

488
00:21:30,593 --> 00:21:32,193
whether there's any money
in it or not.

489
00:21:32,294 --> 00:21:34,261
Relatives leave them
coffee plantations

490
00:21:34,295 --> 00:21:35,794
and they go out to them.

491
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,728
But why this sudden interest
in the Chelms?

492
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:41,529
I just like to know who's
making friends with my friends.

493
00:21:41,562 --> 00:21:43,063
Well, now you know.

494
00:21:47,031 --> 00:21:49,132
I don't believe
one word...

495
00:21:56,133 --> 00:21:58,234
You know,
if I ever leave you,

496
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:01,868
it will be for someone
of the type of Harry Chelm.

497
00:22:01,901 --> 00:22:03,235
Well, bully for you.

498
00:22:03,268 --> 00:22:05,568
I suppose
that type of Englishman

499
00:22:05,602 --> 00:22:07,735
is like a story I once heard.

500
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:09,870
An English gardener in England

501
00:22:09,903 --> 00:22:14,570
was showing some Americans one
of those wonderful English lawns

502
00:22:14,604 --> 00:22:16,605
and of course
they wanted to know how

503
00:22:16,772 --> 00:22:19,873
to make a lawn like that,
and this English gardener said-

504
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:22,206
He said all you have to do
is get some good grass

505
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,107
and roll it every day
for 600 years.

506
00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:26,774
I heard that story
before you were born.

507
00:22:26,807 --> 00:22:29,875
Englishmen tell it when they're
feeling down in the mouth.

508
00:22:29,908 --> 00:22:32,176
You just don't understand
the Chelm type.

509
00:22:33,943 --> 00:22:35,576
You're not even listening.

510
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,877
You never do.

511
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,344
Some day I'll say goodbye

512
00:22:38,377 --> 00:22:41,145
and you won't hear that either.

513
00:22:41,178 --> 00:22:43,679
Some day I shall really
meet my type

514
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,046
and run off with him,

515
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:47,047
and you'll be simply amazed.

516
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,813
That's possible.

517
00:22:48,846 --> 00:22:50,447
George Moore said-

518
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,815
I learned it by heart years ago.

519
00:22:52,848 --> 00:22:55,248
He said that,
"Each great passion

520
00:22:55,282 --> 00:22:59,516
is the fruit
of many fruitless years".

521
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:02,251
George Moore was a very
distinguished English writer,

522
00:23:02,284 --> 00:23:03,450
you know.

523
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:05,550
Except that he was Irish.

524
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:06,918
Cheer up, sugar.

525
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,319
If I make a million
on this deal,

526
00:23:08,618 --> 00:23:10,986
I'll buy you
an old English lawn,

527
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:13,119
one we can roll up
and take with us.

528
00:23:18,221 --> 00:23:19,155
Billy.

529
00:23:19,188 --> 00:23:20,521
Good morning.

530
00:23:20,554 --> 00:23:22,622
Well, what's our wide-eyed
Irish leprechaun

531
00:23:22,655 --> 00:23:24,455
doing outside my door?

532
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:27,223
Why do you always make jokes
about my name? Huh?

533
00:23:27,257 --> 00:23:29,158
In Chile
the name of O'Hara is-

534
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:30,657
Is a tiptop name.

535
00:23:30,924 --> 00:23:33,792
Many Germans in Chile have
become to be called O'Hara.

536
00:23:33,825 --> 00:23:35,692
Good morning, Mr. O'Hara.

537
00:23:35,725 --> 00:23:37,327
Madame. My respects.

538
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,193
Perhaps Mr. O'Hara would
like something to drink?

539
00:23:40,226 --> 00:23:44,595
Yes, uh, maybe perhaps, uh,
a little whiskey, huh?

540
00:23:44,628 --> 00:23:46,228
Uh, very weak, please.

541
00:23:46,261 --> 00:23:48,296
What's this visit
in honor of?

542
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:53,496
Oh... just wanted to have
a little talk with you.

543
00:23:54,331 --> 00:23:55,930
Okay, but make it fast.

544
00:23:55,964 --> 00:23:57,864
Fast. Heh.

545
00:23:57,898 --> 00:24:00,166
I give you my word, Billy. I-

546
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:03,766
I give you my word.
I'll feel to you like, uh-

547
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,499
Like an older brother.

548
00:24:05,533 --> 00:24:07,367
Oh, it's not so much
the difference of age.

549
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,968
It's, uh-

550
00:24:09,001 --> 00:24:12,402
It's probably-
Yes, the reason is because-

551
00:24:12,436 --> 00:24:14,002
'Cause I come from a culture

552
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,003
which is so much older
than yours.

553
00:24:16,036 --> 00:24:19,870
In my country a child,
6- years-old,

554
00:24:19,904 --> 00:24:22,438
is older in his heart
than you will be at-

555
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,671
At- At 60.

556
00:24:24,538 --> 00:24:25,705
It smokes. It drinks.

557
00:24:25,738 --> 00:24:27,306
It philosophizes.

558
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,572
At this rate, I'll be 60
before you get to the point.

559
00:24:29,605 --> 00:24:32,940
The point-
The point is that-

560
00:24:32,974 --> 00:24:35,708
That Peterson,
Ravello and myself,

561
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:38,241
we are the principals
in this case.

562
00:24:38,275 --> 00:24:39,775
We are in with the money.

563
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:42,209
We cannot switch around
and turn and-

564
00:24:42,242 --> 00:24:44,277
But an agent,

565
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:47,677
it's easy to imagine
that he could conceivably-

566
00:24:47,711 --> 00:24:51,346
Doesn't feel himself quite
as irrevocably committed as-

567
00:24:51,379 --> 00:24:53,812
As, uh, Peterson or...

568
00:24:57,013 --> 00:24:59,014
We're fellow passengers,
I believe.

569
00:24:59,047 --> 00:25:00,414
Not quite yet,
would you say?

570
00:25:00,448 --> 00:25:01,448
Too sadly true.

571
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,948
By any chance you-

572
00:25:03,215 --> 00:25:05,248
You don't happen to have seen
your Mr. Dannreuther about?

573
00:25:05,282 --> 00:25:06,716
I don't think
Billy's up yet.

574
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:08,749
It's not 11.
He's rather a late riser.

575
00:25:08,782 --> 00:25:11,817
But he said- He said-
Well, anyway...

576
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,884
I shouldn't put too much stock
in what Billy says,

577
00:25:13,918 --> 00:25:15,718
particularly
when he's had a few drinks.

578
00:25:15,751 --> 00:25:17,252
Not that he means
to break his word,

579
00:25:17,552 --> 00:25:18,919
he just forgets
that he's given it.

580
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:21,720
Charm and dependability
so seldom go in one package.

581
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,220
There are exceptions,
of course.

582
00:25:23,253 --> 00:25:24,420
Your husband, I imagine,

583
00:25:24,753 --> 00:25:26,921
from his manner
and behavior, is one.

584
00:25:26,954 --> 00:25:29,356
Oh, yes, very-
Well, quite, I mean.

585
00:25:29,389 --> 00:25:31,255
I'm looking forward
to meeting your husband

586
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:33,323
and having a chat
about Africa.

587
00:25:33,357 --> 00:25:35,290
By all means.

588
00:25:35,323 --> 00:25:37,490
I understand
he's in coffee.

589
00:25:37,523 --> 00:25:39,257
You make it sound
like a total immersion.

590
00:25:39,624 --> 00:25:41,325
The part of Africa
we're going to

591
00:25:41,358 --> 00:25:43,325
is due for some
pretty important changes.

592
00:25:43,358 --> 00:25:45,159
In my opinion, things
will be booming out there

593
00:25:45,192 --> 00:25:47,126
before you can say
"Jack Robinson".

594
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,026
I do hope there won't be
too many changes.

595
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,577
It's completely unspoiled,
I hear,

596
00:25:50,626 --> 00:25:52,595
with some of the loveliest
scenery in the world.

597
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:55,312
I can't imagine anything more
lovely in the way of scenery

598
00:25:55,329 --> 00:25:56,598
than to have
a few acres of gold

599
00:25:56,662 --> 00:25:58,340
and diamonds cropping up
on a piece of land

600
00:25:58,462 --> 00:25:59,853
I'd bought for a song.

601
00:26:00,263 --> 00:26:01,296
Heaven forbid.

602
00:26:01,297 --> 00:26:03,831
The next thing there'd be
big ugly holes everywhere

603
00:26:03,865 --> 00:26:07,155
and great horrid machines
instead of, uh, lovely scenery.

604
00:26:07,998 --> 00:26:10,668
Anyway, I- I don't think
my husband worries much

605
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:12,741
about money and business,
that sort of thing.

606
00:26:12,766 --> 00:26:14,133
Really?

607
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:17,101
I mean, to appreciate
my husband's point of view,

608
00:26:17,134 --> 00:26:20,102
one has to understand
his background.

609
00:26:20,135 --> 00:26:23,069
Those lawns,
hundreds of years in the making.

610
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:25,502
Those immemorial elms.

611
00:26:25,535 --> 00:26:27,970
Those walls hung
with family portraits,

612
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:29,304
generations of them.

613
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,372
Those great echoing galleries

614
00:26:31,405 --> 00:26:33,472
where so much of English history
has been made.

615
00:26:34,972 --> 00:26:38,072
Taxes must be terrific
on a place like that.

616
00:26:38,106 --> 00:26:40,940
What would people
like the Chelms care about taxes

617
00:26:40,973 --> 00:26:42,375
with their kind of money?

618
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,174
I mean, when a family
has been a power

619
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:45,874
in the city of London
for so long,

620
00:26:45,907 --> 00:26:48,108
one of the great
financial families.

621
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:49,540
"A power in the city".

622
00:26:49,543 --> 00:26:52,809
You mean- Oh, yes, of course.
One of those Chelms.

623
00:26:54,144 --> 00:26:56,144
I'm surprised you know
about them at all.

624
00:26:56,177 --> 00:26:57,811
Very few people do.

625
00:26:57,845 --> 00:26:59,544
They prefer
to work behind the scenes.

626
00:26:59,578 --> 00:27:01,312
I find it rather hard
to believe

627
00:27:01,345 --> 00:27:03,480
that a man
in your husband's position

628
00:27:03,512 --> 00:27:06,414
would go to Africa
just for the coffee planting.

629
00:27:06,447 --> 00:27:08,913
You're very quick, aren't you?

630
00:27:08,947 --> 00:27:10,714
In point of fact, he isn't.

631
00:27:10,748 --> 00:27:13,416
In point of fact,
he has a very special reason.

632
00:27:13,449 --> 00:27:14,882
So I suspected.

633
00:27:14,915 --> 00:27:17,783
It has to do with... sin.

634
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,450
Sin?

635
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:23,485
Since the war, my husband
has been almost exclusively

636
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:26,285
concerned with spiritual values.

637
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:28,519
He feels that
if he can get away there,

638
00:27:28,552 --> 00:27:30,086
in the heart of Africa,

639
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,120
he will come face to face
with essentials.

640
00:27:32,153 --> 00:27:35,520
He wants to work out
the problem of sin.

641
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:36,521
Sin?

642
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,288
Why, yes, of course.

643
00:27:38,322 --> 00:27:41,289
Isn't that what we're all
most concerned with?

644
00:27:41,323 --> 00:27:42,356
Sin.

645
00:27:44,656 --> 00:27:46,690
Gwendolen,
what are you doing here?

646
00:27:46,823 --> 00:27:48,691
I thought we were supposed
to meet on the beach.

647
00:27:48,724 --> 00:27:50,425
Harry, I want you to meet Mr...

648
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:51,892
My name is Peterson.

649
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,192
I've been having the most
delightful talk to your wife.

650
00:27:54,326 --> 00:27:57,127
She tells me you're- You're
interested in spiritual values.

651
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,693
I myself am
vastly concerned-

652
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,328
Harry, we really
better be going.

653
00:28:00,361 --> 00:28:02,660
You'll excuse us,
Mr. Peterson.

654
00:28:02,694 --> 00:28:04,362
What have you been
telling that man?

655
00:28:04,396 --> 00:28:05,795
Why, nothing, Harry.

656
00:28:05,828 --> 00:28:07,363
He got on to the subject
of religion,

657
00:28:07,796 --> 00:28:09,397
and I just happened to mention
that we usually go

658
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,364
to church on Sunday.

659
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,098
Billy, I-
I think it is high time

660
00:28:15,132 --> 00:28:17,032
you take stock of yourself.

661
00:28:17,065 --> 00:28:19,433
Can you truthfully say
about yourself, I-

662
00:28:19,466 --> 00:28:20,932
I, Billy Dannreuther,

663
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:25,067
have acted fairly and squarely
to my associates, huh?

664
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,934
But of course he can,
Mr. O'Hara.

665
00:28:26,968 --> 00:28:28,734
Everybody knows Billy
is the soul of honor.

666
00:28:28,768 --> 00:28:29,834
Shut up, sugar.

667
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:31,269
Perhaps he is the soul of honor

668
00:28:31,469 --> 00:28:33,336
and perhaps appearances
are deceiving.

669
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:35,970
Do you mind telling me what it
is I'm supposed to have done?

670
00:28:36,003 --> 00:28:37,170
Nothing.

671
00:28:37,203 --> 00:28:38,904
It's your conduct.
Your- Your-

672
00:28:38,937 --> 00:28:41,405
Your conduct doesn't-

673
00:28:41,438 --> 00:28:43,805
Your conduct does
not inspire confidence and-

674
00:28:43,838 --> 00:28:46,806
And confidence, Billy,
is the most important necessity

675
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:48,539
in an undertaking of our kind.

676
00:28:48,572 --> 00:28:50,107
One may be completely innocent,

677
00:28:50,207 --> 00:28:51,774
but if one's actions
invite suspicion,

678
00:28:51,807 --> 00:28:53,408
one might as well be guilty.

679
00:28:53,541 --> 00:28:56,042
To be trustworthy
is not more important than-

680
00:28:56,075 --> 00:28:58,942
Than to seem to be trustworthy.

681
00:29:01,943 --> 00:29:04,643
Billy, have you done something
you shouldn't have?

682
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:07,978
Tell me, Billy.

683
00:29:08,011 --> 00:29:09,545
Tell me the truth.

684
00:29:09,578 --> 00:29:12,246
My conduct.

685
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:14,846
Who do they think I am,
their hired man?

686
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,447
But you are,
you know.

687
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,048
You are
their hired man.

688
00:29:19,081 --> 00:29:22,082
How good and kind of you
to remind me.

689
00:29:22,115 --> 00:29:24,616
How good. How true.

690
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:26,450
How kind.

691
00:29:41,953 --> 00:29:42,987
Oh, I say, Dannreuther.

692
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,488
Good to see you.
How about a drink?

693
00:29:44,854 --> 00:29:46,221
Well, I, uh-
Oh, come on, my dear fellow,

694
00:29:46,255 --> 00:29:47,789
let me buy you a drink.

695
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:52,290
Oh, uh, Gwendolen, don't forget
to send one to Aunt Beatrice.

696
00:29:55,425 --> 00:29:56,924
Can't understand it.

697
00:29:57,158 --> 00:29:59,691
Gwendolen distinctly said she'd
join me on the beach,

698
00:29:59,725 --> 00:30:01,992
then I come back and find her
sitting there in that café.

699
00:30:02,025 --> 00:30:03,726
Extraordinary creatures, women.

700
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:05,326
Well, let's drink
to them.

701
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,327
- Pernod.
- Scotch.

702
00:30:07,361 --> 00:30:09,494
Come on, you tiny little wreck.
Have a drink.

703
00:30:09,528 --> 00:30:10,795
We're drinking
to women.

704
00:30:13,328 --> 00:30:16,363
Take the drink,
but won't join you in the toast.

705
00:30:16,396 --> 00:30:17,629
A glass of Irish.

706
00:30:17,662 --> 00:30:18,963
Women.

707
00:30:19,097 --> 00:30:21,164
Hitler had the right idea.
Keep them in their place.

708
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:24,432
"Babies in the kitchen".

709
00:30:24,465 --> 00:30:26,698
Say what you want to about
Hitler, he had his points.

710
00:30:26,732 --> 00:30:27,799
Come, come. Look here.

711
00:30:28,132 --> 00:30:29,632
This generation's
had its chance.

712
00:30:29,665 --> 00:30:31,467
Hitler, Mussolini,
those were the men.

713
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,467
Now is the age
of the barbarians.

714
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,801
The world's going up in smoke.

715
00:30:35,034 --> 00:30:36,168
I say let it come.
Get it over with.

716
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:37,501
Well, if you don't mind,

717
00:30:37,768 --> 00:30:39,768
I'd like another year
or so of worrying.

718
00:30:39,802 --> 00:30:41,736
Worrying?
Just one minute, laddies.

719
00:30:41,836 --> 00:30:43,702
I've just two or three words
to say to you laddies,

720
00:30:43,736 --> 00:30:44,903
and that's don't worry.

721
00:30:44,936 --> 00:30:46,304
Don't ever worry.

722
00:30:46,337 --> 00:30:47,837
I'm in a position to know.

723
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,137
Secret information.

724
00:30:49,171 --> 00:30:50,439
The Rosicrucians.

725
00:30:50,738 --> 00:30:52,671
The great white brotherhood.
The high secret orders.

726
00:30:52,704 --> 00:30:55,139
But you've no faith.
You must have faith.

727
00:30:55,173 --> 00:30:56,806
Faith and power. Secret power.

728
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:58,940
Men who guard the trust
from the deepest insides

729
00:30:58,973 --> 00:31:00,174
of the whatchamacallit.

730
00:31:00,307 --> 00:31:02,241
Mystic rulers.
All one club.

731
00:31:02,275 --> 00:31:04,341
Chained together by one purpose.
One idea.

732
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:06,608
Mankind's champions.
Follow me, Billy?

733
00:31:06,642 --> 00:31:08,575
Oh, why, of course.

734
00:31:08,608 --> 00:31:10,444
This generation's
had its chance.

735
00:31:10,477 --> 00:31:11,709
Hitler, Mussolini.

736
00:31:11,843 --> 00:31:13,111
I can't stand here
and permit you-

737
00:31:13,144 --> 00:31:14,677
Are you interrupting me?

738
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,479
Relax, Jack.
Have another drink.

739
00:31:16,778 --> 00:31:19,112
I simply want to state
that things don't happen to be

740
00:31:19,145 --> 00:31:20,979
what certain people imagine.

741
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:23,180
An officer may find himself
strapped for money

742
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:25,081
and he may undertake
certain things

743
00:31:25,181 --> 00:31:27,914
which in other circumstances,
no, absolutely no.

744
00:31:27,947 --> 00:31:28,981
Absolutely.

745
00:31:29,282 --> 00:31:31,648
I mean, uh,
absolutely no.

746
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,049
In the old days I should have
simply told people of your ilk

747
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:35,283
to buy their own drinks.

748
00:31:35,316 --> 00:31:37,451
Poor old Jack.

749
00:31:37,484 --> 00:31:40,218
I'll teach you.

750
00:31:40,251 --> 00:31:44,752
I'll teach you to insult an
ex-officer of the Indian army.

751
00:31:44,785 --> 00:31:47,786
Well, are you yellow?

752
00:31:49,586 --> 00:31:52,121
The bar.

753
00:31:52,154 --> 00:31:53,288
You're Major Ross?

754
00:31:53,321 --> 00:31:54,488
Right.

755
00:31:58,089 --> 00:31:59,656
Ross here.

756
00:31:59,689 --> 00:32:01,056
Right.

757
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,291
Right again.

758
00:32:03,324 --> 00:32:04,857
Come along.
The Committee.

759
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,458
Saved by the bell.

760
00:32:10,792 --> 00:32:12,326
I've never heard such rot
in my life.

761
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:14,193
Sin. Oh, sin.

762
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:16,160
All I could do was to keep
a straight face.

763
00:32:16,194 --> 00:32:17,561
No. I'm certain of it now.

764
00:32:17,993 --> 00:32:19,961
These are two very clever
and dangerous antagonists.

765
00:32:19,994 --> 00:32:21,328
Sit here and help me close this.

766
00:32:21,794 --> 00:32:23,995
But how could they possibly know
what we're up to?

767
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:26,363
Great interests like the Chelms
have ways and means.

768
00:32:26,397 --> 00:32:28,197
Yes, and I'm convinced
they're out to get us

769
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,663
even before we get started.

770
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,831
We must get ahead of them.

771
00:32:31,264 --> 00:32:32,697
Time has entered the picture
in a new way.

772
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,499
Never forget the time factor,
gentlemen.

773
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:36,199
It always enters the picture
in the end.

774
00:32:36,232 --> 00:32:37,567
I'm sending a cable
to London.

775
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:40,100
I want full information
on those Chelm interests.

776
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:42,468
British Africa too.
Check up on his interests there.

777
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:43,700
Every time the plane lands,

778
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,268
I'll try and reach you
by telephone.

779
00:32:45,535 --> 00:32:47,202
Keep me informed
of the latest developments.

780
00:32:47,235 --> 00:32:49,470
Dannreuther,
that lying, swinish,

781
00:32:49,503 --> 00:32:50,869
rum-swilling, double-crosser.

782
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,303
What pleasure it would give me-

783
00:32:52,735 --> 00:32:54,703
Ah, ah, no, you can't
at the moment. We need him.

784
00:32:54,736 --> 00:32:57,171
Right now we need that swinish,
lying double-

785
00:32:57,205 --> 00:32:59,004
Did I hear my name?

786
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:00,171
Rub-a-dub-dub.

787
00:33:00,205 --> 00:33:02,905
Three men in a tub.

788
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,406
Tub?

789
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:06,806
Oh, heh-heh-heh.

790
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,340
Been a change of plan,
Billy-Boy.

791
00:33:08,441 --> 00:33:09,674
You and I are leaving
for Africa.

792
00:33:09,707 --> 00:33:11,007
How's that?

793
00:33:11,141 --> 00:33:13,042
You and I are flying to Africa
by the next plane.

794
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:14,442
Oh, what's happened,
Peterson?

795
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,577
It must be something important
to get you on a plane.

796
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:18,009
Perfectly simple,
Billy-Boy.

797
00:33:18,543 --> 00:33:20,377
The trouble with the oil pump
and the general uncertainty

798
00:33:20,411 --> 00:33:22,010
<i>about when the Nyanga will sail</i>

799
00:33:22,111 --> 00:33:24,078
forces me to sacrifice
my personal comfort.

800
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:27,345
I prefer to fly rather than run
the risk of arriving too late.

801
00:33:27,378 --> 00:33:30,046
Well, there's also such a thing
as arriving too early.

802
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:32,214
What do you mean by that?
The land doesn't come up

803
00:33:32,247 --> 00:33:34,013
for auction
for a couple of weeks.

804
00:33:34,047 --> 00:33:35,881
My friend can't make
his move until then.

805
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,181
If we sit around in British East
all that time,

806
00:33:38,215 --> 00:33:41,349
somebody's gonna start wondering
who we are and ask questions.

807
00:33:41,382 --> 00:33:42,748
Is that your real opinion,
Billy,

808
00:33:42,782 --> 00:33:44,050
or are you just looking forward

809
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,217
to a long sea voyage
with the attractive

810
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,784
Mrs. Chelm as your companion?

811
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,617
Or perhaps you have
even other reasons.

812
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,884
Such as?

813
00:33:51,185 --> 00:33:52,651
That's for you to know
and for us to find out.

814
00:33:52,685 --> 00:33:54,519
You better get
your packing done.

815
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:03,188
Billy, where are you going?

816
00:34:03,222 --> 00:34:05,222
Off to Africa.
Flying.

817
00:34:05,255 --> 00:34:07,089
Just like that?

818
00:34:07,123 --> 00:34:09,323
Weren't you even going
to kiss me goodbye?

819
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:15,724
I wish-

820
00:34:15,757 --> 00:34:16,824
Don't say it.

821
00:34:16,858 --> 00:34:17,824
What?

822
00:34:17,858 --> 00:34:19,092
That you wish we'd never met.

823
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:20,259
You'll be coming on the boat

824
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,860
and in Africa
we'll get together and-

825
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,659
I think I hate you.

826
00:34:23,693 --> 00:34:26,228
Letting those revolting men
order you about.

827
00:34:26,261 --> 00:34:27,861
Don't deny it.
I've watched them.

828
00:34:27,961 --> 00:34:29,428
They treat you
like a servant.

829
00:34:29,461 --> 00:34:33,329
They say hop it
and off you hop.

830
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,963
I know what it is.

831
00:34:34,996 --> 00:34:36,396
They have a hold on you.

832
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:39,364
Some black secret
that could ruin you.

833
00:34:39,397 --> 00:34:41,232
Oh, what makes you think that?

834
00:34:41,265 --> 00:34:42,965
Oh, it happens all the time.

835
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,465
My old Spanish nurse told me

836
00:34:44,931 --> 00:34:46,632
that half the people in the
world would be ruined at once

837
00:34:46,665 --> 00:34:49,267
if everyone told
what they knew.

838
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,767
But... couldn't you have them
done away with?

839
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:56,001
I mean, you must know plenty of
people who could bump them off.

840
00:34:57,202 --> 00:34:58,536
It'd probably cost
a good deal,

841
00:34:58,635 --> 00:34:59,935
but it'd be worth it certainly.

842
00:34:59,969 --> 00:35:01,203
Oh, it's not impossible.

843
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,337
Except that afterwards
I wouldn't have any money.

844
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,338
This way I stand to make a lot.

845
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:06,538
Millions?
Maybe.

846
00:35:08,071 --> 00:35:10,139
Then perhaps your connection
with those men

847
00:35:10,172 --> 00:35:13,806
isn't quite so undignified
as I thought.

848
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,907
Those millions, would they be,
uh, pounds or dollars?

849
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,208
Oh, either way suits me.

850
00:35:20,242 --> 00:35:22,108
Now, that's very careless
of you.

851
00:35:22,142 --> 00:35:23,842
The state of the pound
is so uncertain.

852
00:35:24,042 --> 00:35:26,642
You must think in terms
of hard currency.

853
00:35:26,675 --> 00:35:29,843
Maybe I should hire you
to handle my affairs.

854
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,711
You could do worse.

855
00:35:31,744 --> 00:35:34,411
I'm awfully intelligent,
really.

856
00:35:34,445 --> 00:35:36,712
Come along, Billy-Boy.
The car's waiting.

857
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:56,484
If we can't go faster than this,
we'll miss the plane. Press on.

858
00:35:56,518 --> 00:35:57,917
Press on.

859
00:36:06,019 --> 00:36:07,454
Try posting.

860
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,095
Push, push.

861
00:36:42,029 --> 00:36:45,197
Come on.
One, two, three!

862
00:37:15,471 --> 00:37:16,838
Driver, driver!

863
00:38:14,786 --> 00:38:19,021
My car, my car!
My beautiful car.

864
00:38:19,054 --> 00:38:20,820
You did that on purpose.
What?!

865
00:38:20,854 --> 00:38:22,155
You planned it that way.

866
00:38:22,489 --> 00:38:23,988
I know what you're up to.
I know everything.

867
00:38:24,155 --> 00:38:25,923
I know about the uranium
on the Chelms' land.

868
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:27,657
The Chelm interests
in the city of London.

869
00:38:27,689 --> 00:38:28,756
The what?

870
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:30,224
You heard me.
The Chelm interests.

871
00:38:30,757 --> 00:38:32,491
I take it your information comes
from a reliable source.

872
00:38:32,524 --> 00:38:34,358
It does. From Mrs. Chelm
herself, in fact.

873
00:38:34,492 --> 00:38:36,425
Ha, ha. Magnificent.
Simply magnificent.

874
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:38,692
You must pay me back for
the loss of my beautiful car.

875
00:38:38,725 --> 00:38:40,326
If you weren't
a benighted jackass,

876
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,960
if you could see
as far as you spit,

877
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,194
you'd know there's no such
thing as the Chelm interests.

878
00:38:44,227 --> 00:38:46,461
You'll have to do better
than that, Mr. Dannreuther,

879
00:38:46,495 --> 00:38:47,662
very much better than that.

880
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:49,563
Don't believe me!
Check with London.

881
00:38:49,795 --> 00:38:51,828
If you find out he's anything
more than a down-at-heel

882
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:55,297
Gloucestershire squire, you can
have my services for nothing.

883
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:58,364
You mean, Mrs. Chelm
is an unqualified liar?

884
00:38:58,398 --> 00:39:00,399
Well, let's say she uses
her imagination

885
00:39:00,432 --> 00:39:01,865
rather than her memory.

886
00:39:02,098 --> 00:39:04,933
You will make restitution,
will you no, Mr. Dann?

887
00:39:04,966 --> 00:39:06,667
Either the money
or a new car.

888
00:39:07,066 --> 00:39:09,534
Why, you fat bandit, I gave you
the car in the first place.

889
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:12,901
How I came by it
is beside the point.

890
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:14,768
The fact you gave it to me

891
00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:16,835
doesn't make it
any the less mine.

892
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:18,136
Shut up.

893
00:39:18,169 --> 00:39:20,937
That's right, threaten me.

894
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:23,938
It is not enough that you
destroy my beautiful car.

895
00:39:23,971 --> 00:39:24,938
Now you-

896
00:39:26,305 --> 00:39:28,039
My beautiful car.

897
00:39:29,439 --> 00:39:31,040
Stop!
Hey, stop.

898
00:39:38,341 --> 00:39:39,708
More than anything,

899
00:39:39,841 --> 00:39:43,876
I want Billy to make
a grand success out there.

900
00:39:43,909 --> 00:39:46,678
Well, as you care so much
about money,

901
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,678
I should have thought
you would have left Billy

902
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,278
for some rich man.

903
00:39:50,312 --> 00:39:52,711
I shouldn't think Billy
would mind, really.

904
00:39:52,744 --> 00:39:56,580
I mean, neither of you are
in love or anything.

905
00:39:56,613 --> 00:39:58,880
You are a strange girl.

906
00:39:58,913 --> 00:40:00,746
Of course I love Billy.

907
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,914
Actually,
I adore him.

908
00:40:02,948 --> 00:40:08,482
And Billy loves me very, very,
but very much.

909
00:40:08,516 --> 00:40:12,183
That's why I trust him with
his little unimportant amours.

910
00:40:12,217 --> 00:40:14,084
And what does he say
about yours?

911
00:40:14,218 --> 00:40:17,586
But, darling, all husbands
like their wives

912
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:20,385
to seem attractive
to other men.

913
00:40:23,553 --> 00:40:25,987
Be sure you to explain
that to Harry.

914
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,387
I'm going back to the hotel.

915
00:40:33,323 --> 00:40:35,389
Mrs. Dannreuther, Maria.

916
00:40:35,423 --> 00:40:39,057
I have, I'm afraid- I have
some shocking news for you.

917
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,658
The boat is not going
at all?

918
00:40:40,757 --> 00:40:43,124
There's been
a terrible accident.

919
00:40:43,158 --> 00:40:45,092
Your husband's car drove
over a cliff.

920
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:47,892
The people on the bus saw it
fall into the sea.

921
00:40:47,925 --> 00:40:50,126
It seems almost certain that-

922
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,328
What is it? What-?
What are you trying to say?

923
00:40:54,361 --> 00:40:56,629
He's saying
that Billy is dead.

924
00:40:57,728 --> 00:40:58,861
It's become necessary

925
00:40:59,229 --> 00:41:01,263
to redistribute the stock
in our company.

926
00:41:01,296 --> 00:41:02,463
Stock. Stock.

927
00:41:02,496 --> 00:41:04,231
What good is the stock now?

928
00:41:04,264 --> 00:41:07,097
We can't deal
with Dannreuther's friend,

929
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,864
not without Dannreuther.

930
00:41:08,898 --> 00:41:10,198
All the effort.

931
00:41:10,232 --> 00:41:11,466
The money.

932
00:41:11,633 --> 00:41:14,333
Everything went over the cliff
with that car.

933
00:41:14,366 --> 00:41:17,900
Ravello, you forget the English
are very sentimental people.

934
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:20,301
I tell you, there is nothing
that Billy's friend

935
00:41:20,335 --> 00:41:21,668
will not do for his widow.

936
00:41:22,034 --> 00:41:27,337
And in black, mwah,
she's a very touching figure.

937
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,970
Poor Maria.

938
00:41:29,003 --> 00:41:31,837
You really have had a-
A wretched time of it.

939
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:34,338
You are very understanding.

940
00:41:34,371 --> 00:41:37,472
If only there was something
I could do.

941
00:41:37,505 --> 00:41:42,541
Just now if you could bring me
an aspirin. I have a headache.

942
00:41:42,574 --> 00:41:45,374
Don't move. Just you wait there.
I'll be back in a moment.

943
00:41:47,675 --> 00:41:51,209
Mussolini, Hitler
and now Peterson.

944
00:41:51,243 --> 00:41:54,010
A great man.
A great loss.

945
00:41:54,043 --> 00:41:58,311
I'm... I'm going upstairs
and read my bible.

946
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:02,546
Why all the gloom?

947
00:42:04,446 --> 00:42:06,146
Maria has a headache.

948
00:42:09,847 --> 00:42:11,014
What's the matter with you?

949
00:42:12,348 --> 00:42:13,781
Go away.

950
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:16,182
My dear girl, I'm as sorry
about Dannreuther as you are,

951
00:42:16,282 --> 00:42:18,583
but after all, it isn't as if he
was one of our oldest friends.

952
00:42:18,617 --> 00:42:19,782
I was in love with him.

953
00:42:20,016 --> 00:42:21,684
He was a very pleasant
acquaintance.

954
00:42:21,718 --> 00:42:23,384
What did you say?

955
00:42:23,417 --> 00:42:24,584
I was in love with him.

956
00:42:24,884 --> 00:42:26,185
Really, darling,
have you no control

957
00:42:26,218 --> 00:42:27,685
over your romantic fantasies?

958
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:29,152
I loved him.

959
00:42:29,186 --> 00:42:30,453
Can't you hear me?

960
00:42:30,486 --> 00:42:32,886
I loved him, I loved him!

961
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,153
Oh, rot.
You're just dramatizing again.

962
00:42:35,187 --> 00:42:39,188
By George, you were right
after all. Ha! I did pack it.

963
00:42:39,221 --> 00:42:42,855
Oh, what shall I do?

964
00:42:44,323 --> 00:42:46,690
I feel as though
I were drowning.

965
00:42:46,724 --> 00:42:49,558
He's dead.

966
00:42:49,591 --> 00:42:54,192
He's dead, and I'm left
with a fool like you.

967
00:42:54,225 --> 00:42:56,460
I'll tell you what to do.
Have a bit of shuteye.

968
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:58,660
You'll wake up in an hour
feeling your old self again,

969
00:42:58,693 --> 00:43:00,327
and there'll be no more
silly stories

970
00:43:00,793 --> 00:43:03,595
about falling for a middle-aged
roustabout, rest his soul.

971
00:43:03,629 --> 00:43:05,428
Oh, please go away.

972
00:43:05,462 --> 00:43:06,894
I'll just take these to Maria.

973
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:16,331
Mr. Chelm,
this is very important,

974
00:43:16,365 --> 00:43:18,398
for you as well
as for myself.

975
00:43:18,431 --> 00:43:19,765
Yes, well, get on with it.

976
00:43:19,965 --> 00:43:21,532
There is now
an opportunity for you

977
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:24,500
to secure enormous profits
with virtually no risk.

978
00:43:24,533 --> 00:43:26,400
I won't beat about the bush.

979
00:43:26,433 --> 00:43:27,568
Our purpose in going to...

980
00:43:27,767 --> 00:43:29,134
For you, as Billy's widow,

981
00:43:29,468 --> 00:43:31,636
it will be very easy to persuade
his friend in British East.

982
00:43:31,669 --> 00:43:33,935
And- And for capital,
we have Chelm.

983
00:43:33,968 --> 00:43:36,503
Quite evidently you've been
misinformed as to my interests.

984
00:43:48,539 --> 00:43:50,674
What's the matter
with all of you?

985
00:43:50,707 --> 00:43:51,873
Is somebody dead?

986
00:43:51,906 --> 00:43:54,541
The car.
It went over a cliff.

987
00:43:54,575 --> 00:43:56,408
We thought
you'd both been killed.

988
00:43:56,441 --> 00:43:58,476
Dannreuther, I'm delighted
to see you're alive.

989
00:43:58,509 --> 00:44:00,309
But your wife is
in a fainting condition.

990
00:44:00,576 --> 00:44:02,377
You mean, you're not dead
at all?

991
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:03,943
Obviously I'm not dead.

992
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:05,578
I knew you weren't dead.

993
00:44:05,678 --> 00:44:07,678
I counted 13 backwards
13 times.

994
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,579
My old Spanish nurse said
if you did that,

995
00:44:09,778 --> 00:44:12,045
a miracle would happen,
and you see it has.

996
00:44:13,613 --> 00:44:16,681
Ladies and gentlemen, I bring
you the glad tidings.

997
00:44:16,714 --> 00:44:18,014
The captain is sober,

998
00:44:18,347 --> 00:44:20,314
<i>and the S.S. Nyanga
will sail at midnight.</i>

999
00:44:32,585 --> 00:44:34,184
I can't see it anywhere.

1000
00:44:35,618 --> 00:44:37,686
What can have happened to it?

1001
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:39,185
My dispatch box, where is it?

1002
00:44:39,586 --> 00:44:41,520
A black tin box, this size.
What have you done with it?

1003
00:44:44,321 --> 00:44:46,454
I told you to take the most
particular care of it.

1004
00:44:46,787 --> 00:44:48,855
I shall not go onboard till
my dispatch box has been found.

1005
00:44:48,888 --> 00:44:50,255
Having trouble, Chelm?

1006
00:44:50,489 --> 00:44:52,023
Nothing I can't cope
with myself, thank you.

1007
00:44:57,790 --> 00:44:59,958
He says he put it in your cabin.
Whatever it is.

1008
00:44:59,991 --> 00:45:02,625
Idiot. Why didn't he say so
in the first place?

1009
00:45:04,925 --> 00:45:07,993
Say, look, what's happened
to Harry?

1010
00:45:08,027 --> 00:45:09,926
He's been giving me
the fisheye all evening.

1011
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,794
- Oh.
- What is it?

1012
00:45:11,827 --> 00:45:14,228
Perhaps it's because when I
thought you were dead, I-

1013
00:45:14,261 --> 00:45:15,828
I told him
I was in love with you.

1014
00:45:15,862 --> 00:45:16,962
You what?

1015
00:45:16,995 --> 00:45:17,995
I couldn't help it.

1016
00:45:18,129 --> 00:45:19,563
It made you seem less dead.

1017
00:45:19,597 --> 00:45:20,563
And?

1018
00:45:20,597 --> 00:45:21,829
Oh, he didn't believe me.

1019
00:45:21,963 --> 00:45:23,631
He thought my nerves were upset.

1020
00:45:23,665 --> 00:45:25,298
A sort of delirium.

1021
00:45:25,331 --> 00:45:26,666
He thought it quite a joke,

1022
00:45:26,898 --> 00:45:29,065
the idea of my inventing
a love affair

1023
00:45:29,098 --> 00:45:30,832
with a middle-aged
roustabout like you.

1024
00:45:30,866 --> 00:45:31,999
That's what he called you.

1025
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,600
Well, now, that I'm back
in the flesh,

1026
00:45:34,034 --> 00:45:37,567
he'll begin wondering about
that delirium of yours.

1027
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:39,101
I suppose seeing you alive

1028
00:45:39,135 --> 00:45:41,402
is different
from thinking of you dead.

1029
00:45:41,435 --> 00:45:43,403
It'll be just great,
cooped up on that tub

1030
00:45:43,436 --> 00:45:44,770
with a suspicious husband.

1031
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:50,904
Billy,

1032
00:45:54,706 --> 00:45:55,773
let's not go.

1033
00:45:55,805 --> 00:45:57,173
What do you mean?

1034
00:45:59,939 --> 00:46:02,574
I'm asking you
to run away with me.

1035
00:46:02,608 --> 00:46:03,874
Now.

1036
00:46:03,907 --> 00:46:05,709
What about the millions
in hard currency?

1037
00:46:05,742 --> 00:46:07,275
What's happened to you?

1038
00:46:07,409 --> 00:46:09,576
I thought you were
my shrewd little manager.

1039
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:11,710
I've changed my point of view.

1040
00:46:11,743 --> 00:46:14,210
I thought we'd get to Africa
and you'd make your fortune

1041
00:46:14,244 --> 00:46:15,843
and everything
would be wonderful.

1042
00:46:16,044 --> 00:46:18,944
But now I think
it's all too risky.

1043
00:46:18,978 --> 00:46:20,780
Too many things can happen.

1044
00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:22,613
I want us to cut
and run for it. Right now.

1045
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:24,347
You really mean that?
With all my heart.

1046
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,113
Oh, no, that's impossible.

1047
00:46:26,147 --> 00:46:27,580
Why?
Well, for one thing,

1048
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,381
Mrs. Dannreuther
might not go for the idea.

1049
00:46:29,615 --> 00:46:31,315
She's not quite
as sophisticated as you are.

1050
00:46:31,348 --> 00:46:33,082
Please, Billy, listen to me.

1051
00:46:33,115 --> 00:46:34,349
I've thought it all out.

1052
00:46:34,382 --> 00:46:35,750
We'll take the bus and-

1053
00:46:35,784 --> 00:46:37,417
And catch an express
for somewhere-

1054
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:40,184
No, no, the shot's not
on the table.

1055
00:46:40,217 --> 00:46:41,950
You're not in love
the way I am.

1056
00:46:42,418 --> 00:46:44,252
If I loved you a thousand times
more than you say you love me,

1057
00:46:44,285 --> 00:46:45,985
it still wouldn't make
any difference.

1058
00:46:46,018 --> 00:46:47,486
I've got to have money.

1059
00:46:47,753 --> 00:46:49,486
Doctor's orders are that I must
have a lot of money,

1060
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,321
otherwise I become dull,
listless

1061
00:46:51,354 --> 00:46:53,054
and have trouble
with my complexion.

1062
00:46:53,387 --> 00:46:55,322
But you're not like that now
and you haven't any money.

1063
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:57,555
It's my expectations
that hold me together.

1064
00:46:59,089 --> 00:47:00,756
You really mean that,
don't you, darling?

1065
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:02,122
Sure I mean it.

1066
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:04,190
And your main reason
for wanting lots of money

1067
00:47:04,223 --> 00:47:05,856
is so that you'll be
ever so attractive

1068
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:07,124
and I'll love you more and more.

1069
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,325
That's right, baby.

1070
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:10,759
I'll help you, Billy.

1071
00:47:10,793 --> 00:47:11,793
I can too.

1072
00:47:11,825 --> 00:47:14,125
I'm something of a witch.

1073
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:16,694
My old Spanish nurse said I
could have been a professional.

1074
00:47:16,727 --> 00:47:19,894
Well, don't look now, but
they're raising the gangway.

1075
00:47:33,564 --> 00:47:35,298
Sea air, ozone.

1076
00:47:35,332 --> 00:47:37,065
What a pity we can't bottle it,
gentlemen.

1077
00:47:37,098 --> 00:47:38,733
What a fortune we'd make.

1078
00:47:38,766 --> 00:47:40,132
Neptune's mixture.

1079
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:41,866
Now, breathe deeply.

1080
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,400
Remember, every breath is
a guinea in the bank of health.

1081
00:47:50,935 --> 00:47:52,069
Good morning, Chelm.

1082
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,737
Why, that's good.
Very good indeed.

1083
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:57,970
I didn't know you were
an artist, Mrs. Dannreuther.

1084
00:47:58,004 --> 00:48:00,004
I'd hardly call myself that.

1085
00:48:00,037 --> 00:48:01,605
I only dabble.

1086
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:03,339
The nose
is not enough long.

1087
00:48:03,372 --> 00:48:04,707
The ears are too small.

1088
00:48:04,939 --> 00:48:05,807
Only has one eye.

1089
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:07,239
Come along, gentlemen,

1090
00:48:07,273 --> 00:48:09,840
we must not dawdle.

1091
00:48:09,873 --> 00:48:11,441
* Blow the man down, bully

1092
00:48:11,474 --> 00:48:13,308
* Blow the man down

1093
00:48:13,342 --> 00:48:16,710
* Blow, blow
Blow the man down *

1094
00:48:16,743 --> 00:48:20,177
* Blow the man down, bully
Blow the man down *

1095
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:23,444
Good morning, Mrs. Chelm.
Let's hope she breaks her neck.

1096
00:48:23,477 --> 00:48:26,611
* Blow the man down, bully
Blow the man down *

1097
00:48:26,645 --> 00:48:28,512
* Blow the man down, bully

1098
00:48:28,546 --> 00:48:33,946
* Blow the man down
Blow, blow, blow the man down *

1099
00:48:33,979 --> 00:48:37,414
* Blow the man down, bully
Blow the man down *

1100
00:48:37,448 --> 00:48:40,716
* Give me some time
To blow the man down *

1101
00:48:40,749 --> 00:48:43,350
Mr. Peterson.
Mr. Peterson.

1102
00:48:43,383 --> 00:48:44,849
A radiogram.

1103
00:49:00,821 --> 00:49:03,921
"No Chelm estate
Gloucestershire. Stop.

1104
00:49:03,954 --> 00:49:06,489
No landed gentry Chelm".

1105
00:49:06,522 --> 00:49:08,022
What do you make of that?

1106
00:49:08,055 --> 00:49:09,656
He's not
a Gloucestershire squire.

1107
00:49:09,689 --> 00:49:11,056
Like Billy said.

1108
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:14,023
Just as I was beginning to take
Billy at his face value.

1109
00:49:14,056 --> 00:49:17,624
Yes, but if he is not what Billy
said, then- Then what is he?

1110
00:49:17,658 --> 00:49:21,025
We are at sea again, gentlemen.
In more ways than one.

1111
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:22,793
Mystery.
More mystery.

1112
00:49:22,827 --> 00:49:24,226
Billy is a liar.

1113
00:49:24,259 --> 00:49:26,394
Heaven only knows what Chelm is.

1114
00:49:26,427 --> 00:49:27,661
CID, maybe?

1115
00:49:27,694 --> 00:49:29,127
You borrowed my thought.

1116
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,994
What to do? What to do?

1117
00:49:31,028 --> 00:49:33,061
The time has come
for direct action.

1118
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,529
Do you remember last night
when we came onboard,

1119
00:49:35,563 --> 00:49:38,597
the fuss he was making
about his dispatch box?

1120
00:49:49,266 --> 00:49:51,367
I love colors.

1121
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,134
Working with them
is an endless puzzle.

1122
00:49:55,167 --> 00:49:56,769
Your face, for instance.

1123
00:49:56,802 --> 00:50:00,969
Ten minutes ago
it was all brown and pink.

1124
00:50:01,002 --> 00:50:04,903
Now the light has changed
and it's chalky white.

1125
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:07,604
What?

1126
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,772
Tinged with green.

1127
00:50:10,805 --> 00:50:11,871
Green?

1128
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,573
It must be getting rough.

1129
00:50:15,606 --> 00:50:17,140
Just a little.

1130
00:50:17,173 --> 00:50:19,842
Don't break the pose.

1131
00:50:19,874 --> 00:50:21,074
I don't feel very well.

1132
00:50:21,375 --> 00:50:23,709
I think I'll go below
and take a pill.

1133
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:31,076
It's incredible.
Harry Chelm is just-

1134
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:32,711
Just Harry Chelm.
Nothing. Nobody.

1135
00:50:32,745 --> 00:50:34,411
A ruddy refugee
from Earls Court.

1136
00:50:34,444 --> 00:50:36,512
With a hot water bottle.
Look.

1137
00:50:36,545 --> 00:50:37,746
And a letter of introduction

1138
00:50:38,045 --> 00:50:39,480
to the secretary
of the governor.

1139
00:50:39,513 --> 00:50:42,246
The secretary, mind you,
disgusting.

1140
00:50:43,347 --> 00:50:45,314
Purser, my box.

1141
00:50:45,347 --> 00:50:47,315
Uh, a bit up and down,
isn't it, sir?

1142
00:50:47,348 --> 00:50:48,348
It's gone.

1143
00:50:48,382 --> 00:50:49,382
Oh, yes, indeed.

1144
00:50:49,415 --> 00:50:50,683
Major Ross took it.

1145
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:52,750
I saw him sneak it
out of your cabin.

1146
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:54,950
I like to keep my eye on what
goes on aboard the ship.

1147
00:50:54,983 --> 00:50:56,050
Where did he take it?

1148
00:50:56,417 --> 00:50:57,751
I believe,
Mr. Peterson's cabin.

1149
00:50:57,784 --> 00:50:59,917
In fact, I'm sure.

1150
00:51:05,885 --> 00:51:06,886
Ah.

1151
00:51:09,986 --> 00:51:12,388
Now, may I ask what explanation
you have to offer?

1152
00:51:16,222 --> 00:51:18,623
He forgot
his hot water bottle.

1153
00:51:23,157 --> 00:51:25,157
Billy.
Come in.

1154
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,558
Billy, have you heard
what's happened?

1155
00:51:28,592 --> 00:51:30,292
Haven't seen
a paper in days.

1156
00:51:30,326 --> 00:51:31,493
It's not funny.

1157
00:51:31,659 --> 00:51:34,360
They've stolen
Harry's dispatch box.

1158
00:51:34,394 --> 00:51:35,861
Who stole his dispatch box?

1159
00:51:35,893 --> 00:51:37,428
That dreadful little major.

1160
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:39,795
He took it to Peterson.
They went through it.

1161
00:51:39,828 --> 00:51:40,995
Well, it's all your fault.

1162
00:51:41,362 --> 00:51:42,496
I suppose you know that.
My fault?

1163
00:51:42,696 --> 00:51:44,129
The poppycock
you've been peddling.

1164
00:51:44,596 --> 00:51:46,597
All that junk about
the Chelm interests in London.

1165
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:48,397
Uranium on your land.

1166
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:50,831
Well, in a way,
you're the one to blame.

1167
00:51:50,865 --> 00:51:51,930
I'm the-?

1168
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:54,465
I mean, you acted
so superior.

1169
00:51:54,499 --> 00:51:57,366
I was falling in love with you,
and I- I couldn't bear it

1170
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,899
for you to think
I was just a nobody

1171
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:02,200
married to the son of
a boardinghouse in Earls Court.

1172
00:52:02,234 --> 00:52:04,668
The- The son of a what?

1173
00:52:04,702 --> 00:52:06,368
A boardinghouse.

1174
00:52:06,402 --> 00:52:08,102
That's what
Harry's parents do.

1175
00:52:08,369 --> 00:52:11,503
They run a boardinghouse
for decayed gentlefolk.

1176
00:52:11,536 --> 00:52:13,804
Well, but the way he talks,
the way he acts. I thought-

1177
00:52:13,837 --> 00:52:15,904
It's just that he sees
himself in a place

1178
00:52:15,937 --> 00:52:18,438
in the west country
with trout streams and horses,

1179
00:52:18,471 --> 00:52:20,972
leading the life
of a country squire.

1180
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:23,139
It's not his fault if people
take it for granted

1181
00:52:23,172 --> 00:52:24,540
that he has a place like that.

1182
00:52:24,673 --> 00:52:26,173
He's never once said
that he had.

1183
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:28,007
Well, country gent,
son of a boardinghouse,

1184
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,174
or whatever he is,

1185
00:52:29,508 --> 00:52:31,007
I suppose I'd better
get his box back.

1186
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,242
Oh, he got it back himself.

1187
00:52:32,509 --> 00:52:33,709
Well, then,
there's no harm done.

1188
00:52:34,008 --> 00:52:35,510
Except that Harry's gone
to the captain.

1189
00:52:35,543 --> 00:52:37,909
He's going to have them
put in irons.

1190
00:52:37,942 --> 00:52:39,477
He is what?

1191
00:52:39,511 --> 00:52:41,711
He says that's what they did
in the Royal Marines.

1192
00:52:41,844 --> 00:52:44,178
Look here, skipper, there's
a perfectly simple explanation

1193
00:52:44,211 --> 00:52:45,311
for all this.

1194
00:52:45,345 --> 00:52:46,780
I happen to own a dispatch box

1195
00:52:47,012 --> 00:52:48,579
which is very similar
to Mr. Chelm's.

1196
00:52:48,613 --> 00:52:50,045
When I didn't find it
in my cabin,

1197
00:52:50,647 --> 00:52:52,080
I asked Major Ross to see
if it had been stowed away

1198
00:52:52,113 --> 00:52:53,580
somewhere else by mistake.

1199
00:52:53,781 --> 00:52:55,281
The major found
what he thought was my box

1200
00:52:55,515 --> 00:52:57,281
in the saloon
with some other luggage.

1201
00:52:57,314 --> 00:52:59,682
The box has been in my cabin
ever since we sailed.

1202
00:52:59,716 --> 00:53:01,182
Under the berth.

1203
00:53:01,382 --> 00:53:03,116
As soon as I saw the box,
of course I realized at once

1204
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:04,450
that it wasn't mine.

1205
00:53:04,784 --> 00:53:06,518
I simply opened it to find out
to whom it belonged

1206
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,818
so that I could return it
to its rightful owner.

1207
00:53:08,851 --> 00:53:11,051
I can't conceive why
this gentleman should imagine

1208
00:53:11,285 --> 00:53:14,019
I should be interested in a box
containing patent medicines.

1209
00:53:14,052 --> 00:53:15,820
Heh. I-
I'm not a hypochondriac.

1210
00:53:17,521 --> 00:53:20,587
Purser, tell the captain exactly
what you told me about the box.

1211
00:53:20,621 --> 00:53:23,288
Why, sir, you asked me
whether I'd seen it

1212
00:53:23,321 --> 00:53:24,722
and I said
it might be the one

1213
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:27,256
I had seen being carried along
the passage by Major Ross.

1214
00:53:27,289 --> 00:53:28,589
You distinctly told me

1215
00:53:28,823 --> 00:53:30,457
that you'd seen it being taken
from my cabin.

1216
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:33,458
Oh, you must have
misunderstood.

1217
00:53:33,491 --> 00:53:35,957
You were rather ill at the time,
if you remember, sir.

1218
00:53:35,991 --> 00:53:37,893
That's all, purser.

1219
00:53:37,925 --> 00:53:41,360
He's been bribed. He's in league
with these criminals.

1220
00:53:41,393 --> 00:53:43,660
Just a case
of a misunderstanding.

1221
00:53:43,693 --> 00:53:45,194
That's how I look at it.

1222
00:53:45,561 --> 00:53:48,395
Now, what about a little cognac
to wash away any ill feeling?

1223
00:53:48,429 --> 00:53:49,896
No, I don't care
for a drink.

1224
00:53:50,095 --> 00:53:51,762
And this matter is far
from settled.

1225
00:53:51,796 --> 00:53:54,029
While rifling through
my personal effects,

1226
00:53:54,062 --> 00:53:56,230
you must've noticed
I had a letter of introduction

1227
00:53:56,264 --> 00:53:57,764
to the secretary
of the governor.

1228
00:53:58,364 --> 00:54:00,432
I suspect he'll be much more
interested in what I have to say

1229
00:54:00,465 --> 00:54:02,799
than this gin-soaked,
so-called ship's captain.

1230
00:54:02,832 --> 00:54:04,132
You mind your tongue!

1231
00:54:04,466 --> 00:54:06,965
Anymore insults, you're the one
I put in irons!

1232
00:54:09,667 --> 00:54:13,568
As far as I am concerned,
this is a closed incident.

1233
00:54:16,402 --> 00:54:18,569
You've got your box back.

1234
00:54:18,602 --> 00:54:20,203
Why not forget
the whole thing?

1235
00:54:20,703 --> 00:54:22,537
What interest do you expect
the Colonial Office to take-?

1236
00:54:22,703 --> 00:54:25,104
On the contrary, I expect them
to take a considerable interest

1237
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:27,338
in a gang of crooks who are
trying to swindle a country

1238
00:54:27,372 --> 00:54:29,205
out of vast uranium deposits.

1239
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:39,708
Just one moment, sir.

1240
00:54:39,742 --> 00:54:41,141
What leads you to believe-

1241
00:54:41,542 --> 00:54:44,242
This gentleman obviously hasn't
seen fit to inform you

1242
00:54:44,276 --> 00:54:45,776
that during
your supposed demise,

1243
00:54:46,242 --> 00:54:48,577
he attempted to lure me
into your nefarious venture.

1244
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:50,344
Unfortunately for you,
he acquainted me

1245
00:54:50,378 --> 00:54:51,845
with all the pertinent facts.

1246
00:54:51,878 --> 00:54:53,445
Facts which I intend
to communicate

1247
00:54:53,878 --> 00:54:57,412
to the proper authority at
the very earliest opportunity.

1248
00:54:57,446 --> 00:55:00,580
I thought you were dead.
That's what they told me.

1249
00:55:00,613 --> 00:55:02,047
Everyone told me you were dead.

1250
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,347
And if you were dead,

1251
00:55:03,714 --> 00:55:05,948
we had to have fresh capital,
heh, didn't we?

1252
00:55:05,981 --> 00:55:08,981
You, Ravello,
my own partner,

1253
00:55:09,015 --> 00:55:12,483
sneak up behind my back and-
And try to cheat me.

1254
00:55:12,516 --> 00:55:14,551
The milk's spilt.
It's no good crying over it.

1255
00:55:14,784 --> 00:55:16,983
Get after him, Billy.
Calm him down. Talk to him.

1256
00:55:17,017 --> 00:55:19,051
See if you can't get him
to change his attitude.

1257
00:55:19,185 --> 00:55:21,352
I'll try, but I don't think
it'll do any good.

1258
00:55:21,386 --> 00:55:23,719
I don't know why we have to
worry about Chelm's attitude.

1259
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:24,886
Talk's no good.

1260
00:55:25,153 --> 00:55:26,587
Conversation never
convinced anybody.

1261
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,720
I say, put an end
to words.

1262
00:55:27,754 --> 00:55:28,954
Shut up, Jack.

1263
00:55:29,087 --> 00:55:31,221
Time factor has entered
the picture again.

1264
00:55:31,254 --> 00:55:33,722
This time, fortunately,
it's working on our side.

1265
00:55:33,756 --> 00:55:35,789
Two weeks before we reach port,

1266
00:55:35,823 --> 00:55:39,056
that should be plenty of time
to convince our friend Chelm.

1267
00:55:39,089 --> 00:55:42,925
I beg you,
please end all this trouble.

1268
00:55:42,957 --> 00:55:44,090
If things go on,

1269
00:55:44,325 --> 00:55:45,559
either you will be
done away with

1270
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,091
before we ever get to Africa,

1271
00:55:47,592 --> 00:55:49,959
or you will live and denounce
Peterson to the authorities

1272
00:55:49,992 --> 00:55:53,761
and that will be the ruin
of all my plans and hopes.

1273
00:55:53,794 --> 00:55:55,394
In the long run
you'll do much better

1274
00:55:55,427 --> 00:55:56,628
to get clear of these people.

1275
00:55:56,829 --> 00:55:58,061
They're thoroughly undesirable.

1276
00:55:58,295 --> 00:56:01,696
The long run.
I'm tired of the long run.

1277
00:56:01,729 --> 00:56:05,464
I am not even thinking
about them or about myself.

1278
00:56:05,497 --> 00:56:08,631
It's only you
that concerns me, Harry.

1279
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:10,364
No need to worry
about me.

1280
00:56:10,398 --> 00:56:14,965
Ever since I met you,
you fill my thinking.

1281
00:56:14,998 --> 00:56:18,233
You are becoming an obsession.

1282
00:56:18,266 --> 00:56:20,701
Don't you understand, Harry?

1283
00:56:20,734 --> 00:56:24,802
I am deeply in love.

1284
00:56:24,836 --> 00:56:26,101
Maria.

1285
00:56:28,102 --> 00:56:29,369
My dear.

1286
00:56:41,539 --> 00:56:45,540
Only you could make
a woman feel like this.

1287
00:56:45,574 --> 00:56:51,175
All I want is to be
in your arms, now and always.

1288
00:56:51,209 --> 00:56:52,975
You forget I'm going
to be done away with.

1289
00:56:53,008 --> 00:56:54,043
Oh, no, no.

1290
00:56:54,076 --> 00:56:55,643
It will be easy to arrange.

1291
00:56:55,677 --> 00:56:57,176
What you must do is this:

1292
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:59,110
You will write me a letter.

1293
00:56:59,144 --> 00:57:00,678
A love letter.

1294
00:57:00,711 --> 00:57:02,946
You will tell me that you cannot
denounce Peterson

1295
00:57:02,978 --> 00:57:06,213
because then I will suffer too.

1296
00:57:06,246 --> 00:57:08,513
Because you love me so much,

1297
00:57:08,546 --> 00:57:11,347
you cannot bear to hurt me.

1298
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:12,714
Such a letter they will believe,

1299
00:57:12,747 --> 00:57:14,682
if I show it to them.

1300
00:57:14,715 --> 00:57:15,849
My dear girl, you must see

1301
00:57:16,281 --> 00:57:17,516
that this is quite
out of the question.

1302
00:57:17,683 --> 00:57:19,683
I don't propose
to make compromises.

1303
00:57:19,716 --> 00:57:22,584
Not compromises,
Harry, darling.

1304
00:57:22,617 --> 00:57:24,484
But you can see
if you cause trouble,

1305
00:57:24,517 --> 00:57:29,085
the whole of our plans,
my plans...

1306
00:57:29,118 --> 00:57:33,386
You would not want to make
the innocent suffer.

1307
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,687
It would be much better
if you don't interfere, Maria.

1308
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,888
I must handle this
as I see fit.

1309
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:40,422
Then you intend to go ahead
with this business,

1310
00:57:40,455 --> 00:57:42,589
tell stories
and ruin everything?

1311
00:57:42,622 --> 00:57:44,890
It'll be much better if you cut
loose from these people.

1312
00:57:44,923 --> 00:57:46,989
No happiness can come
from such an association.

1313
00:57:47,022 --> 00:57:49,891
Harry, I'm asking you
not to do this.

1314
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:52,825
Please write the letter,
then there will be no trouble

1315
00:57:52,859 --> 00:57:54,191
for you, no trouble for us.

1316
00:57:54,225 --> 00:57:56,359
No risk when we get to Africa.

1317
00:57:56,392 --> 00:57:57,759
I'm sorry, my dear,

1318
00:57:57,793 --> 00:57:59,560
we English are
a very pigheaded lot.

1319
00:57:59,594 --> 00:58:01,594
You think you can get away
with this?

1320
00:58:01,627 --> 00:58:04,061
But, Maria, my dear,
good Maria, listen.

1321
00:58:04,094 --> 00:58:07,362
First you make love to me, now
you tell me you will ruin me.

1322
00:58:07,395 --> 00:58:09,562
Heh. You'll forgive me,
but it was you who made, uh-

1323
00:58:09,596 --> 00:58:10,829
Oh, shut your trap!

1324
00:58:10,863 --> 00:58:12,497
Go on, do what you like.

1325
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,396
You think you're such
a brave man.

1326
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:16,598
I'll tell you what you are.

1327
00:58:16,631 --> 00:58:18,832
You are a heel.

1328
00:58:18,866 --> 00:58:20,232
Huh!

1329
00:58:20,265 --> 00:58:21,932
What the blazes now?

1330
00:58:21,966 --> 00:58:24,066
What's happening?
What's going on here?

1331
00:58:24,099 --> 00:58:26,099
Oil pump's on the blink.
Electricity's failed.

1332
00:58:26,132 --> 00:58:28,100
Utter folly, a ship lying
in darkness this way.

1333
00:58:28,133 --> 00:58:29,734
We might well be rammed
at any minute.

1334
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,068
I'll attend to this myself.
Which way is the engine room?

1335
00:58:32,101 --> 00:58:33,702
The passengers are not
permitted to-

1336
00:58:33,735 --> 00:58:35,236
I'm sure your chief engineer

1337
00:58:35,703 --> 00:58:37,736
would welcome the advice of an
ex-officer of the Royal Marines.

1338
00:58:52,907 --> 00:58:53,941
Look here, you fool.

1339
00:58:54,274 --> 00:58:55,541
Are we simply abandoned
to our fate?

1340
00:58:55,674 --> 00:58:56,975
I insist on something
being done.

1341
00:58:57,374 --> 00:58:58,876
For instance?
Well, give out the life belts.

1342
00:58:58,909 --> 00:59:00,675
Organize the boat drill.

1343
00:59:00,709 --> 00:59:03,276
The clientele are requested
to remain calm.

1344
00:59:03,309 --> 00:59:05,944
To remain calm. Did the captain
feel no sense of responsibility

1345
00:59:05,978 --> 00:59:07,410
for the lives of his passengers?

1346
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:08,878
It's my opinion
that the captain

1347
00:59:09,311 --> 00:59:10,678
doesn't feel much of anything
at the moment.

1348
00:59:10,812 --> 00:59:12,378
You mean to say he's drunk?

1349
00:59:12,578 --> 00:59:14,379
The fellow ought to be made
to walk the plank.

1350
00:59:14,412 --> 00:59:16,212
I'm afraid just now
he cannot walk at all.

1351
00:59:16,446 --> 00:59:18,213
But this is outrageous-
Oh, sit down, old man.

1352
00:59:18,247 --> 00:59:19,814
What have you got
to worry about?

1353
00:59:20,213 --> 00:59:22,181
We're only adrift in an open sea
with a drunken captain

1354
00:59:22,214 --> 00:59:24,482
and an engine that's liable
to explode at any moment.

1355
00:59:24,516 --> 00:59:26,482
Perfectly ordinary situation.

1356
00:59:26,516 --> 00:59:27,916
Happens every day.

1357
00:59:28,215 --> 00:59:31,316
But just in case any of you are
still at all anxious,

1358
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:32,985
let it be known that Mr. Chelm

1359
00:59:33,017 --> 00:59:34,918
has taken charge
in the engine room.

1360
00:59:34,951 --> 00:59:36,852
Who's taken charge?

1361
00:59:36,886 --> 00:59:39,285
Harry, and he'll foozle it
for sure.

1362
00:59:39,318 --> 00:59:40,920
Shall I get out the hymnbooks?

1363
00:59:41,253 --> 00:59:43,753
Your husband claims to have
learned all the about engines

1364
00:59:43,787 --> 00:59:47,020
and such things when he was
an officer in the Royal Marines.

1365
00:59:47,053 --> 00:59:48,488
If he ever was.

1366
00:59:48,522 --> 00:59:50,788
In point of fact,
not only was he an officer,

1367
00:59:50,822 --> 00:59:52,956
but he once won a medal
for jumping into a sea

1368
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:54,589
of fire to rescue someone.

1369
00:59:54,623 --> 00:59:56,757
It was only a bit of wreckage
and not a man,

1370
00:59:56,790 --> 00:59:58,323
but that wasn't
Harry's fault.

1371
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:00,258
Just a slight error
in judgment.

1372
01:00:03,158 --> 01:00:05,459
The lights. They come on.

1373
01:00:05,492 --> 01:00:07,193
He must have fixed it.

1374
01:00:07,226 --> 01:00:08,260
Impossible.

1375
01:00:08,426 --> 01:00:09,527
The engines are turning.

1376
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,760
We're under way.

1377
01:00:11,127 --> 01:00:12,394
I still say it's impossible.

1378
01:00:14,227 --> 01:00:16,228
Uh, ladies and, uh, gentlemen,

1379
01:00:16,262 --> 01:00:17,962
may I have your attention
for a moment.

1380
01:00:18,095 --> 01:00:19,663
I'm happy to inform you
that the oil pump

1381
01:00:19,763 --> 01:00:21,296
is now in perfect
working condition.

1382
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:23,197
Putting it right
was no great accomplishment

1383
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:25,264
for anyone with
the slightest mechanical bent.

1384
01:00:25,297 --> 01:00:27,298
Anyhow, we may now proceed
without further delay

1385
01:00:27,331 --> 01:00:28,632
and in absolute safety.

1386
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,866
Oh, Harry, you did, you did,
you foozled it.

1387
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,634
The pig who wrecked the ship!

1388
01:00:35,867 --> 01:00:37,333
Where is he?!
I'll tear out his gizzard!

1389
01:00:37,835 --> 01:00:40,368
Mr. Chelm, forward, please.
The captain wants to see you.

1390
01:00:40,401 --> 01:00:42,402
There you are. You devil.

1391
01:00:42,435 --> 01:00:43,702
You wreck my beautiful ship!

1392
01:00:43,736 --> 01:00:44,903
Nothing of the sort.

1393
01:00:45,202 --> 01:00:46,870
Some scalawag down there
sabotaged my work

1394
01:00:46,904 --> 01:00:48,303
out of pure malice!

1395
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:50,538
You explode my engine! I break
your bones, I kill you!

1396
01:00:50,771 --> 01:00:53,070
Keep your heads, boys. Let's
behave like little gentlemen.

1397
01:00:53,104 --> 01:00:55,372
Stay out of this, Dannreuther.
I can handle the brute.

1398
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:56,438
Let me at him.

1399
01:00:56,539 --> 01:00:57,573
What happens now?

1400
01:00:57,606 --> 01:00:59,706
Do we get the life belts?

1401
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:01,474
Do we abandon the ship?

1402
01:01:01,507 --> 01:01:03,140
There's no immediate danger.

1403
01:01:03,307 --> 01:01:05,375
The passengers will please
to return to the saloon.

1404
01:01:05,508 --> 01:01:07,909
We are heading for the nearest
port and there seems to be

1405
01:01:07,942 --> 01:01:10,075
some chance of our making it.

1406
01:01:10,109 --> 01:01:11,876
Great. Let's go.

1407
01:01:14,777 --> 01:01:16,011
Come along.

1408
01:01:19,711 --> 01:01:20,746
Now, who was last down?

1409
01:01:20,779 --> 01:01:21,779
Blast.

1410
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:27,713
Billy-Boy, be a good fellow
and make a fourth for Bridge.

1411
01:01:27,747 --> 01:01:29,447
The major has no head
for cards.

1412
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:31,180
A few rubbers
will soothe all our nerves.

1413
01:01:31,214 --> 01:01:32,448
No, thank you.

1414
01:01:32,615 --> 01:01:34,148
I'll soothe mine
with a double Scotch.

1415
01:01:34,282 --> 01:01:35,649
In fact, I think
I'll make it a triple.

1416
01:01:35,682 --> 01:01:36,750
No ice, no water.

1417
01:01:36,883 --> 01:01:37,850
Right, sir.

1418
01:01:38,182 --> 01:01:39,283
How about you,
Mrs. Dannreuther?

1419
01:01:39,316 --> 01:01:40,350
A little Bridge?

1420
01:01:40,384 --> 01:01:41,751
Oh, so sorry.

1421
01:01:41,784 --> 01:01:44,184
I have the most
fearful headache.

1422
01:01:44,218 --> 01:01:45,885
I think
I'll go to my cabin.

1423
01:01:49,352 --> 01:01:50,619
Oh, what a shame.

1424
01:01:51,052 --> 01:01:52,787
Well, boys, we'll have
to make it cutthroat.

1425
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:55,388
What about Harry, here?
Maybe he'll take a hand.

1426
01:01:55,421 --> 01:01:58,655
That, under the circumstances,
is a most unsuitable suggestion.

1427
01:01:58,688 --> 01:02:01,088
Gwendolen, I must ask you
to either move to another table

1428
01:02:01,122 --> 01:02:02,455
or else leave the saloon.

1429
01:02:02,489 --> 01:02:04,456
Oh, Harry, for heaven's sake.

1430
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:06,056
I don't care for my wife
to associate

1431
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:07,391
with an associate of criminals.

1432
01:02:07,424 --> 01:02:08,391
Don't be absurd.

1433
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:09,891
Billy's not a criminal.

1434
01:02:09,925 --> 01:02:11,959
He's the best friend
we have on this boat.

1435
01:02:11,992 --> 01:02:13,992
Well, we are not in need
of such friends.

1436
01:02:14,026 --> 01:02:15,860
You need any friends
you can get.

1437
01:02:15,893 --> 01:02:17,493
The only thing
standing between you

1438
01:02:17,626 --> 01:02:19,260
and a watery grave
is your wits,

1439
01:02:19,427 --> 01:02:21,661
and that's not my idea
of adequate protection.

1440
01:02:21,694 --> 01:02:24,495
Purser, how much longer
before this ship reaches port?

1441
01:02:24,528 --> 01:02:26,329
If we ever do get to port,
it should be

1442
01:02:26,362 --> 01:02:28,563
within 14 or 15 hours.

1443
01:02:28,596 --> 01:02:29,964
That's a long time.

1444
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:31,564
Sit down,
make yourself comfortable.

1445
01:02:31,597 --> 01:02:32,797
Have a drink.

1446
01:02:32,897 --> 01:02:35,164
Enjoy the major's
piano recital.

1447
01:02:35,197 --> 01:02:37,164
Come on, Peterson,
buy us a drink.

1448
01:02:37,431 --> 01:02:39,832
I'm afraid I can't accept
hospitality from persons who

1449
01:02:39,866 --> 01:02:43,166
I intend in a few hours time to
denounce in a place of justice.

1450
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,600
Two spades.

1451
01:02:44,633 --> 01:02:47,367
I admire your sang-froid,
Mr. Peterson,

1452
01:02:47,401 --> 01:02:49,201
or perhaps you don't think
I'm serious.

1453
01:02:49,235 --> 01:02:50,502
We shall see.

1454
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:52,468
Three clubs.

1455
01:02:54,037 --> 01:02:56,336
Gwendolen, are you going
to do as I say?

1456
01:02:56,369 --> 01:02:57,938
Not when you speak to me
in that tone.

1457
01:02:58,038 --> 01:02:59,671
Not when you try
to order me about.

1458
01:02:59,704 --> 01:03:00,772
In that case...

1459
01:03:00,972 --> 01:03:02,138
Where are you going?

1460
01:03:02,471 --> 01:03:04,104
On deck, where the air
is less polluted.

1461
01:03:09,907 --> 01:03:11,974
Purser. Four tonics.

1462
01:03:12,007 --> 01:03:13,708
I think you'd better
go after Harry.

1463
01:03:13,741 --> 01:03:15,042
Why should I?

1464
01:03:15,207 --> 01:03:17,142
If he's going to be
so childish and unreasonable.

1465
01:03:17,175 --> 01:03:20,677
Take my advice. Go to him.
Stay with him.

1466
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:22,977
I suppose you think
we should keep up appearances.

1467
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:25,644
The loyal wife
at her husband's side.

1468
01:03:25,678 --> 01:03:27,045
No, Billy.

1469
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:30,178
I'm experiencing something
that is rare and beautiful.

1470
01:03:30,211 --> 01:03:33,212
And I shall not deny it,
either by word or by deed.

1471
01:03:33,246 --> 01:03:34,246
I love you.

1472
01:03:34,279 --> 01:03:35,847
Let the whole world know it.

1473
01:03:35,881 --> 01:03:37,314
I love you. I love you.

1474
01:03:37,714 --> 01:03:40,415
Well, keeping up appearances
isn't exactly what I meant.

1475
01:03:40,448 --> 01:03:42,682
Then why do you want to send me
tagging after Harry?

1476
01:03:42,715 --> 01:03:44,316
He's being such
a deadly bore tonight.

1477
01:03:44,349 --> 01:03:46,950
Deadly, but not dead.
Not yet.

1478
01:03:46,983 --> 01:03:48,017
What do you mean?

1479
01:03:48,317 --> 01:03:49,450
They killed one man
just because

1480
01:03:49,917 --> 01:03:51,318
they thought he might try
to get in their way.

1481
01:03:51,484 --> 01:03:53,018
Now handsome Harry here
is threatening

1482
01:03:53,151 --> 01:03:54,685
to blow the whole thing
wide open.

1483
01:03:54,718 --> 01:03:56,319
- They killed a man?
- Uh-huh.

1484
01:03:56,352 --> 01:03:58,352
Really. Who?

1485
01:03:58,385 --> 01:04:01,219
Oh, just a man.

1486
01:04:01,253 --> 01:04:04,154
Well, for all Harry's
being too, too tiresome

1487
01:04:04,187 --> 01:04:06,220
and my loving you
to distraction,

1488
01:04:06,254 --> 01:04:09,589
I- I still wouldn't want
to see him done in.

1489
01:04:09,622 --> 01:04:12,122
He has some perfectly darling
traits, really.

1490
01:04:12,156 --> 01:04:15,390
I mean, like always
remembering one's birthday.

1491
01:04:15,424 --> 01:04:17,857
No, we simply mustn't
let anybody murder Harry.

1492
01:04:17,891 --> 01:04:20,358
Then keep him in your cabin.
Never let him out of your sight.

1493
01:04:20,391 --> 01:04:22,626
Keep him under lock and key.

1494
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,426
Oh, Billy.

1495
01:04:25,459 --> 01:04:26,994
That awful music.

1496
01:04:27,027 --> 01:04:29,928
It's so loud.
It comes right into our cabin.

1497
01:04:29,962 --> 01:04:33,796
Peterson, tell the major
to soft-pedal it.

1498
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:35,963
And while he's about it,
he might change the tune.

1499
01:04:35,996 --> 01:04:37,930
Oh, don't you like it?
It's one of my favorites.

1500
01:04:37,964 --> 01:04:40,430
I'm afraid he doesn't know
any others.

1501
01:04:40,463 --> 01:04:42,464
Do you, Jack?

1502
01:04:50,533 --> 01:04:51,566
Major.

1503
01:05:22,107 --> 01:05:23,608
Do I hear a lady screaming?

1504
01:05:24,642 --> 01:05:25,976
One down.

1505
01:05:29,242 --> 01:05:32,210
Captain, captain!

1506
01:05:46,246 --> 01:05:47,681
What happened?

1507
01:05:47,715 --> 01:05:49,247
Oh, Billy, all that screaming.

1508
01:05:49,281 --> 01:05:50,749
I thought someone
had been killed.

1509
01:05:50,782 --> 01:05:51,882
Well, someone nearly was.

1510
01:05:52,215 --> 01:05:53,382
Indeed they were.
Look at the major.

1511
01:05:53,415 --> 01:05:54,750
Better get a new act.

1512
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:56,316
The curtain's going down
on this one.

1513
01:05:56,717 --> 01:05:58,383
Every time I turn my back,
someone makes trouble.

1514
01:05:58,584 --> 01:06:00,684
They break the engine.
They beat each other with fists.

1515
01:06:00,718 --> 01:06:03,052
They throw each other overboard.
That man attacked me.

1516
01:06:03,086 --> 01:06:04,852
Ah, you. You again!

1517
01:06:04,885 --> 01:06:06,686
If I struck him,
it was in self-defense.

1518
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:09,553
He came sneaking up behind me
and tried to run me through.

1519
01:06:09,586 --> 01:06:10,554
Is that true?!

1520
01:06:10,587 --> 01:06:11,520
Well...

1521
01:06:11,554 --> 01:06:12,854
It's no use, Billy,

1522
01:06:13,021 --> 01:06:15,488
my trying to protect Harry
any further.

1523
01:06:15,521 --> 01:06:17,688
I may as well tell
the whole truth.

1524
01:06:17,722 --> 01:06:21,589
Captain, it- It grieves me
to confess this,

1525
01:06:21,623 --> 01:06:25,290
but in point of fact, my husband
has an illness of the mind.

1526
01:06:25,323 --> 01:06:28,491
The medical word for it
is paranoia.

1527
01:06:28,524 --> 01:06:32,325
On occasion, he displays
homicidal tendencies.

1528
01:06:32,359 --> 01:06:34,293
The psychiatrists say
it's because he-

1529
01:06:34,326 --> 01:06:36,760
He believes people
are plotting against him,

1530
01:06:36,793 --> 01:06:38,127
and so he strikes back

1531
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,527
and tries to kill them.

1532
01:06:39,661 --> 01:06:41,328
Gwendolen,
for heaven's sake, woman.

1533
01:06:41,362 --> 01:06:43,096
What's the meaning
of this treachery?

1534
01:06:43,495 --> 01:06:45,863
Believe it or not, Harry,
I'm doing it for your own good.

1535
01:06:45,896 --> 01:06:47,529
He knows.
He saved my life.

1536
01:06:47,563 --> 01:06:48,563
He'll tell the truth.

1537
01:06:48,864 --> 01:06:50,530
I wouldn't
contradict the lady.

1538
01:06:50,564 --> 01:06:51,564
You wreck my ship!

1539
01:06:51,764 --> 01:06:52,865
You try to kill the passengers.

1540
01:06:53,164 --> 01:06:54,531
Caruso!
But I'm the only sane person

1541
01:06:54,565 --> 01:06:55,732
on this ship!

1542
01:06:55,865 --> 01:06:57,199
That's why you're all
against me.

1543
01:06:57,532 --> 01:06:58,633
Let me go!
I'll kill the lot of you.

1544
01:06:58,666 --> 01:07:00,066
I warn you, captain!

1545
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,667
Poor Harry,
it's awfully sad.

1546
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:06,035
We've tried everything
to cure him.

1547
01:07:06,068 --> 01:07:07,668
How dare you lay hands on me!

1548
01:07:07,701 --> 01:07:08,902
You hooligans!

1549
01:07:08,936 --> 01:07:10,502
I'll have you put in irons.

1550
01:07:10,535 --> 01:07:12,070
You'll be the ones in irons.

1551
01:07:12,104 --> 01:07:14,104
Good, good.

1552
01:07:14,136 --> 01:07:16,671
We'll have
no more trouble from you.

1553
01:07:16,704 --> 01:07:18,738
Scum! Mongrels!

1554
01:07:18,771 --> 01:07:21,138
I'll bring you to book,
every one of you.

1555
01:07:21,171 --> 01:07:23,238
Every man jack of you!

1556
01:07:25,272 --> 01:07:27,607
After all,
it was the only solution.

1557
01:07:27,641 --> 01:07:29,641
Harry's safely locked
in his cabin,

1558
01:07:29,674 --> 01:07:32,208
where those beastly men
can't do him any harm.

1559
01:07:32,241 --> 01:07:34,875
On the other hand,
he can't say or do anything now

1560
01:07:34,908 --> 01:07:37,275
to interfere with your making
that fortune in Africa.

1561
01:07:37,309 --> 01:07:39,844
I- I mean, the authorities
would hardly listen

1562
01:07:39,877 --> 01:07:41,810
to the ravings of a lunatic,
would they?

1563
01:07:41,844 --> 01:07:44,211
Well, they won't even
let him off the boat.

1564
01:07:44,244 --> 01:07:45,544
Well, in that case,

1565
01:07:45,845 --> 01:07:47,846
he'll just have to stay
shut up for a few weeks.

1566
01:07:47,879 --> 01:07:50,113
A bit hard on the old boy,
don't you think?

1567
01:07:50,145 --> 01:07:53,146
Yes, but after you've amassed

1568
01:07:53,179 --> 01:07:56,314
all those African millions,
we'll make it up to him.

1569
01:07:56,347 --> 01:07:59,382
We'll buy him a country place
in Gloucestershire with-

1570
01:07:59,415 --> 01:08:02,650
With some rough shooting and-
And a trout stream,

1571
01:08:02,683 --> 01:08:04,583
like he's always wanted.

1572
01:08:04,616 --> 01:08:06,884
Maria will marry him,
perhaps.

1573
01:08:06,917 --> 01:08:09,118
She seems to have
a very real feeling

1574
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:11,052
for English country life.

1575
01:08:11,085 --> 01:08:13,551
And everybody lives
happily ever after.

1576
01:08:13,585 --> 01:08:14,986
Especially us, Billy.

1577
01:08:17,086 --> 01:08:18,186
Boat stations, everyone.

1578
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:19,286
Prepare to abandon ship.

1579
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:20,320
What's going on?

1580
01:08:20,587 --> 01:08:22,187
I believe, sir,
that we are sinking.

1581
01:08:22,221 --> 01:08:23,955
Boat stations, everybody.

1582
01:08:25,789 --> 01:08:27,023
We're sinking.

1583
01:08:28,255 --> 01:08:30,757
Harry, Harry.
Open the door.

1584
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:32,256
You must.
The ship's sinking.

1585
01:08:32,289 --> 01:08:33,724
Here, get back.

1586
01:09:53,711 --> 01:09:55,679
We simply can't leave
without finding out

1587
01:09:55,712 --> 01:09:57,012
what's happened to Harry.

1588
01:09:57,245 --> 01:09:58,513
Maybe we'll run across him
out there.

1589
01:09:58,780 --> 01:09:59,946
He's a strong swimmer,
isn't he?

1590
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:01,212
Do you really think we-?

1591
01:10:01,513 --> 01:10:03,213
I don't say we will.
But it's possible.

1592
01:10:03,247 --> 01:10:04,681
Anything's possible.

1593
01:10:17,384 --> 01:10:18,851
Harry!

1594
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:25,020
Harry!

1595
01:11:01,129 --> 01:11:02,595
Where do you suppose we are?

1596
01:11:02,629 --> 01:11:03,595
Africa.

1597
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:04,697
What part of Africa?

1598
01:11:04,963 --> 01:11:06,196
Yes, that's important.
What part?

1599
01:11:06,229 --> 01:11:07,463
Not a bad place to land.

1600
01:11:07,698 --> 01:11:09,230
No customs.
No forms to fill out.

1601
01:11:09,497 --> 01:11:11,832
Tell us at once where we are.
It's important I know.

1602
01:11:11,865 --> 01:11:14,099
You mean to say there are parts
of the dark continent

1603
01:11:14,231 --> 01:11:16,232
where you won't be received
like the prodigal son?

1604
01:11:16,266 --> 01:11:17,232
Arlio.

1605
01:11:17,266 --> 01:11:18,332
What's that?

1606
01:11:18,366 --> 01:11:19,600
Arlio.

1607
01:11:24,035 --> 01:11:25,668
Better get down,
everybody.

1608
01:11:25,935 --> 01:11:27,869
<i>Mamma mia, Arabs.
Oh, mamma mia.</i>

1609
01:11:27,903 --> 01:11:29,936
Get rid
of your passports, boys.

1610
01:11:29,969 --> 01:11:31,236
Mrs. Chelm, Billy-Boy,

1611
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:33,737
my identity must remain
a secret.

1612
01:12:19,315 --> 01:12:20,816
Arlio, what's that?

1613
01:12:20,917 --> 01:12:23,283
It was the company who sold arms
to the Arab Legions.

1614
01:12:23,316 --> 01:12:25,584
Wait a minute.
That rings a bell.

1615
01:12:25,617 --> 01:12:29,318
Some of the equipment
we sold them was defective.

1616
01:12:29,351 --> 01:12:31,985
Been too long under the water
in the Gulf of Leyte.

1617
01:12:32,019 --> 01:12:33,653
The Arabs claim
they lost the war

1618
01:12:33,853 --> 01:12:35,386
because of rusty guns
and dud ammunition.

1619
01:12:35,419 --> 01:12:36,654
For heaven's sake, be quiet.

1620
01:12:36,921 --> 01:12:38,220
If you go on like that,
I'll be-

1621
01:12:38,353 --> 01:12:40,388
I'll see you
drawn and quartered.

1622
01:13:01,493 --> 01:13:03,928
Are you going to allow them
to bully you in this way?

1623
01:13:03,961 --> 01:13:05,661
Why, i-it's simply-

1624
01:13:05,694 --> 01:13:06,861
Shocking.

1625
01:13:06,894 --> 01:13:08,595
Harry wouldn't have
let them do it.

1626
01:13:08,628 --> 01:13:10,428
He had a sense of dignity.

1627
01:13:10,462 --> 01:13:12,229
I have a sense of survival.

1628
01:13:12,262 --> 01:13:14,997
Billy, what is going
to happen?

1629
01:13:15,031 --> 01:13:16,764
Do you think
they will torture us?

1630
01:13:16,864 --> 01:13:19,698
Just let them try it.
I'm a British subject.

1631
01:13:19,732 --> 01:13:21,598
I wouldn't say it too loud.

1632
01:13:41,737 --> 01:13:43,671
We shipwreck.

1633
01:13:43,704 --> 01:13:48,705
Big boat go down bottom ocean.

1634
01:13:48,739 --> 01:13:52,140
We take little boat.

1635
01:13:52,173 --> 01:13:53,674
Row all day.

1636
01:13:55,174 --> 01:13:56,273
Row all night.

1637
01:13:56,307 --> 01:13:57,975
Savvy?

1638
01:13:58,008 --> 01:14:00,109
There's only one way
to deal with these swine.

1639
01:14:00,142 --> 01:14:01,809
Walk up and kick them
in the belly.

1640
01:14:01,843 --> 01:14:03,843
Show 'em who's boss
right away.

1641
01:14:03,876 --> 01:14:05,477
We sight land.

1642
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:06,910
Your land.

1643
01:14:06,944 --> 01:14:09,344
Praise Allah.

1644
01:14:09,377 --> 01:14:10,911
Come ashore.

1645
01:14:10,945 --> 01:14:13,779
Suddenly, boom, boom, boom.

1646
01:14:13,812 --> 01:14:16,278
No good way
treat shipwrecked people.

1647
01:14:16,312 --> 01:14:19,114
You will please
to hand over your passports.

1648
01:14:38,551 --> 01:14:40,886
There seem to be four missing.

1649
01:14:40,919 --> 01:14:43,652
Will those who have not
handed over their passports

1650
01:14:43,686 --> 01:14:45,820
hold up their hands?

1651
01:14:51,254 --> 01:14:54,655
All left on board ship,
Your Excellency.

1652
01:14:54,689 --> 01:14:55,757
A terrifying experience.

1653
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:57,256
An incompetent crew.

1654
01:14:57,289 --> 01:14:58,823
A burning ship.

1655
01:14:58,923 --> 01:15:01,491
Put overboard in a small boat
at dead of night.

1656
01:15:01,524 --> 01:15:03,091
What was the name
of the vessel?

1657
01:15:03,126 --> 01:15:04,425
<i>The S.S. Nyanga.</i>

1658
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:05,759
She's a Portuguese ship.

1659
01:15:05,992 --> 01:15:07,593
I will investigate
whether such a ship

1660
01:15:07,626 --> 01:15:09,426
has been reported
lost at sea.

1661
01:15:09,459 --> 01:15:11,460
Well, does it stand to reason,
Your Excellency,

1662
01:15:11,494 --> 01:15:13,393
we should come to this shore
in a small boat

1663
01:15:13,427 --> 01:15:14,928
if we'd not been shipwrecked?

1664
01:15:14,962 --> 01:15:17,795
Our country is
in a state of unrest.

1665
01:15:17,828 --> 01:15:19,130
Oh, I am sorry.

1666
01:15:19,163 --> 01:15:21,763
Agents of certain
foreign governments

1667
01:15:21,796 --> 01:15:24,797
sometimes try
to enter it by stealth-

1668
01:15:24,830 --> 01:15:25,930
Tsk-tsk.

1669
01:15:26,097 --> 01:15:28,664
- hoping to fan the flames
of revolution.

1670
01:15:28,698 --> 01:15:33,932
Therefore, we check carefully
on the activities of strangers.

1671
01:15:33,966 --> 01:15:36,134
But surely, Your Excellency,
in our case,

1672
01:15:36,167 --> 01:15:39,400
one look is sufficient to
convince you of our innocence.

1673
01:15:54,772 --> 01:15:57,038
No.

1674
01:15:57,072 --> 01:16:00,773
One look is not enough.

1675
01:16:05,374 --> 01:16:07,307
If you think we're
the enemies of your country,

1676
01:16:07,374 --> 01:16:09,308
the logical thing
is to boot us out.

1677
01:16:09,342 --> 01:16:11,675
Send us packing by the first
available boat or train.

1678
01:16:11,709 --> 01:16:13,144
We shan't object.

1679
01:16:13,177 --> 01:16:15,210
We've got important business
elsewhere.

1680
01:16:15,244 --> 01:16:16,911
Where is elsewhere?

1681
01:16:17,677 --> 01:16:18,844
Central Africa.

1682
01:16:19,744 --> 01:16:21,945
And what sort of business?

1683
01:16:21,979 --> 01:16:24,312
Vacuum cleaners.
Sewing machines.

1684
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:26,247
Ah, yes.

1685
01:16:26,279 --> 01:16:27,613
Businessmen.

1686
01:16:27,846 --> 01:16:31,148
All going to Central Africa
to sell vacuum cleaners.

1687
01:16:31,181 --> 01:16:32,249
Yes.

1688
01:16:32,281 --> 01:16:34,281
Hut to hut, I suppose.

1689
01:16:34,314 --> 01:16:36,216
And you, sir,
I take it,

1690
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:37,883
are the head salesman.

1691
01:16:37,916 --> 01:16:40,483
The ringleader of this group.

1692
01:16:40,517 --> 01:16:42,251
Oh, no. No group.

1693
01:16:42,283 --> 01:16:45,118
We met for the first time
onboard ship.

1694
01:16:45,152 --> 01:16:47,252
Complete strangers
to one another.

1695
01:16:47,284 --> 01:16:48,719
Liar!

1696
01:16:48,752 --> 01:16:51,119
The others all look at you
each time I ask a question.

1697
01:16:51,153 --> 01:16:53,787
I am a keen observer.

1698
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:55,354
You four are together.

1699
01:16:55,387 --> 01:16:57,621
Oh, no, my fat-gutted friend.

1700
01:16:57,654 --> 01:17:00,622
I am not the illiterate,
simple-minded native

1701
01:17:00,655 --> 01:17:02,388
you are fool enough
to take me for.

1702
01:17:02,421 --> 01:17:05,157
I am a great man.
A serious man.

1703
01:17:05,190 --> 01:17:06,656
I spit on you.
Phew.

1704
01:17:06,689 --> 01:17:09,490
I spit on you
and all your lies.

1705
01:17:09,524 --> 01:17:11,192
Off to the wrong start,
Peterson.

1706
01:17:11,458 --> 01:17:13,625
There's only one way
to deal with these swine.

1707
01:17:13,658 --> 01:17:16,359
Swine, swine, swine!

1708
01:17:16,392 --> 01:17:18,393
You'd better be careful.

1709
01:17:18,426 --> 01:17:20,994
My husband, my late husband,
who was drowned

1710
01:17:21,027 --> 01:17:22,327
in the Nyanga disaster,

1711
01:17:22,728 --> 01:17:24,327
happened to be one
of the most important figures

1712
01:17:24,361 --> 01:17:25,494
in the British government.

1713
01:17:25,528 --> 01:17:26,896
Sir Harry Chelm.

1714
01:17:26,929 --> 01:17:28,996
In point of fact,
we had letters

1715
01:17:29,029 --> 01:17:30,897
from the prime minister
and the queen

1716
01:17:30,930 --> 01:17:32,264
telling everybody

1717
01:17:32,530 --> 01:17:35,064
to be particularly courteous
to us and our friends.

1718
01:17:35,098 --> 01:17:38,132
So you see, if any harm
befalls us at your hands,

1719
01:17:38,166 --> 01:17:40,565
it will become
a major international incident.

1720
01:17:40,598 --> 01:17:44,766
Would you instruct that one,
that in my country,

1721
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:49,235
a female's lips may move,
but her words are not heard.

1722
01:17:49,269 --> 01:17:51,535
Oh, Harry, Harry...

1723
01:17:53,369 --> 01:17:55,469
if only you were here.

1724
01:17:56,903 --> 01:18:00,805
And now, sir, you will
stop abusing my intelligence

1725
01:18:00,838 --> 01:18:02,771
and tell me who you really are

1726
01:18:02,805 --> 01:18:05,872
and what is your actual purpose
in being here.

1727
01:18:05,906 --> 01:18:07,806
I'm a sick man.
I've got a bad heart.

1728
01:18:07,839 --> 01:18:08,973
I mustn't talk any more.

1729
01:18:09,007 --> 01:18:11,040
You refuse to answer.

1730
01:18:11,073 --> 01:18:12,407
That is interesting.

1731
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,474
It makes of it
a contest.

1732
01:18:14,507 --> 01:18:17,975
A contest in a game
at which we excel.

1733
01:18:18,042 --> 01:18:22,342
We of this country have had
4000 years' experience

1734
01:18:22,376 --> 01:18:25,777
in asking questions
and getting answers.

1735
01:18:26,844 --> 01:18:28,678
Who are you?

1736
01:18:28,711 --> 01:18:30,978
Why are you here?

1737
01:18:31,012 --> 01:18:32,280
Don't hit me again.

1738
01:18:32,379 --> 01:18:34,412
My heart,
I'll have an attack.

1739
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:03,954
Of course, Billy's lead
a thoroughly decadent life.

1740
01:19:03,987 --> 01:19:06,688
I must say, I thought
he had more backbone than that.

1741
01:19:06,721 --> 01:19:10,255
Backbone, hm, either you have it
or you haven't.

1742
01:19:10,289 --> 01:19:11,956
Did you see
the beating I took

1743
01:19:12,455 --> 01:19:15,523
at the hands of that great ugly
brute without even flinching?

1744
01:19:15,557 --> 01:19:17,490
Billy was crazed with fear
before they'd even

1745
01:19:17,523 --> 01:19:18,624
laid a finger on him.

1746
01:19:20,691 --> 01:19:23,059
Tell me more
about Rita Hayworth.

1747
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:25,026
You really know her very well?

1748
01:19:25,059 --> 01:19:26,093
Do I know Rita?

1749
01:19:27,127 --> 01:19:28,493
Do I know her.

1750
01:19:28,526 --> 01:19:30,061
I'll give you
a letter of introduction.

1751
01:19:30,594 --> 01:19:32,527
She'll fall an immediate victim
to your charms.

1752
01:19:32,561 --> 01:19:33,494
You really think so?

1753
01:19:33,528 --> 01:19:34,962
Oh, but certainly.

1754
01:19:34,995 --> 01:19:36,196
A man like you:

1755
01:19:36,328 --> 01:19:40,596
suave, intelligent,
darkly handsome.

1756
01:19:40,629 --> 01:19:43,363
You have everything, Ahmed,
except money.

1757
01:19:43,397 --> 01:19:47,498
And if you listen to me, a boat
will be placed at our disposal.

1758
01:19:47,531 --> 01:19:48,999
A very slow boat.

1759
01:19:49,266 --> 01:19:52,033
So that fat gut's check will
have plenty of time to clear.

1760
01:19:52,066 --> 01:19:53,900
And you will trust me
for your share?

1761
01:19:55,034 --> 01:19:56,901
Does one man of the world
ask another

1762
01:19:56,935 --> 01:19:58,367
to trust his own brother?

1763
01:19:58,401 --> 01:20:00,101
Oh, no, Ahmed.

1764
01:20:00,135 --> 01:20:01,836
You'll give me a check for half.

1765
01:20:01,969 --> 01:20:05,736
Your demands are very great
under the circumstances.

1766
01:20:05,770 --> 01:20:07,103
Well, why shouldn't
they be?

1767
01:20:07,204 --> 01:20:09,205
Fat gut's my best friend.

1768
01:20:09,238 --> 01:20:10,971
I will not betray him cheaply.

1769
01:20:11,171 --> 01:20:14,105
You are certain that you are
the friend of the peerless Rita?

1770
01:20:14,139 --> 01:20:15,405
Come, come, Ahmed,

1771
01:20:15,438 --> 01:20:17,372
mind back to business.

1772
01:20:18,706 --> 01:20:19,639
Very well.

1773
01:20:19,673 --> 01:20:21,740
Fifty-fifty.
Oh, uh,

1774
01:20:21,774 --> 01:20:24,741
by the way, fat gut's nature
isn't noble like ours.

1775
01:20:24,775 --> 01:20:26,175
He might try to bargain.

1776
01:20:26,309 --> 01:20:28,876
I do not bargain
with a puffball like that.

1777
01:20:28,909 --> 01:20:30,709
It's beneath my dignity.

1778
01:20:30,742 --> 01:20:32,810
It'll be dawn soon.

1779
01:20:32,844 --> 01:20:34,177
The correct hour

1780
01:20:34,211 --> 01:20:35,411
for a firing squad.

1781
01:20:35,744 --> 01:20:38,511
But if we have him shot,
what about the money?

1782
01:20:38,544 --> 01:20:39,879
Well, I was just thinking

1783
01:20:40,345 --> 01:20:42,979
that if he heard a volley
at the psychological moment,

1784
01:20:43,012 --> 01:20:45,113
he might not be
so inclined to haggle.

1785
01:20:45,147 --> 01:20:49,181
I believe you must
have Arab blood.

1786
01:20:49,215 --> 01:20:52,882
Westerners are not
usually so subtle.

1787
01:21:05,252 --> 01:21:06,619
Where are you taking me?

1788
01:21:06,786 --> 01:21:09,452
I won't go.
I demand to see a doctor.

1789
01:21:09,485 --> 01:21:15,322
Would you say that in Paris,
among smart people...

1790
01:21:15,354 --> 01:21:21,355
the Rolls-Royce or the Cadillac
is considered more chic?

1791
01:21:22,556 --> 01:21:23,556
Well, that's no problem.

1792
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:24,823
No problem at all.

1793
01:21:24,857 --> 01:21:25,891
A man in your position

1794
01:21:25,924 --> 01:21:27,591
should have both.

1795
01:21:27,624 --> 01:21:28,657
Ah...

1796
01:21:34,359 --> 01:21:38,360
Mr. Dannreuther, I believe,
would like a word with you.

1797
01:21:38,927 --> 01:21:39,961
Billy.

1798
01:21:39,994 --> 01:21:41,962
Sit down, Peterson.

1799
01:21:48,864 --> 01:21:50,030
Uh...

1800
01:21:50,064 --> 01:21:52,831
I've been talking
to Ahmed here and, uh...

1801
01:21:59,132 --> 01:22:01,933
It's blackmail.

1802
01:22:01,967 --> 01:22:03,300
I can't pay.

1803
01:22:08,435 --> 01:22:09,735
What was that?

1804
01:22:09,768 --> 01:22:12,036
Firing squad.

1805
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:13,703
It's execution day.

1806
01:22:15,937 --> 01:22:17,737
Will he take a check?

1807
01:22:44,477 --> 01:22:45,510
Billy.

1808
01:22:47,079 --> 01:22:49,145
Billy, look.

1809
01:22:49,179 --> 01:22:50,279
<i>The Nyanga.</i>

1810
01:22:55,348 --> 01:22:56,780
Stay away!

1811
01:22:56,814 --> 01:22:58,381
Stay away from my ship!

1812
01:22:58,414 --> 01:23:01,148
If you try to come aboard,
I will shoot you!

1813
01:23:01,182 --> 01:23:02,749
I will shoot you!

1814
01:23:02,782 --> 01:23:05,849
Get my gun! Get my gun!

1815
01:23:05,883 --> 01:23:08,783
Give it to him.
Maybe he'll shoot himself.

1816
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:11,352
My gun, my gun!

1817
01:23:27,089 --> 01:23:28,922
Excuse me, are you
Mr. William Dannreuther?

1818
01:23:28,955 --> 01:23:30,223
That's right.

1819
01:23:30,257 --> 01:23:31,723
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

1820
01:23:31,756 --> 01:23:33,157
I'm sorry, not now.

1821
01:23:33,191 --> 01:23:34,790
Forgive me,
but it's rather important.

1822
01:23:34,824 --> 01:23:35,891
Yes, it always is.

1823
01:23:36,124 --> 01:23:37,758
I was a newspaper man
myself once.

1824
01:23:37,791 --> 01:23:39,391
Very well, you may quote me
as saying

1825
01:23:39,758 --> 01:23:41,559
that everybody was heroic
except Mrs. Dannreuther,

1826
01:23:41,592 --> 01:23:43,059
who ate all our boots.

1827
01:23:43,093 --> 01:23:44,927
Very amusing, but, uh,
I'm not a reporter.

1828
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:46,127
Oh?

1829
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:48,393
Jack, go to the phone.
Make reservations.

1830
01:23:48,426 --> 01:23:50,728
The first plane to Nairobi.
Six seats.

1831
01:23:50,761 --> 01:23:52,996
Yes, and if they don't have any,
talk to the right man

1832
01:23:53,129 --> 01:23:55,263
and tell him if he kicks
other people off the plane,

1833
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:56,863
we'll make it worth
his while.

1834
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:58,496
I always said
we ought to take a plane.

1835
01:23:58,796 --> 01:24:00,298
You remember I said that,
Mr. O'Horror.

1836
01:24:00,697 --> 01:24:02,797
- I said we ought to take a plane.
- Mustn't dawdle, Billy-Boy.

1837
01:24:02,831 --> 01:24:04,332
Great deal to do
and not much time.

1838
01:24:04,665 --> 01:24:05,999
Those the other members
of your party?

1839
01:24:06,132 --> 01:24:07,966
- Yes.
- I'd like to talk to them too.

1840
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,333
Well, what's it all about?

1841
01:24:09,367 --> 01:24:10,699
I believe you were acquainted

1842
01:24:10,933 --> 01:24:12,967
with a Mr. Vanmeer,
now deceased.

1843
01:24:14,901 --> 01:24:16,168
Peterson.

1844
01:24:16,202 --> 01:24:18,168
You and the boys
better come back down.

1845
01:24:18,202 --> 01:24:20,169
There's a gentleman here
wants to speak to you.

1846
01:24:20,203 --> 01:24:22,103
A Mr. Jack Clayton
of Scotland Yard.

1847
01:24:22,203 --> 01:24:24,670
You take your wine here
or upstairs, Mr. Dann?

1848
01:24:24,703 --> 01:24:26,104
Oh, we'll have it here.

1849
01:24:26,271 --> 01:24:27,671
Care to join us in a drink,
Clayton?

1850
01:24:28,071 --> 01:24:29,604
No, thanks. It's a bit early
in the day for me.

1851
01:24:29,638 --> 01:24:31,805
I read somewhere
that a Scotland Yard man

1852
01:24:31,839 --> 01:24:34,705
never accepts a drink from
anyone he intends to arrest.

1853
01:24:34,739 --> 01:24:36,140
Is that true, Mr. Clayton?

1854
01:24:36,173 --> 01:24:38,207
- Quite so.
- Mrs. Dannreuther?

1855
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,275
No. I'm Mrs. Chelm.

1856
01:24:40,308 --> 01:24:42,241
This is Mrs. Dannreuther.

1857
01:24:42,275 --> 01:24:43,742
Well, how do you do?

1858
01:24:43,942 --> 01:24:45,975
Well, I wouldn't dream
of alarming you lovely ladies,

1859
01:24:46,009 --> 01:24:48,110
so perhaps I'll have
a glass of bubbly after all.

1860
01:24:49,442 --> 01:24:50,410
Peterson.

1861
01:24:50,443 --> 01:24:51,443
How do you do, sir?

1862
01:24:51,477 --> 01:24:52,677
How do you do?

1863
01:24:52,777 --> 01:24:56,145
Ravello. Heh.
And, uh, Mr. O'Horror.

1864
01:24:56,178 --> 01:24:57,811
O'Hara. Julius O'Hara.

1865
01:24:57,845 --> 01:24:58,812
Delighted.

1866
01:24:58,846 --> 01:25:00,512
I'm the one to be delighted.

1867
01:25:00,545 --> 01:25:01,812
It had begun to look as though

1868
01:25:02,114 --> 01:25:03,281
I'd never catch up
with you people

1869
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:05,147
and that would have been
a bit embarrassing.

1870
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:06,848
You see, this is the first time

1871
01:25:06,881 --> 01:25:09,081
I've ever been abroad
on an investigation.

1872
01:25:09,115 --> 01:25:11,049
I've spent quite a lot of money,

1873
01:25:11,082 --> 01:25:12,615
and my chief can be
very sarcastic

1874
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:13,917
about the money one spends,

1875
01:25:14,416 --> 01:25:16,317
particularly if you fail
to deliver the goods.

1876
01:25:16,350 --> 01:25:18,450
Mr. Clayton
is presently interested

1877
01:25:18,484 --> 01:25:20,218
in the Vanmeer murder case.

1878
01:25:20,251 --> 01:25:22,085
The Vanmeer murder case.

1879
01:25:22,119 --> 01:25:24,585
Oh, yes, yes, that fellow
in the Colonial Office.

1880
01:25:24,618 --> 01:25:26,320
Yes, I read about that
in the paper.

1881
01:25:26,353 --> 01:25:27,920
It was a shocking affair.

1882
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:29,854
According to Mr. Vanmeer's
appointment book,

1883
01:25:30,121 --> 01:25:32,520
Mr. Peterson, you had lunch
with him at the Savoy

1884
01:25:32,553 --> 01:25:33,922
a few days before his death.

1885
01:25:33,955 --> 01:25:35,355
That's quite correct.

1886
01:25:35,454 --> 01:25:37,989
Mr. Vanmeer was expert
on African matters.

1887
01:25:38,023 --> 01:25:40,290
We wanted his advice
about affairs

1888
01:25:40,323 --> 01:25:41,556
in British East.

1889
01:25:41,723 --> 01:25:43,224
Recall the subject
under discussion?

1890
01:25:43,257 --> 01:25:44,224
Vaguely.

1891
01:25:44,257 --> 01:25:45,724
Uh, crop yield.

1892
01:25:45,758 --> 01:25:47,591
The native labor situation.

1893
01:25:47,624 --> 01:25:48,792
Inches of rain.

1894
01:25:48,825 --> 01:25:50,892
Vaccination shots. Heh.

1895
01:25:50,926 --> 01:25:52,826
How long had you known
Mr. Vanmeer?

1896
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:55,294
Oh, a couple of months.
We met half a dozen times.

1897
01:25:55,459 --> 01:25:58,328
Did he ever make mention of any
enemies, business or otherwise?

1898
01:25:58,361 --> 01:26:00,428
Did he say anything
about romantic attachments?

1899
01:26:00,461 --> 01:26:01,995
I mean, did he name any women?

1900
01:26:02,029 --> 01:26:03,329
No.

1901
01:26:03,362 --> 01:26:05,429
I should have been
very surprised if he had done.

1902
01:26:05,729 --> 01:26:08,164
Mr. Vanmeer struck me as being
every inch a gentleman.

1903
01:26:08,197 --> 01:26:09,697
Oh, of course, of course.

1904
01:26:09,730 --> 01:26:12,564
Well, uh, that's all,

1905
01:26:12,598 --> 01:26:14,698
unless somebody has anything
further to add?

1906
01:26:16,166 --> 01:26:17,199
I have.

1907
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:22,533
I think you ought to know

1908
01:26:22,566 --> 01:26:25,235
that the business of one
of these businessmen is murder.

1909
01:26:26,701 --> 01:26:28,303
I beg your pardon?

1910
01:26:28,336 --> 01:26:30,369
Major Ross, I mean.

1911
01:26:30,403 --> 01:26:34,037
I can't guarantee Major Ross
murdered this Vanmeer person.

1912
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:35,405
I assure you, however,

1913
01:26:35,437 --> 01:26:37,338
he attempted to murder
my husband

1914
01:26:37,504 --> 01:26:40,205
with a long, thin dagger,
which he always carried about

1915
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:42,806
in what looked like
an innocent swagger stick.

1916
01:26:42,839 --> 01:26:44,673
Go on, Mrs. Chelm.

1917
01:26:44,839 --> 01:26:48,074
You see, Major Ross is
employed by Mr. Peterson there

1918
01:26:48,107 --> 01:26:49,840
to do his dirty work.

1919
01:26:49,874 --> 01:26:52,075
One might say
he's a professional killer.

1920
01:26:52,108 --> 01:26:55,243
My husband found out certain
things about Mr. Peterson.

1921
01:26:55,276 --> 01:26:58,576
Things, in point of fact,
that are a matter of empire,

1922
01:26:58,610 --> 01:27:00,344
involving as they do,
a plot to exploit

1923
01:27:00,377 --> 01:27:02,477
our kingdom's
uranium resources.

1924
01:27:02,511 --> 01:27:04,378
And that's why
Mr. Peterson decided

1925
01:27:04,412 --> 01:27:05,779
to have him done away with.

1926
01:27:05,879 --> 01:27:07,413
Don't run away,
Mr. Peterson.

1927
01:27:07,745 --> 01:27:10,347
That's always tantamount
to a confession of guilt.

1928
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:12,247
"Can't amount"
is what I call it.

1929
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:14,847
More champagne, Clayton?

1930
01:27:14,881 --> 01:27:15,948
No, thank you.

1931
01:27:33,053 --> 01:27:37,520
<i>As I said before,
very smart fellows indeed.</i>

1932
01:27:40,054 --> 01:27:42,854
Should you ever
think of me in Earls Court,

1933
01:27:42,888 --> 01:27:44,289
that's where I'll be,

1934
01:27:44,455 --> 01:27:46,789
helping Harry's parents
with the lodgers.

1935
01:27:46,822 --> 01:27:48,489
Should you ever think of me,

1936
01:27:48,523 --> 01:27:52,490
try not to let it be
too harshly.

1937
01:27:52,524 --> 01:27:54,258
You kiss her too, Billy.

1938
01:27:54,291 --> 01:27:56,125
And tell her
she's forgiven.

1939
01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:57,992
Sure, sure.

1940
01:27:58,025 --> 01:27:59,826
Goodbye, Billy.

1941
01:27:59,859 --> 01:28:00,859
Bye.

1942
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:06,694
For Mrs. Chelm.

1943
01:28:06,727 --> 01:28:08,561
Just came over ship's wire.

1944
01:28:09,761 --> 01:28:11,629
Oh, by the way,
Mr. Dannreuther,

1945
01:28:11,662 --> 01:28:15,563
do you know that your associates
are all in hoosegow?

1946
01:28:15,596 --> 01:28:17,663
Oh, not that
I'm a bit surprised.

1947
01:28:17,697 --> 01:28:19,864
I put them down
as thoroughly bad characters.

1948
01:28:19,898 --> 01:28:21,265
Right off the bat.

1949
01:28:21,564 --> 01:28:24,732
But then there are so many
bad characters nowadays.

1950
01:28:24,765 --> 01:28:26,299
Take mine, for instance.

1951
01:28:27,633 --> 01:28:29,067
Harry!

1952
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:30,701
He's alive!

1953
01:28:42,438 --> 01:28:44,271
Oh...

1954
01:29:07,143 --> 01:29:09,877
Oh, this is the end.

1955
01:29:13,678 --> 01:29:15,179
The end.
