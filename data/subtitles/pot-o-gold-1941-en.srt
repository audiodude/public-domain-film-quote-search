1
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,480
Hello, Mrs Simmons...Mary.
Hello, Mr Haskel.

2
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,520
Here's your shirt, Jimmy.
I turned the cuffs. Thanks.

3
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,400
Little enough for letting Mary
practise here. Oh, it's all right.

4
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,760
How is she doing? Encourage her.
If she practises, she'll be good.

5
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,480
I'll be back in an hour.
OK. I'll take good care of her.

6
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,040
Hop to it, Mary.

7
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,680
Mary, give me an "A", please.

8
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,120
That's it. OK, thanks.

9
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,440
When are you going to get new
records? You haven't worn out those.

10
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,960
Won't be long now.

11
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,160
Hi, Tommy. Tomatoes for my last
lesson. Tomorrow, I'll bring bacon.

12
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,840
OK, here's your horn. I think
you left your music over there.

13
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,720
Uncle Charlie, glad to see you!
Jimmy, I'm glad to see you, too.

14
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,760
What brings you here? I came
because you didn't answer my letter.

15
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,040
I wanted time to think it over.
Come in, Uncle Charlie.

16
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,080
I...I wrote you...

17
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,600
I wrote you three months ago!

18
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,120
Was it that long? You know
how it is, a fella gets busy.

19
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,160
With these things, you have to
change the oil every thousand miles.

20
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,360
Jimmy! Jimmy!

21
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,400
I came up to have an important talk
with you. Go ahead. I'm listening.

22
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,160
Can't we go some place
without this infernal racket?!

23
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,680
Yeah. We'll go in my room.

24
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,200
Where? Right over there.

25
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,360
Here we are.

26
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,040
That chair needs fixing. It's
a trade for a second-hand clarinet.

27
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,080
Jimmy, I'm not going to
beat around the bush.

28
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,120
As you know, we've not been close.

29
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,160
After all, we are the last of
the Haskels. Is that very serious?

30
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,680
I want to keep the name of Haskel
in the health-food business.

31
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,200
I understand. I want to keep
our name in the music business.

32
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,720
I'm talking about BIG business.
Can't you understand?

33
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,720
I need you, Jimmy. Some day, you're
going to get everything I've got.

34
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,280
But you won't get it if you fritter
your life away in this town.

35
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,800
This whistle stop.

36
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,040
I like it here.
My dad was happy here.

37
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,800
I could never understand my brother.

38
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,320
I told him when he opened this place
he'd never make a go of it.

39
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,600
It failed successfully for 25 years.
That's not bad.

40
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,440
If he'd listened to me,
he'd have been a rich man. But, no.

41
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,320
What did he have when he died? The
biggest funeral this town ever saw.

42
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,920
Everybody was there.
Everybody owed him money. Maybe so.

43
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:26,720
Dad had a wonderful time living.
He liked hunting, fishing, music.

44
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,160
Music!
He talked a great deal about you.

45
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,240
He did?
Always seemed to feel sorry for you.

46
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,160
Sorry?! You didn't get anything
out of life. Just making money.

47
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,680
Is that so? Since when has
making money been a crime?

48
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,040
I'm not going to argue with you. And
I'm not going to get upset. No, sir!

49
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,560
Jimmy! Jimmy!

50
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,080
Uncle, I'm sorry.

51
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,120
Don't hit him. He's an old man.
It was the chair.

52
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,760
Are you hurt? Don't mind me.

53
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,000
Hello, Bud. Can I talk to you?
Yeah, outside here.

54
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,040
Excuse me a minute, Uncle Charlie.

55
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,560
Afraid I've got some bad news.
What's the trouble, Bud?

56
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm to take up this attachment
unless you've got money.

57
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,720
Take it up. Unless you think eggs
are gonna go up to 500 a dozen.

58
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,920
See what you can do. I'll hold this
off as long as I can. Thanks, Bud.

59
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,428
He was just telling me
about some people

60
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,160
that wanted musical instruments.

61
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,200
He's the sheriff. How do you know?
I knew his father.

62
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,240
He was serving a paper on your
father the first time I was here.

63
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,336
Well, you can stay here chasing
rainbows

64
00:06:51,338 --> 00:06:54,280
or I can show you
a real pot of gold.

65
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,960
I...I... Wait. That's a good idea
for my radio show tomorrow night.

66
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,480
You've heard my Happiness Hour
of course. Everybody's heard it.

67
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,120
Once. Listen to this.

68
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,960
Clouds that make the day so grey
must sooner or later pass away.

69
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:17,000
There's a pot of gold at the end
of the rainbow. Homespun philosophy.

70
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,440
Oh, boy.

71
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,560
I've got to be going.
What are you going to do?

72
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,053
Unless a miracle happens in
the next few days,

73
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:31,080
looks like I'll
slide right down that rainbow. Fine.

74
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,240
And land right in the pot.

75
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,640
What was I saying? And furthermore...

76
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,160
And furthermore, I see no reason...

77
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,200
What was I saying? And furthermore...

78
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:58,240
I see no reason to change the air
guns we use to puff rice and cereals.

79
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,280
Our air guns are exceptionally quiet.

80
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,320
I therefore would suggest...

81
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,880
There goes that band again.

82
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,400
Oh, I'll settle this.

83
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,400
How can a man transact business
with that going on?

84
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,920
Tom-toms, jungle screeches.
They're a menace to sanity.

85
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,960
What did I say? Tom-toms and jungle
screeches. No, that's what I mean.

86
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,375
The McCorkles took that band in
to annoy me.

87
00:08:39,376 --> 00:08:42,480
That's why
they've ignored my protests.

88
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,520
It's a new band. Who wants a new
band? Let them do it in a cave.

89
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,560
Boom-boom-boom-boom-boom!
Walawalawala!

90
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,080
I'll settle this once and for all.

91
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,800
Hey! Hey!

92
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,440
You! Hey!

93
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,920
Hey, you! Somebody, hey!

94
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,120
< Hey! Hey!
What's the matter?

95
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,400
Stop that blasted bedlam
or I'll have it stopped!

96
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,640
Oh, you will, eh? You and who else?

97
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,400
The police! I'll have them thrown
in jail for disturbing the peace.

98
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,120
Disturbing the peace?

99
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,600
What about that air gun
booming all day and night?

100
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,520
I suppose that's a baby's lullaby,
you white-headed old baboon.

101
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,200
That boom is this business.
Besides, we're all used to it.

102
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,480
The band is business. You can get
used to it. I'll get an injunction.

103
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,400
Oh, you will, eh? Listen,
you black-hearted old skinflint.

104
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,440
You want me to sell my house
so you can enlarge your factory.

105
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,640
I'm not selling. Not at your price.

106
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,160
Call the cops if you think
you can have this band thrown out.

107
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,240
You just wait! You'll find out!

108
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,840
Go ahead, boys. Go to it, but loud.

109
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,360
Jasper. Go and get Jasper.

110
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,880
Jasper! Jasper!

111
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,320
Find him.
Don't stand there like a dummy.

112
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,000
Do I have to do everything? Jasper!

113
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,040
Do you want me, CJ? Why aren't
you here when I need you?

114
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,080
Get the police. The police?
The militia if necessary.

115
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,880
That woman has insulted me for the
last time. You said that before.

116
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,920
This time I mean it.
That band is driving me insane.

117
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,600
It certainly is. Have them arrested.

118
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,120
I will. Good.

119
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,560
# Hi, Si, what's a-cooking?
Hi, Si, how's she looking?

120
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,360
# Life will be as sweet as can be

121
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,880
# If I find a cookie
that's looking for me

122
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,640
# Hi, Si, di-di-dida,
di-di da-da da da da-da

123
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,640
# All day long I wash and dry
To keep my cookie away from Shanghai

124
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,320
# Shine for you?
Ten cents implies a revenue

125
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,640
# Your dogs will get a real shampoo
The real Magoo

126
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,680
< Fresh fish!

127
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,600
# Dum-dee dum-doo diddly-dum

128
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,640
# The fortune teller told me
I was gonna clean up. #

129
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,520
The apples good? I supply the Ritz.
They'll do for the McCorkles.

130
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,040
I'll take half a dozen.

131
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,080
Here, Willy.
What am I? A packhorse?

132
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,600
Anything else, Miss Molly?
That'll be all. Thank you.

133
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,400
Here, stupid. Well, take it.

134
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,080
Thank you.

135
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:12,720
Come on. Too bad you can't carry
a few bundles without complaining.

136
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,400
I don't mind carrying them.

137
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,880
Well, who are you?
I'm the guy carrying the bundle.

138
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,920
Thanks. I thought my brother
Willy was behind me.

139
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,760
He went ahead of you. I'm terribly
sorry. You must have been surprised.

140
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,600
Life in the city is one surprise
after another. For instance?

141
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,440
Band music coming down out of
the sky. That's up on our roof.

142
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,280
On your roof? The band is on
the house, until we get a job.

143
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,120
Are you with the band? My sister
Donna and I sing. Mother feeds it.

144
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,640
It certainly is a swell band.
Not everyone agrees with that.

145
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,160
You mean the neighbours object?
No. The neighbours are...

146
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,680
Uh-oh. Here comes trouble.

147
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,720
As you can see, Miss McCorkle,
I'm here with the law.

148
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,840
For protection?
No. This is your last warning.

149
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,920
That music must cease!
< I'm coming, Molly.

150
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,640
What does this weasel want?
As if I didn't know. No violence.

151
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,520
Speak to her, officer.
Hello, Mom.

152
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,560
You're in bad company.
I'm here to give you an ultimatum.

153
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,600
That band are disturbing
the entire neighbourhood.

154
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,120
The entire neighbourhood? Does
it disturb you, Mrs Papadalis?

155
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,800
No. It keeps me young. Disturbing
the peace. And you, Mrs Sweeney?

156
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,520
My old man can't fight
when he hears music.

157
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,880
They will, will they?
The hoodlums, the ruffians.

158
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,840
Go back to your kennel and tell
old man Haskel what you've heard.

159
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,960
What's going on? You've heard
of the Hatfield and McCoy feud?

160
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:05,160
This is between the McCorkles
and the Haskels. Who? Come on.

161
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,640
What are you doing?
Looking for a nice soft one.

162
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,720
Oh, quit kicking me!

163
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,640
Look out. Now, just a minute.
Just a minute. You might miss him.

164
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,920
Down.

165
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,080
You hoodlums! You'll pay for this!

166
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,920
Now.

167
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,280
Stand aside...

168
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,960
I hit the wrong man.
No, you hit the right man.

169
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,720
Run! No, wait. Come on.

170
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,960
They got me. It's blood!
I've been shot. I've been stabbed.

171
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,480
You're all right, CJ. I'm not
all right. Call an ambulance.

172
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,440
It isn't blood, CJ. It isn't blood?

173
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,040
What is it? Tomato juice.

174
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,040
All's clear. Come on in.

175
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,040
Boy, you sure do know
your back yards and fences.

176
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,840
I'd have been faster without you.
I didn't want you to carry my case.

177
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,360
Have a doughnut, hero.
It's the best I can offer.

178
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,880
Hero? Me? You certainly are.

179
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,560
They may put up a statue of you,
like the discus fellow.

180
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:25,320
It was an accident - hitting my...
that man. It was a stroke of genius.

181
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,360
Everybody hates Haskel. Why?

182
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,080
I could give you a reason for every
dollar he's got in the bank.

183
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,920
He's trying to drive us out because
he hates music. What a stinker.

184
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,400
The name of Haskel
is poison around here.

185
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,760
It is?

186
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,440
Well...

187
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,120
I guess I'd better be going.

188
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,640
What's your hurry?

189
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,480
I have to find a place to live.
I was going to live with a relative.

190
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,200
If you'd like a place
where there's never a dull moment...

191
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,240
What's going on? What do you want?

192
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,160
He needs a place to live. Are
you in a band or are you paying?

193
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,200
This is the fellow
that hit Haskel with a tomato.

194
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,040
Oh, glory be.

195
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,400
You darling!
Why didn't you tell me?

196
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,920
So, you're the fella.

197
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,960
Don't look any further. You're
living with us. Give me the bag.

198
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,960
That's nice, but... No buts. The
best room is none too good for you.

199
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:36,520
Whether you can pay for it or not.
Give me the bag. ..Willy!

200
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:41,000
We've been looking for you.
I've finished that arrangement.

201
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,840
Take this bag up to the big room.

202
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,160
Does anybody else carry anything?
Stop grumbling.

203
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,680
Let me see it, Horace.

204
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,720
These changes are swell.
Slide over, Frankie.

205
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,760
All right, boys, let's go.

206
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,880
# Say, when he starts to play

207
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,120
# The kids begin to trail him
And they all say

208
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,160
# Hooray for Pete the Piper

209
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,040
# And when he plays a song

210
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,920
# The kids never fail him
They sing a song

211
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,600
# Along with Pete the Piper

212
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,320
# People gather round
when they hear the sound

213
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,560
# The Campbells are coming,
Hooray, hooray

214
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,280
# When their lively feet
catch the piper's beat

215
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,320
# They start to sway

216
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,440
# And then it isn't long
Till all the folks are dancing

217
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,200
# Their hearts are gay
When he plays them a song

218
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,280
# When he's done all that
They pass the hat

219
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,280
# For fascinating Pete the Piper Man

220
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,400
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to butt in.

221
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,920
Get 'em, boys.

222
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,360
I didn't mean to bust things up.
Quiet, please.

223
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,760
Can you read music? Sure. Play it
like this. Me? Stand over there.

224
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,080
OK, Frankie, pick it up.

225
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,360
# People gather round
when they hear the sound

226
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,400
# The Campbells are coming

227
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,560
Hooray!

228
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,600
# It won't be long
Till all the folks are dancing

229
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,000
# Their hearts are gay
When he plays them a song

230
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,400
# When he's done all that
They pass the hat

231
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,120
# For fascinating Pete the Piper Man

232
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,240
# Fascinating Pete the Piper Man. #

233
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,680
Boys, look who's here. Grady.

234
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,720
Grady!

235
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,240
Oh, Molly!

236
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,400
Grady's been pounding the beat
out by the dumps.

237
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,920
A little argument
with old man Haskel.

238
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,960
You should have been here.
You'd have been even for life.

239
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,000
What happened? Oh, boy. Plenty.

240
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,520
< What they call poetic justice.

241
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,440
It must've been good.
It was perfect.

242
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,480
Well, come on. Come on. Out with it.

243
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,800
Old man Haskel came steaming over
here, and he got hit with a tomato.

244
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,840
< Right in the kisser.

245
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,720
It was a soft one, naturally.

246
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,240
The hit-and-run kind.

247
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,920
Nobody knows who did it, I hope.

248
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,760
Nobody but me. But I'm big-hearted.
Boys, meet the sharpshooter.

249
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:14,200
Molly McCorkle, will you never
learn to keep your big mouth shut?

250
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,240
What did I say? Too much.

251
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,760
Open up, boys. Open up.

252
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,280
Open up. Open up.

253
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,960
My boy, you should have a medal.
Instead, I have to give you this.

254
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,000
Thanks very much. What is it?

255
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,640
A warrant for assault and battery.
Old man Haskel swore it out.

256
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,160
Come on, son.

257
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,240
Wait. Wait a minute.

258
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,880
Wouldn't you like to give me
a good kick before you go?

259
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,720
It's OK. It's been fun here.
I enjoyed jumping over those fences.

260
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,960
If I get this thing straightened
out...I hope you let me come back.

261
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,440
And thanks for that doughnut.
It was... It was all right.

262
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,480
Er...well, come on, Grady.

263
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,000
Yeah, yeah.

264
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,280
Next case.

265
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,520
Hold everything.
We'll be right there.

266
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,120
Molly, where are you? Come on!

267
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,720
Order! Order in the court room!

268
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,640
Mrs McCorkle, sit down.

269
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,570
Listen, Mike.

270
00:22:26,571 --> 00:22:31,440
Don't get on your
high horse with me. Sit down!

271
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,880
Now, what's this case all about?

272
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,400
Young man, what's your name?

273
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,640
My name?
I'd prefer your real name.

274
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,720
Er...well, my name is...

275
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,320
James Hamilton...

276
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,120
James Hamilton. Put that down.

277
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,880
Where do you live, James Hamilton?
He lives with us.

278
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,520
419, 63rd Street.

279
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:08,200
Tell me, James, how did you get
enmeshed in the coils of the law?

280
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,720
I threw a tomato.

281
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,520
He's too modest, Mike.
Hit him with a bull's-eye

282
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,040
right in old man Haskel's face.
He did?

283
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,000
Where were we? I'd just thrown
the tomato, Your Honour.

284
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,040
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

285
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,720
Now tell me, Jimmy, my boy,

286
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,006
did you with premeditation

287
00:23:36,008 --> 00:23:39,880
and intent aim at Mr Haskel's face?
Well...

288
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,900
He refuses to answer on the grounds

289
00:23:42,901 --> 00:23:45,920
that he might incriminate himself.

290
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,960
You certainly know the law.

291
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,000
Having weighed the evidence,
the court rules

292
00:23:53,001 --> 00:23:55,480
that the case be postponed

293
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,840
and the defendant released on bail.

294
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,880
Provided anybody has any money.

295
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,360
Is 200 enough?

296
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,200
That was the exact sum
the court had in mind. Who has it?

297
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,720
I have it, Your Honour.
The clerk will accept it.

298
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,720
Next case. Thank you, Mike.
Stand aside, please. >

299
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,571
Move over Who are you pushing?

300
00:24:21,573 --> 00:24:25,280
Take it easy, will you?
Don't push me!

301
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:30,440
Here comes double pneumonia. Open
the windows. I smell stale tomatoes.

302
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,240
Very funny, Mrs McCorkle.
Very funny.

303
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,280
I wish it'd been you who threw that
tomato. I'd have put a rock in it.

304
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:44,320
You would, would you? Well...

305
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,360
Proceed with the case, judge.

306
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,920
I'm here.
Where's the man that assaulted me?

307
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:56,280
I'll conduct this case without any
advice from you. That's telling him.

308
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,000
< Move along.

309
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,520
In you go.

310
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,920
All right, take it away, Eddie.

311
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,240
I bring a charge against the hoodlum.

312
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:32,280
Before I give evidence, he's allowed
to walk out right under your nose.

313
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:37,600
First, he wasn't under my nose.
Second, he was released on bail.

314
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:43,440
Third, you're in contempt of court.
I sentence you to 25 days or 25.

315
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,680
That ain't enough, Mike.
Quiet.

316
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:51,520
This is an outrage, a travesty
of justice. 50 dollars or 50 days.

317
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,080
What? Make up your mind. It's worth
50 to tell you what I think.

318
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,000
Is it worth 100? All right.
But you wait until the next election.

319
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,960
You wait until... I'm waiting.

320
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:10,000
Until... Your Honour, it appears
that I haven't any money with me.

321
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,901
Take him away, bailiff.

322
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:16,040
You can't do this to me!
You can't do this to me!

323
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,720
# As he sang

324
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,520
# In the evening

325
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,520
# By the moonlight. #

< What about
Johnny Toots His Horn?

327
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,160
We don't want that.
We want something to pick us up.

328
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:56,200
Johnny Toots His Horn. What did
you say? Johnny Toots His Horn.

329
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,560
Do you know it? Yeah. Let's see.

330
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,520
# You gotta get up, you gotta get up,
You're in the army now

331
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,480
# Johnny blows the bugle
Knows the call from A to Z

332
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,095
# But he's always at his best

333

00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:21,640

# Before your eyes are open
You're dressing on the run

339
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,280
# Standing at attention with the
sergeant's hat and corporal's gun

340
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,000
# Oh, Johnny blows and blows
He toot-toots you into your clothes

341
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,600
# Then makes you rue the day
that you were born Day you were born

343

# You've gotta get up
When Johnny toots his horn

345
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,480
TAPPING

346
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,040
# La la-la la la

347
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,360
# He toots you out of slumber
He toots you out of bed

348
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,480
# He toots you into line, then he
goes somewhere and hangs his head

349
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,961
# But still he blows
and blows and blows,

350
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:35,960
blows and blows, blows and blows

351

# Blows and blows and blows,
yeah, yeah

352
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,160
# He wakes you with his crazy tune
Goes to bed and sleeps till noon

353

# You've gotta get up
When Johnny toots his horn

354
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,720
# He stands behind the barricade

355
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,840

# When Johnny toots his horn. #

360
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,840
Music? Even in jail I hear music.

361
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,360
You'll get used to it.

362
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,160
Let me down. Take your hands
off of me. Stop this nonsense.

363
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,720
You're nothing but hoodlums!

364
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,760
Jimmy, my boy. Uncle Charlie,
fancy meeting you here.

365
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,800
It's a miscarriage of justice.
They can't do this.

366
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,320
Why are you here?

367
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:58,360
Just another country boy who got
mixed up with evil companions.

368
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,618
What's wrong?
Too many prisoners.

369
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,840
Someone sneaked in. What?

370
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,000
Defrauding the taxpayers,
that's what it is.

371
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,560
Gangway. Line up there. Line up.

372
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,080
You, what's your name? Haskel.

373
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,120
OK. We've got a Haskel.
Stand over there.

374
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,160
What's your name? Haskel.
A wise guy, huh?

375
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,680
I suppose you're all Haskel.
Yeah.

376
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,720
What's your initial? James H.
I got no James H nothing.

377
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,240
So you're the stowaway.
You ought to be locked up.

378
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,760
James, my wallet is in my office.
Get it and pay my fine.

379
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,800
I'll be right back. So long, fellas.

380
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,840
So long, Jimmy.

381
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,440
Hey, can you sing?

382
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,960
No. I hate music. We've got to
do something about this, boys.

383
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,600
Say "Ah"!

384
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,480
Ahhhhhh!

385
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,760
Hey! Jimmy, where have you been?
Yeah, yeah.

386
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,280
Well... Me? I...

387
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,080
I'll have to... What's the matter?

388
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,040
We've been looking all over town
for you. What for? What for? Come on.

389
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,680
Hey, here's Jim.

390
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,720
Molly, Jimmy's here. What did I say?
I knew he'd come back.

391
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,760
Where have you been?
I got locked up by mistake.

392
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,280
You had the boys worried.
They thought you'd run out on them.

393
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,800
So what? They pawned
their instruments for your bail.

394
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,840
Molly's idea. Oh, well, thanks.

395
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,360
Nice to know
I'm worth 200 on the hoof.

396
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,880
First call for dinner!

397
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,800
You're back. You'll eat at the
first table. Look after him, Molly.

398
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,520
Don't touch a thing. Get up,
all of you. What's the matter, Ma?

399
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,560
We've got a new member to the clan.
You sit here.

400
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,600
Willy, get up. Stop your grumbling.

401

Tomatoes? Thank you.

Well, help yourself.

No tomatoes.

444

What's the matter? Nothing. Nothing.

445

Maybe you're right. The jail and
everything. I'll get some fresh air.

Willy, you'd better go with him.
Sure. You don't...

449
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,960
Maybe I'd be better off
if I went up to my room.

450
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,080
Willy, show him his room.
I do everything except eat.

451

If you want anything, just holler.

00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,040
# You gotta get up
Toot-tootly tootle...

456
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,045
No, no. It's outrageous.

457
00:37:16,046 --> 00:37:20,560
You're getting better.
I don't want to. I hate music!

458
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,080
You're so unreasonable.
All right. All right. All right.

459
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,920
Try it again. Put in some gesture.

460
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,535
# When Johnny toots his horn

461
00:37:29,536 --> 00:37:31,960
Disturbing the peace
at break of the dawn

462
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,295
# You gotta get up
Toot, tooty toot-toot

463
00:37:34,296 --> 00:37:35,640
You're in the army now

464
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,240
# Before your eyes are open
You're dressing on the run

465
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,840
# The corporal's got the sergeant
at attention with his gun

466
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,560
# When Johnny blows and blows, he
toot-toots you into your clothes. #

467
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,160
Jimmy!

468
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,720
Where have you been?

469
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,600
You'll be sorry for this.

470
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,440
Look what they've done to my voice.

471
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,480
How am I going to broadcast
the Happiness Hour?

472
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,520
Couldn't you call it off? What?!

473
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:13,960
Say you lost your voice singing
in a jail. Don't be ridiculous!

474
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,880
Ladies and gentlemen, due to
circumstances beyond our control...

475
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,875
We bring you the Haskel Happiness
Hour.

476
00:38:22,876 --> 00:38:26,920
Makers of Haskel Pattycakes
the health food supreme.

477
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,480
HE CROAKS: Ladies and gentlemen...

478
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,360
I can't do it. I'm croaking.

479
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,240
Jimmy, you do it. Oh, no. Oh, no.

480
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,760
Mr Haskel will be with you soon.

481
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,320
Ladies and gentlemen! Ssh! Ssh!

482
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,800
Tonight, I want
to share a little poem with you.

483
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,440
We...all should be grateful
and happy as kings,

484
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,000
The world is so full
of such wonderful things,

485
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,040
The rain and the sun
help the earth to grow wheat...

486
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,880
Hey, Willy. What do you want?
Listen to this.

487
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,920
The sun on the oceans...
Forget about him...

488
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,560
Just listen for a moment.

489
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,680
The pansies... The pansies
and lilies, the primrose so fickle,

490
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,720
They're ours to enjoy
without spending a nickel.

491
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:44,800
Good evening, sir.
Evening, Parks.

492
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,680
Parks...is the guest room in order?

493
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,200
Certainly, sir.

494
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,120
This is my nephew, Mr James Haskel.

495
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:59,160
How do you do, sir?
Same to you.

496
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:04,200
Is your luggage in the car, sir?
I just had one suitcase...

497
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,240
Why are you whispering?
You started it, sir.

498
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,280
I lost my voice, singing. You?

499
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,120
I'll get my suitcase.
We have everything here.

500
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,600
Come on.

501
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,840
HE RASPS: Here you are, my boy.
This is all yours from now on.

502
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,880
I'm so happy to have you
with me at last. Thanks.

503
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,560
In case you need anything.
That's fine.

504
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:37,200
We'll have breakfast at 7.30. Then
I'll take you over to the factory.

505
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:43,200
I'll put you on the payroll. I don't
imagine you've got much money.

506
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,680
Your cashier cashed a cheque for me.
Your personal cheque?

507
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,560
For how much? It was certified.

508
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,600
214. That's what was left
when I closed up shop.

509
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,840
That dismal episode
is behind you for ever, my boy.

510
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:03,880
Tomorrow is another day. With more
music by the McCorkles, probably.

511
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:09,640
Jimmy, that old lady is deliberately
trying to wreck my health.

512
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,680
Why? Because I want her property.

513
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:17,560
That's unreasonable. It's getting
on my nerves. I can't stand it.

514
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,080
Why don't you go on a vacation?

515
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:24,600
The McCorkles will think
they chased me out of town.

516
00:41:24,601 --> 00:41:26,600
That's what they want.

517
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,781
Nothing will stand in the way
of my getting the man

518
00:41:30,783 --> 00:41:33,160
who hit me with that tomato!

519
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,440
This is my room if you want me.

520
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,520
I'm going to take a hot bath
and go to bed. Good night, Jimmy.

521
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,040
Goodbye, Uncle Charlie.

522
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:20,320
# Do you believe in fairy tales?

523
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:25,160
# I do-o-o-o

524
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:30,600

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,400
# Just close your drowsy eyes
my dear

527
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,920
# And a genie will appear

528
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,480
# He'll take you by the hand

529
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,320
# And through a star-embroidered sky

530
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:53,520
# On a carpet you will fly

531
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,560
# And you'll awake in fairyland

532
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:01,560
# Ooh-ooh-ooh

533
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:06,000
# A prince will ride upon the scene

534
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,040
# La-la-la-la-la-ah

535
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,240
# Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

536
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:16,080
# He'll say, "Fair lady, be my queen"

537
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,120
# La-la-la-la-la-ah

538
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,320
# Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

539
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,400
# In this beautiful land of laughter

540
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:31,240
# You'll live happily ever after

541
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:36,480
# If you believe that fairy tales

542
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,520
# Come true. #

543
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:37,400
# Do you believe in fairy tales?

544
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,520
# I do

545
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,760
# La-da-da-da-da-da

546
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,400
# I know a place where fairy tales

547
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,680
# Come true

548
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,760
# La-da-da-da-da-da

549
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,400
# Just close your drowsy eyes
my dear

550
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,680
# And a genie will appear

551
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,120
# He'll take you by the hand

552
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:05,440
# And through a star-embroidered sky

553
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,680
# On a carpet you will fly

554
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,000
# And you'll awake in fairyland

555
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,880
# Do you believe in fairy tales?... #

556
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:26,920
Stop that infernal music!
You white-headed old baboon...

557
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,560
Quiet, wench! Jasper, where are you?
Yes, CJ?

558
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,800
Go and get the jester. OK, CJ.

559
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,040
Run, Jimmy, run for your life!

560
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,000
# Our prince will ride
upon the scene... #

561
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,040
Run, Jimmy, run for your life!

562
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,280
Look out, he's got an axe!

563
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,800
Don't touch me! What's the matter?

564
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,320
Look out! Wait, what's the matter?

565
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,160
# He'll say,
"Won't you be my queen?"... #

566
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,920
Oh! What a dream I was having!

567
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,680
Well,
you just keep right on dreaming.

568
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,720
OK with me!

569
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,080
Oh!

570
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,400
Good night.

571
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,400
Good night(!)

572
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:47,120
Hello. Hello. Is anything wrong?

573
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,160
We heard you on the radio. You did?

574
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,200
Wasn't I terrible?

575
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,320
Did Molly hear it? No. That's good.

576
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:00,360
What goes on
between you and CJ Haskel?

577
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,040
I'll tell you, he's my uncle.

578
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,560
Oh, yeah? Here. I'll prove it to you.

579
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:11,600
Here's a letter to James Hamilton
Haskel. Want to read it? No.

580
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,120
What is this? Why are you here?

581
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:18,960
I almost forgot what I came for.
There's 200 for your instruments.

582
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,000
Did you get that from your uncle?
You don't know my uncle.

583
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,480
Thank you, Jim.
That's OK. I like the people here.

584
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,720
Especially... I like everybody.
I'd like to live here.

585
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:36,800
But as soon as Molly finds out...
Suppose she doesn't find out.

586
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,600
That would be nice, but...
You didn't have to get that dough.

587
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:45,120
I'm for you, Jimmy. Horace?
Sure thing.

588
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,960
Well, thanks very much.

589
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:53,000
I've still got troubles. Sooner or
later, Molly will find out who I am.

590
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,840
Just like old man Haskel
will find out who threw that tomato.

591
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:01,880
It just won't work.
Either way, I'm a dead duck.

592
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,010
How's your uncle going to find out?

593
00:48:05,011 --> 00:48:09,840
He'll see me at the trial.
What if he didn't show up?

594
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:14,360
They'll throw the case out. We'll
get rid of Uncle Charlie. How?

595
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:19,400
Red can run over him with the wagon.
Do you think he would? You couldn't!

596
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,040
Red'd love it. I'll get him.

597
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:26,560
Wait. Couldn't you do something
not quite so drastic?

598
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:31,320
Any ideas? Yeah, I think
I'd better go back to Point Jurvis.

599
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:36,880
Uncle Charlie's tough. You'd better
find someplace else to rehearse.

600
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,280
So long, Horace.
Willy, thanks for everything.

601
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,320
Jim, wait. That's it. The band.

602
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:48,360
He doesn't like it.
No, he certainly does not.

603
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,800
Come on.

604
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,520
Tooty toot-toot.

605
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,680
Jimmy?

606
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,960
Do you think it will work, Horace?
If this doesn't fall off.

607
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,480
Yes, Uncle Charlie?

608
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,520
What are you doing? Who is this man?

609
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:37,440
I was worried about you. This is
Professor Heidt, Uncle Charlie.

610
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,960
I don't need a doctor.
I eat my own health foods.

611
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,680
It's my nerves that are cracking.

612
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,400
I'm here to work on your nerves.

613
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,840
Relax, please.

614
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,960
How can anybody relax
with that music going on?

615
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,640
Music?

616
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,440
Music?

617
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,480
What music?

618
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,520
That creepy music.
Don't you hear it?

619
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,560
You see what I mean, Professor?

620
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,520
I tell you, I hear music!

621
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,280
Maybe it's the radio in the library.

622
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,000
It's not the radio. You still
hear it? Yes, it's still playing.

623
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,040
Where does this music
seem to be coming from?

624
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:33,080
I don't know.
Just a moment, I'll tell you.

625
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,280
It's here. It's plainer down here.

626
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,400
Don't you think you'd better
go back to bed? I hear it.

627
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,000
Here.

628
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:53,080
Here it is.
It's coming from the furnace.

629
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:57,120
Music in furnace.
Well, listen yourself.

630
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,160
Jimmy, please tell him you hear it.

631
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,960
I'll get Parks.
He'll get me out of this.

632
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,720
Parks will back me up.

633
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,528
Don't tell me you don't hear
anything.

634
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:17,000
Yes. I was getting nervous.

635
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,040
A beautiful string quartet.
String quartet. It's bugles!

636
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,560
Hears bugles on phone.

637
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:28,400
I hear bugles. It's bugles.
Don't try to humour me.

638
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,400
At least you're not seeing things.
There's nothing wrong with me.

639
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,480
Jimmy, look! What do you see?

640
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,640
What do you want us to see?
Girls dancing. Where?

641
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,880
There!

642
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,880
Sees paper dolls dancing on lawn.

643
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,920
Paper dolls. You're right.
I'm in a terrible shape.

644
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,440
My nerves are all gone.

645
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:08,440
What do you think I should do?
Give your nerves a long rest.

646
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:13,600
Get out of town. I'll do it.
I'll go up in the woods.

647
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:18,640
We'll help you pack. Not until I
find the man who threw that tomato.

648
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,680
Your health is more important
than a silly tomato.

649
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,200
That's right. Let me handle this.

650
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,240
I'll find him.
He's as good as in jail. Almost.

651
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:33,800
While you're resting,
he'll be taken care of. I'll do it.

652
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:38,280
Good. I'll take the first train
out in the morning.

653
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,120
What's the matter now?

654
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,640
The music's stopped.

655
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,680
All but the bull fiddle.
You're improving already.

656
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,200
Yes.

657
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:01,160
Hi. What can I do for you?
Hello, Mr Louderman.

658
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:06,200
Could we make the Haskel Happiness
Hour happier? Welcome, stranger.

659
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,240
Sit down. What'll you have? Well...
Hello, Mr Baccus.

660
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:14,280
What's this meeting about?
To discuss the programme.

661
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:19,320
I'm in charge during Mr Haskel's
absence. He trusts me. Not 100%.

662
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:24,360
I beg your pardon? My uncle has
given me charge of the programme.

663
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:29,800
It didn't take long to undermine me.
You could have written it.

664
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:34,160
There'll be no changes...
I'd like to talk to you.

665
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,200
Yes, we should talk this over.

666
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,720
I'll be right back.

667
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,800
I'd like to make other improvements.
Go right ahead.

668
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,840
I'd like to use a band.
No. We have loads of bands.

669
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:57,040
My uncle hates this one.
It drove him up to Canada.

670
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:02,520
Why do you want them on his
programme? It'll give them a break.

671
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:07,520
Then they'll have to thank my uncle.
He'll feel good. Up in Canada?

672
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:12,200
There's a feud going on. A feud?
Then there's a girl.

673
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,920
Oh, a girl. Yeah.

674
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:18,160
Sounds pretty confusing,
doesn't it?

675
00:55:18,161 --> 00:55:21,400
No. It sounds pretty good. It does?

676
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:26,440
You play Thursday night
at the Eastchester Country Club.

677
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:31,960
How did you do it? I talked, he
listened. I'm as surprised as you.

678
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:36,800
How much do we get for it?
Nothing. You don't get anything.

679
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:41,640
What of it? We don't get money
for playing to the neighbours.

680
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,200
At least this way there's a chance.

681
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,720
I'm sold. What can we lose?
It's OK with me.

682
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,680
Give me a push.

683
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,200
Bon soir, monsieur.

684
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,240
What did he say? Bonsoir, monsieur.

685
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,880
You made me walk for hours
to get to a place

686
00:56:09,881 --> 00:56:12,280
where no-one speaks English!

687
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,320
What kind of a guide are you?

688
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:18,400
Avez vous a machine, talkie-talkie?

689
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,600
I don't think so.
I've got a good one right there.

690
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,320
I'm not a peddler. This one's busted.

691
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:30,360
I want to hear an American programme
at eight o'clock. Help yourself.

692
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,400
Here. Get this avalanche off my back.

693
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,840
Oui, monsieur.

694
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,480
"Oui, monsieur."

695
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:06,240
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
We're about to start our broadcast.

696
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,280
Well, boys, here we go.

697
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,800
Good luck.

698
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:15,680
Are you scared?
Just take a deep breath.

699
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:25,440
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
The Haskel Happiness Hour

700
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,120
'from Eastchester Country Club.'
Country club?

701
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,200
The first appearance
of a new band...

702
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,000
Music? On my programme?

703
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,520
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Horace Heidt.

704
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:43,440
The first number is Broadway
Caballero, featuring Molly McCorkle.

705
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,880
McCorkle?

706
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,160
And here she is, the charming Molly.

707
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:58,560
# He's disarming, alarming
Charming and gay

708
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:03,440
# First, he steals your heart
Then he throws it away

709
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,040
# He will tell you
of tropical nights

710
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,480
# Make you dream
of a thousand delights

711
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,160
# First, he'll hold your hand
Say you're simply grand

712
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,840
# Soon you're thinking his way

713
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,840
# Caballero
He's never been south of the border

714
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:43,480
# He's never been Argentine way

715
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:46,385
# When he starts to pet
The chances are you'll forget

716
00:58:46,386 --> 00:58:48,360
That he's a Caballero from Broadway

717
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:51,080
# South on Broadway

718
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:55,840
# He'll hold you and say "Senorita,
right here in my arms you must stay"

719
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,411
# And from his dialect

720
00:58:57,413 --> 00:59:01,200
You'd never suspect
He's the Caballero from Broadway

721
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,480
# South on Broadway

722
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:08,560
# His daytime,
he spends parading on the Avenue

723
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:13,440
# Then, later, you'll find me with
a girl or two and a third in view

724
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,520
# He'll take you
to all the gay places

725
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,720
# He'll make every Latin cafe

726
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,480
# He'll give you such a thrill
Then he'll hand you the bill

727
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:24,200
# This charming
Caballero from Broadway

728
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,720
# South on Broadway

729
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,160
# When Madame Lazanga
learned the conga, I swear

730
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,720
# I gave her the lessons,
then I gave her the air

731
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,556
# It seemed to be love in bloom
And then suddenly, boom!

732
00:59:39,558 --> 00:59:41,280
Another girl took over from there

733
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,440
# I know if you meet him
you are likely to fall

734
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,600
# His methods are sense
because he catches them all

735
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:51,680
# He'll sing you a serenade tenderly
played on an old mail-order guitar

736
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,040
# He'll bring up
the subject of dancing

737
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,400
# And all of his pupils will say

738
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,900
# He's such an awful crumb
but no-one dances the rumba

739
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:07,040
like the Caballero from Broadway

740
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,480
# South on Broadway

741
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:26,680
# He'll tell you he lives in
Argentina's biggest house

742
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:32,200
# But we know his hacienda is
a boarding house run by Senor Klaus

743
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:37,000
# He's such an impetuous fellow
He's like a dog having his day

744
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,680
# This phoney Don Amigo
Really comes from Oswego

745
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:45,320
# For a Caballero from Broadway
He does OK!

746
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,255
# You'd better lock your heart or
he will tear it apart

747
01:02:14,256 --> 01:02:16,520
and then it's
just the start and you're in trouble

748
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,950
# You think you're up on top
but you are due

749
01:02:18,951 --> 01:02:21,880
for a drop because
your dream will pop like a bubble

750
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:24,690
# He's the kind of man
that you'll never forget,

751
01:02:24,691 --> 01:02:26,800
the diamond Caballero from Broadway

752
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:31,640
# Way down south on Broadway. #

753
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:45,560
Molly, you were wonderful.
Put this on before you catch cold.

754
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:50,080
Louderman said the band are worth
1,500 a week. 1,500 a week?

755
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,600
That means we're a success!

756
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:56,200
I've been double-crossed.
Get me a drink.

757
01:02:56,200 --> 01:03:00,960
Bands. Country clubs. The McCorkles.
Get me a drink, do you hear?

758
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:05,000
I want to tell you something.
It took you long enough.

759
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,040
This is something
that's been worrying me.

760
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:13,600
You don't know anything about me.
So what? You're you and I'm me.

761
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:17,680
Well... There you are. You thought
you'd made an impression.

762
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:22,600
I'll tell your uncle about it.
CJ won't pay for your philandering.

763
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,320
Is Haskel your uncle?

764
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:31,360
Yes. If you just let me explain.
It's all perfectly obvious.

765
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:36,400
Sneaking into our home, pretending
to help us. Please let me explain.

766
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,920
What a cheap trick. You are
a Haskel. Molly, they can hear you.

767
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,480
That's fine!

768
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,480
Hello, everybody.

769
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,990
I have good news.

770
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:52,520
Every week, Mr Haskel,
who sponsors the programme,

771
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:56,160
is going to give away 1,000
in cash.

772
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:59,320
1,000 a week?! That's a lie!

773
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,760
Isn't that generous, folks?

774
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:08,320
Now, Mr Haskel,
trick your way out of that.

775
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:16,280
I've got to get home. How long
will it take? It'll take two days...

776
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:21,320
How long did it take to get here? A
week. You'll make it back in a week.

777
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,800
Let's get started.

778
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:29,240
Jimmy! Jimmy! Congratulations.
That was a marvellous idea.

779
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:33,760
How did you think of it?
It came out of a clear sky.

780
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:40,546
"The Haskel Happiness Hour
announced

781
01:04:40,548 --> 01:04:44,160
that 1,000 a week
would be given away."

782
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:48,040
I read all the papers.
Here's Mr Haskel.

783
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:53,600
Your uncle's attorney - Mr Chalmers.
How do you do? Sign this paper.

784
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:58,640
What is it? A statement that you
did not authorise that announcement.

785
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:02,636
She did it to damage your uncle.
Sign here.

786
01:05:02,638 --> 01:05:05,240
Wait a minute.
Don't worry.

787
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:08,095
We can get judgment
against the McCorkles.

788
01:05:08,096 --> 01:05:10,000
We can take their property.

789
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,520
Your uncle's been trying to do that
for years. Sign here, please.

790
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:19,783
I don't like to be pushed around
or sign anything I haven't read.

791
01:05:19,785 --> 01:05:21,160
Get out of here!

792
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:23,720
Don't hit me again. I have glasses!

793
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:27,520
Mr Haskel...
Good day, sir. Good day.

794
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,800
Beautiful, Parks.
Thank you, sir.

795
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,120
Why don't you answer the phone?

796
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:47,240
Hello? Oh, Jimmy, my boy,
how are you?

797
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:50,080
You want to talk to Molly.

798
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:54,800
Well, I don't think
it's a very good time to...

799
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,480
Just a moment.

800
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,743
Fight your own battles.

801
01:05:59,745 --> 01:06:03,880
I'm not doing it for you.
I don't want...

802
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,680
Well?

803
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:10,720
I hate to annoy you
but this is important.

804
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,400
That 1,000 offer was my idea.

805
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:18,600
Just don't argue. If anybody asks
about it, follow Grady's advice.

806
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:22,400
Don't tell me to keep my mouth shut.
Why should I?

807
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,551
If you don't,
they'll take your home.

808
01:06:25,553 --> 01:06:28,280
I don't need your help. ..What?

809
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:32,320
Don't be stupid.
I'm doing it for Mom and the boys.

810
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:34,960
Oh!

811
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:40,000
Excuse me, sir. Mr Louderman
and Mr Samson. Have them come in.

812
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,520
Hello.
Hello, Jimmy. Congratulations.

813
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:48,040
Your programme was a knockout.
Calls from all over the country.

814
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:51,080
This is Mr Samson.
How do you do?

815
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:55,600
Mr Samson is an investigator
for the federal government.

816
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:59,120
What's the government
got to do with it?

817
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:03,116
We want to know how you'll give away
the money.

818
01:07:03,118 --> 01:07:05,160
That shouldn't be hard.

819
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:08,921
Nobody has trouble giving away
1,000.

820
01:07:08,923 --> 01:07:11,200
It cannot be a lottery.

821
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,200
No raffles or drawings.

822
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:18,280
Oh, yes, I understand that.
That would be...

823
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:21,880
Well, how about a quiz contest?

824
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:26,221
It said the money would be
given way over the air,

825
01:07:26,223 --> 01:07:27,960
not to an audience.

826
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:33,520
That sort of complicates things,
doesn't it? Let's see...

827
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:38,600
Stick a pin the city directory
and give that person the 1,000?

828
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:42,760
No. That would be local.
This has become national.

829
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:46,560
Let's call it off
and not give away the money.

830
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,120
No, no. The money was promised.

831
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:54,040
I would lose my franchise. Your
uncle's business would be ruined.

832
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,800
You could be fined and imprisoned.

833
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,680
Well, that's great.

834
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:02,720
I have quite a choice, don't I?

835
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:07,760
I give the money away and go to
jail, or I don't and go to jail.

836
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,800
Hand me the salt.

837
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:18,040
Still mooning about Jimmy, huh?
You've seen the last of him.

838
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:23,360
He's probably glad he's found out
what you're like. All right, Mom.

839
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:28,400
It's not all right. Jimmy deserves
a girl who really loves him.

840
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,640
Whether his name be Haskel
or Hassenpfeffer.

841
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:36,680
Well, I hope you're satisfied.
What's the matter now?

842
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:40,720
Nobody can figure out
how to give away that 1,000.

843
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,698
Jimmy's going to jail because of it.

844
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:46,760
This is awful.
But I made the offer.

845
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:52,360
He says he'll take the rap. Are
you going to let him go to jail?

846
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:57,400
Jimmy said... I know why he said
it. To keep a roof over our heads.

847
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:02,160
I'd rather lose our house
than lose our pride.

848
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:06,960
Oh, Mom. I've been feeling
the same way all week.

849
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:14,840
Yes. ..No.
..Not yet.

850
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:19,360
Gentlemen, someone's got to
think of something and soon.

851
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:23,400
The programme goes on air tonight,
not next month.

852
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:27,960
We're no closer to the answer
than we were a week ago.

853
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,440
Yes... I've got it!

854
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:33,080
It came to me just like that.

855
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:38,560
We'll get that glass bowl they use
for the draft numbers. That's it.

856
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:43,920
I'm proud of you. That'll do it.
The government forbids lotteries.

857
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:48,960
No. Not yet. I'll see if I can
dream up something else.

858
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:54,000
You're not sleeping. No. I'm eating
aspirin tablets like peanuts.

859
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,160
I've got it. What?
The first time I've beat this game.

860
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:02,471
Why don't you all
go to the broadcasting station?

861
01:10:02,473 --> 01:10:05,200
Maybe I'll think of something.

862
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,880
We'll get out. Samson, come on.

863
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:12,680
No. ..Not yet. Put that thing
off the hook and leave it off.

864
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:15,480
Thank you, sir. Yeah.

865
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:18,000
Are you all right, Jimmy?

866
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,520
I'm just getting my second wind.

867
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:23,040
You'd better think of something.

868
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:36,676
7.30. Heard from Jimmy?
No. Nobody answers.

869
01:10:36,678 --> 01:10:38,200
How are we to go on?

870
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:41,240
When it's 8 o'clock, you're on.

871
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:44,040
From coast to coast.

872
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,280
Coming, Mr Haskel. Coming.

873
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:06,880
About time. Why didn't you
answer the telephone? You see...

874
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,920
How do you like that? Ow!

875
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:15,600
Come on! Wake up! Get up. I can't
do it. It's against the law.

876
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,120
It's Molly. Get up!

877
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:22,160
Oh, it's you.
Yes, it's me. Now, come on.

878
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:27,200
I suppose you want to know how
I'm going to give away the 1,000.

879
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,040
I don't know. Go home. Go home?

880
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:34,880
You come down here as fast
as you can. On your feet, big boy!

881
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:39,920
If you think we'll let a Haskel
fight our battles, you're cuckoo.

882
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:44,280
We won't let McCorkles kick
us around. Go on. Go away.

883
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:47,320
Still going to sleep, huh?

884
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:50,360
Just a second. Don't you dare.

885
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:53,800
You can't do that.
Where's the telephone?

886
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:02,440
What are you doing? I'm going to
tell them what happened.

887
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:05,240
Give me that. I've made up my mind.

888
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:09,280
Let go of that phone.
No, I won't. All right.

889
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,320
That's it!

890
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:19,360
Hands spinning around. Millions
of telephones and telephone books.

891
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:23,400
Parks! And it's not a lottery.
Get my coat. Goodbye.

892
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,560
Ow! Oooh!

893
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,736
The Haskel Happiness Hour

894
01:12:35,738 --> 01:12:39,680
presents Horace Heidt
and his Musical Knights.

895
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:48,280
Before this programme is over,
we will give away 1,000 in cash.

896
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:52,320
The method of giving it
will be announced later.

897
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:57,400
# Here we come, all bright and gay

898
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:02,000
# It's the charge
of the Heidt Brigade. #

899
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:09,880
Here I am, CJ.
Did you stop the programme?

900
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:13,800
It's on the air now.
I'll tear down the studio.

901
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,320
Why am I in the radio business?

902
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:20,360
Jimmy, have you got an idea?
This is it. Take 'em.

903
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:24,400
They're telephone books
from all over the country.

904
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,920
Go and get the rest of them.

905
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,480
Gangway.

906
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:40,120
We're going to give
the money away by telephone.

907
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:45,200
Cut the books into sections of 500
pages. Put numbers on each one.

908
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:48,240
Get a table.

909
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,880
After you. Thank you.

910
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:59,280
Nice going. Come on, Parks.
We have to go.

911
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,680
Same to you. Fine work.

912
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:10,600
Ladies and gentlemen, here's
the news you've been waiting for.

913
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:16,280
'The 1,000 will be given away
by telephone.' That's my money!

914
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:20,320
I won't stand for it.
I'll cancel my contract.

915
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,840
Get me to a telephone!

916
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:26,240
How are we going to
borrow the wheel?

917
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:30,080
Come on, boys! Take home the bacon!

918
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:35,320
When I yell "Snooky", you borrow it.
What's Snooky? Get going.

919
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:44,680
Snooky! Where have you been?

920
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:48,880
Madam. Why did you leave me
the way you did?

921
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,920
Madam, I...
Why, you're not my Snooky at all.

922
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,880
A character. How do you like that?

923
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:58,640
Where... I've been robbed!

924
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:02,680
Police! Get a policeman.
Police! I've been robbed!

925
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:05,200
Gangway!

926
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:19,040
Hello. May I use your telephone?

927
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:23,080
Ma, Daniel Boone
wants to use our telephone!

928
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:28,720
Go away, tramp. No-one uses the
phone 'til they give away the money.

929
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:31,760
Tramp? Daniel Boone?

930
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,880
Look out! Look out!

931
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,800
Fellas, help out here.

932
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:52,160
Quiet. We're on the air. I know.

933
01:15:55,560 --> 01:16:00,600
You can't go in there! This ain't
a hillbilly programme. Let go!

934
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,098
I'm no hillbilly!

935
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:07,480
CJ, when did you get here?
Louderman! I want to talk to you!

936
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,120
All right, Horace. Go on.

937
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:16,080
The wheel is ready to spin for the
first volume number. Take it away!

938
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:19,960
There she goes,
ladies and gentlemen.

939
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:23,840
We want that volume
to have your name in it.

940
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,600
I'm not going to give away one penny.

941
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:32,000
OK, but I've got three sponsors
begging to buy this programme.

942
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,920
They must be crazy. Is that so?

943
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:39,520
They're from the biggest
advertising agencies in America.

944
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,960
What?! Wait a minute!

945
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:46,480
We want you to be the one
that Horace calls later.

946
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:52,080
It's going on and on and on.
And it's 124! 124!

947
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,120
124!

948
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:57,280
I've got it!

949
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:03,720
We're ready for the spin
to determine the page number.

950
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:09,120
The second spin to find the page in
that volume we chose a moment ago.

951
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:13,160
It will have the 1,000
winner's name on it!

952
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:17,680
This is Mr Haskel. The best
advertising stunt I've ever seen.

953
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:20,520
Is it good? I'll give you 20,000.

954
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:25,040
Is it that good? I'll make it 30.
Trying to steal it, huh?

955
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:30,400
She's going down to find the right
page. She's stopping. Page 66.

956
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,560
Page 66.

957
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:35,080
66!

958
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,600
I got it!

959
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:43,040
Now the final spin to determine the
person who will receive the call.

960
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,040
Larry, take it away.

961
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:50,280
This time, all the names
on the page of our chosen volume

962
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:54,320
to find the name that
we can send our pot of gold.

963
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:57,360
It's slowing down more and more.

964
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,360
There it is. Our listing is 38!

965
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:02,920
Listing number 38.

966
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,440
Ten. Fifteen. Twenty.

967
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:12,880
Thirty. One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

968
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:17,600
It says...
The name is Mr Olaf Swenson.

969
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,080
3RJ, ring seven. Ring seven?

970
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:24,520
Plunkett. Plunkett, Minnesota.

971
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:27,080
Plunkett, Minnesota.

972
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:32,360
Kindly give me Mr Olaf Swenson, 3RJ,
ring seven, Plunkett, Minnesota.

973
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:48,760
Ja, I'm coming. Keep your jacket on.

974
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:51,200
Ja. Hello?

975
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:56,080
Stop the clock, boys.
Is this Mr Olaf Swenson speaking?

976
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,680
Ja. That's me.

977
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:01,200
A pot of what?

978
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:04,200
A thou... You give me...

979
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:08,240
I ain't got no time
for monkey business.

980
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:09,680
What?

981
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:13,440
You give me 1,000?

982
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:16,960
Helga!

983
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:23,280
Why you make my Olaf faint?

984
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,720
What?

985
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,320
A thou...

986
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,760
Oh!

987
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:33,800
Hello? Hello? Hello?

988
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,680
Folks, they're speechless.

989
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,003
It's my million-dollar idea.

990
01:19:40,005 --> 01:19:44,640
They brought you back alive.
What are you doing here?

991
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,513
Enjoying our programme.

992
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:51,160
What are you trying to put over
on me? It belongs to me!

993
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:55,730
It does, does it?
The whole thing was Molly's idea.

994
01:19:55,731 --> 01:19:58,240
Molly's idea? Who is Molly?

995
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:02,720
We've got you out of the mess.
You're not liable.

996
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:07,040
Miss McCorkle is responsible
for the whole thing.

997
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:10,040
You nitwits! You numbskulls!

998
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:13,080
Get out of here! Get out of here!

999
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:16,560
That's swinging them, Charlie!

1000
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,000
Charlie?

1001
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:25,160
And Molly is responsible
for the whole thing.

1002
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:28,200
Where are you going? Out.

1003
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:33,400
Horace got the call through on
the telephone. Everything's fine.

1004
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,960
Yes. Everything's fine.

1005
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:40,000
Yeah... I guess it's just
one of those things.

1006
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,040
The McCorkles are allergic
to the Haskels.

1007
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,560
I expect so. Yeah, I expect so.

1008
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:49,080
Goodbye, Molly.

1009
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:51,600
Bye.

1010
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:57,480
Well, Jimmy? Uncle Charlie. You come
with me. You're in on this, too.

1011
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,240
Ladies and gentlemen,

1012
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:05,565
let me introduce
the people who originated

1013
01:21:05,566 --> 01:21:10,360
what will be a permanent
feature of the Haskel Happiness Hour.

1014
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:14,400
Miss Molly McCorkle
and my nephew, Mr James Haskel.

1015
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:19,920
Tell them how happy you are.

1016
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:25,680
I'd just like to tell you how happy
I am everything turned out well...

1017
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:30,760
Ladies and gentlemen, she's happy
because we're going to be married.

1018
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:35,600
All right, Miss McCorkle,
trick your way out of that one.

1019
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:41,360
Toot tootly-toot! Tootly-toot!

1020
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:49,760
# When Johnny toots his horn

1021
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:52,480
# The band will play

1022
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,960
# Your blues away

1023
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:01,040
# When Johnny toots his horn! #
