1
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:51,651
Another day to live through,
better get started.

2
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,396
December, 1965.

3
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:26,066
Is that all it has been since
I inherited the world?

4
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,308
Only three years.

5
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,728
It seems like a hundred million.

6
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:39,652
Yeah, I own the world.
An empty, dead, silent world.

7
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:53,588
More of them for the pit.
Every day there are more of them.

8
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:57,787
They live off the weak ones
and leave them for the pit.

9
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,294
K-O-K-W calling. Come in.

10
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,057
K-O-K-W calling.

11
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:03,903
I'm on international frequency. Come in.

12
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,432
They can't bear to see their image.

13
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,601
It repels them.

14
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,075
I need more mirrors.

15
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:48,114
And this garlic's lost its pungency.

16
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,135
There was a time when eating was pleasurable.

17
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:08,473
Now it bores me. Just fuel for survival.

18
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:12,342
I'll settle for coffee
and orange juice this morning.

19
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:17,886
But first there is my life to consider.
I'd better replace that garlic.

20
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:35,157
I need more, lots more.
Better stop off and get them.

21
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:02,027
I can't afford the luxury of anger.
Anger can make me vulnerable.

22
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:07,148
It can destroy my reason, and reason
is the only advantage I have over them.

23
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,785
I've got to find where
they hide during the day.

24
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,278
Uncover every one of them.

25
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,708
Now, where did I finish off yesterday?

26
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:20,122
Madison Street to 31st Avenue.

27
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:24,915
Eleven kills over three years.

28
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,749
And there's more than half
the city I haven't searched.

29
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,369
They're perfect.

30
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:57,290
Just wide enough to keep the flesh
apart so their body seal can't function.

31
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,918
How many more of these will I have to make...

32
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,045
before they're all destroyed?

33
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:06,085
They want my blood, it's their lives or mine.

34
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,629
But, I still get squeamish.

35
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,682
Wait... that garlic.

36
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,649
I'd better put it back where it belongs.

37
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:27,099
I can't live a heartbeat away
from hell and forget it.

38
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:16,530
I'm out of gas. That means
one more stop I'll have to make.

39
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,852
I can get rid of them later.

40
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,515
Right now, I'm out of gas.

41
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,599
They're still fresh.

42
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,389
But I'll take only what I need.
They've got to last.

43
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,764
They can wait too.
I've got my life to worry about.

44
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:50,212
Those mirrors have to be
replaced before dark.

45
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:25,386
Square blocks to search.
How many of them still exist?

46
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,709
How long will I have to keep up this search?

47
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,870
I haven't much time left.
It'll be dark in an hour.

48
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:32,555
And now 12 long hours
before the sun will rise...

49
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:36,094
and drive them back to darkness.

50
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,506
Morgan, come out.

51
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,883
Come out.

52
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:41,573
Morgan, come out. Come out.

53
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:26,538
Robert, help me!

54
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,219
Another day.

55
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:44,886
Another day to start all over again.

56
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,880
Virge.

57
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,967
Virge.

58
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:30,255
God, how I miss you.

59
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,461
The sun's already set. They'll be everywhere!

60
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,990
It's Morgan. Get him!

61
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,975
Do you hear?

62
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,494
Morgan.

63
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,536
Do you hear, Morgan?

64
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,546
Morgan.

65
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,834
Do you hear, Morgan?

66
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,471
Three years.

67
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,268
Three years.

68
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:29,494
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

69
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,797
Hey, Virge? Virge?

70
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:36,167
Yes? Oh, no! My makeup. My hair!

71
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,304
Hey, where is everybody?

72
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,306
- All I can see is...
- Hi, Ben!

73
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,476
I can hear children,
but I can't see any children.

74
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,343
Uncle Ben!

75
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:49,434
Uncle Ben!

76
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:52,099
Look at Uncle Ben!

77
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:55,560
Ben! Uncle Ben! Uncle Ben!

78
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,494
- What did you bring me?
- Open them and see.

79
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,317
- Come. Come.
- Go on and open them Kathy.

80
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:21,424
Take a look at this.

81
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,851
- It's highly theoretical, Ben.
- Theoretical?

82
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:41,232
Do I have to remind you that theory
is the beginning of solution?

83
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:51,030
"Is Europe's disease carried
on the wind?" Is it, Ben?

84
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,749
- It could be.
- And if it is?

85
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,247
It isn't, Virge.

86
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:00,552
Is that what you really think,
or just what you'd like to think?

87
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:04,473
I cannot accept half-baked theories
that sell newspapers.

88
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:07,684
I'm a scientist, not an alarmist.

89
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,686
You're whistling past the graveyard.

90
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,606
Is that a commentary on my work at the lab?

91
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:15,651
- We both know how hard you've worked.
- I'm sorry, Ben.

92
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:20,021
I just can't accept the idea
of universal disease.

93
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,284
Uncle Ben, you promised us card tricks.

94
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,857
All right, Kathy. Who can resist that face?

95
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:32,363
All right. Card tricks. Card tricks.

96
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,046
Robert...

97
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:39,995
Is it possible this germ,
or virus, could be airborne?

98
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:44,048
Anything is possible, Virge.

99
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:48,225
The best brains in the world have
been running through this thing...

100
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,935
with a fine-toothed comb.

101
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,145
The germ is visible under a microscope...

102
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:55,593
but it's not like any bacilli
I've ever known.

103
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:57,901
In what way?

104
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:02,351
It can't be destroyed by any process
we've been able to uncover.

105
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:07,071
But with the whole world trying,
there must be a solution.

106
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,734
Mommy, when are we gonna cut the cake?

107
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:15,368
Right now our problem is to cut that cake.

108
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:21,165
- Hey, Mommy. Mommy!
- Coming. Coming.

109
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,220
The wind wake you up?

110
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,180
It always does.

111
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,933
- How do you feel?
- I'm all right.

112
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:56,144
- Don't get up, honey.
- I'm not sick, Bob.

113
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,605
- I'll make your breakfast.
- You don't have to.

114
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,775
I'll be all right. Go on and read your paper.

115
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,562
All right.

116
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:49,364
Sweetheart, look, if you don't feel well,
please go back to bed.

117
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,357
I'm just a little tired, that's all.

118
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:56,032
I wish somebody would find a vaccine.

119
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,736
It's all we're working on at the lab, Virge.

120
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,914
Maybe you better not send her
to school today.

121
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,997
All right.

122
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:11,344
- Do you think you should go to work?
- I have to.

123
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,346
Bob?

124
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:17,010
Bob, I'm so frightened.

125
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:21,716
Everything's going to be
all right, sweetheart.

126
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:56,338
- Well?
- The bacilli are multiplying.

127
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,643
That kicks the bone marrow
theory in the head.

128
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:01,978
This specimen shows a higher white count...

129
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,766
than when I put it on the slide.

130
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:09,146
Those cells are still living,
Dr. Mercer, off one another.

131
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,821
There has to be an answer.

132
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:15,367
You've heard that all communications
are ended outside the continental limits?

133
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,660
Yes, I heard.

134
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:20,984
That leaves it in our laps.
So we keep trying. Where's Cortman?

135
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,542
Well, he should be here by now.

136
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:27,045
You two stay on this virus theory
until I decide it's exhausted.

137
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,616
Right.

138
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,259
- Yes, sir?
- Morgan will fill you in.

139
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,205
All right, sir.

140
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:40,559
And what did the great man of science
have to say today? More of the usual?

141
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,395
Oh, he's trying, Ben.
Just like the rest of us.

142
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,512
And nothing works.

143
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:48,400
The streets are swarming
with truckloads of bodies...

144
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,236
that they're throwing
into that God-awful pit.

145
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,154
And the dedicated Dr. Mercer goes on...

146
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:56,032
with his plodding, unimaginative approach.

147
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,994
- You have a better idea?
- Maybe.

148
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:02,747
- At least it involves imagination.
- Ben, it's as simple as this.

149
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:06,001
An unknown germ is being blown
around the world.

150
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,504
It's highly contagious,
and it's reached plague proportions.

151
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:13,049
And you don't believe some
of the dead have come back?

152
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,212
Let's get to work.

153
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:20,932
And why are they burning the bodies?
Why don't they bury them?

154
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,935
Because it's the best known way
to control the contagion...

155
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,979
to keep the germ from spreading.

156
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:28,648
That's what we've always
believed, at any rate.

157
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:32,893
- You'd prefer us to believe in vampires?
- If they exist, yes.

158
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,947
There are stories being told, Bob.

159
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,117
By people who are
out of their minds with fear!

160
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:43,532
Maybe, but there are too many
to be just coincidental.

161
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:49,210
Stories about people who have died,
and have come back.

162
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,296
They're stories, Ben, stories.

163
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:55,634
And why are the infected people
always so tired in the daytime?

164
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:58,386
Why can't they stand the sunlight?

165
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,209
Why are they only seen at night?

166
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,420
Come here.

167
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,772
- Look.
- I know as well as...

168
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:09,933
Look!

169
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,945
- Now, is this bacilli or isn't it?
- It doesn't alter...

170
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:20,367
And this bacilli is found in the blood
of every infected person, or isn't it?

171
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:23,620
To show me germs is not
to refute these stories, Bob.

172
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:28,195
The point is, if there are vampires,
they exist in spite of these germs.

173
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,947
Come on, let's get to work.

174
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,054
Until further notice this station...

175
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:45,100
will continue its around-the-clock
coverage of this national disaster.

176
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,561
And now we switch you to the state capitol...

177
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,398
where His Excellency, the Governor

178
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:54,596
is speaking from the executive mansion.

179
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:59,364
Further, I have in conjunction
with the Federal Government...

180
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:02,575
declared this state to be a disaster area.

181
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:06,496
The public health is dependent on
the bodies of the deceased being burned.

182
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:09,082
You must notify the Health
Department immediately...

183
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:11,167
if you have a plague victim in your home.

184
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,753
Under no circumstances
should you gather publicly.

185
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,826
In view of the dire emergency
that exists, I intend to...

186
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,087
Anything new?

187
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,961
No, nothing new.

188
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,471
Nothing.

189
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,192
Mommy, where are you?

190
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,859
Mommy, I can't see.

191
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,031
Mommy...

192
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,620
- I'm going to call the doctor.
- I said no.

193
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,178
Virge, there's nothing they can do.

194
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:07,682
- But we can't just let her lie there.
- Well, this way she has a chance.

195
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:11,972
If you call a doctor, he'll report it.
Do you want that?

196
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:19,389
Mommy, help me.

197
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,394
Mommy...

198
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,105
Mommy, please help me.

199
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,069
Mommy, help me.

200
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:31,450
- How can you be so sure she's...
- Blindness is one of the symptoms.

201
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:35,835
You're not to call a doctor
under any circumstances.

202
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:39,659
No one is to come into this house.
Now remember that.

203
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,208
Mommy... Mommy...

204
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,506
Mommy, where are you?

205
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:52,756
I've got to pick Ben Cortman up
on the way to the lab.

206
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:56,426
No one is to come into this house.

207
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,811
Now remember that!

208
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:17,492
No! No! No! Please!

209
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,953
Please don't let him be buried in the pit.

210
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:28,847
Please, for God's sake.
Don't take him away like this.

211
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,715
You can't! You can't!

212
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,795
- Who's there?
- It's me, Ben. We're late.

213
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,898
Ben, what's the matter with you?

214
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,358
Nothing. And I'm going to keep it that way.

215
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:26,933
- Ben! Look, let's talk about this.
- There's nothing to talk about.

216
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:32,063
You think I'm out of my mind.
You laughed at me and my theory.

217
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,245
You might be one of them.

218
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,497
Ben, look, you're ill.
You ought to see a doctor.

219
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,374
No doctors.

220
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:41,669
You take care of your life.
I'll take care of mine.

221
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,047
Now get away from here.

222
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:46,961
You understand? Get away from here!

223
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:06,324
If you're looking for
anybody but me, forget it.

224
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:15,888
- Are they all gone?
- That's right.

225
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:19,183
Is there any hope from the latest reports?

226
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,471
No, not yet.

227
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:25,023
But believe me, Morgan, we'll find an answer.

228
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:28,562
When, Doctor?
We need it right now. I need it!

229
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:33,072
You're the only one who wasn't
afraid to come here today.

230
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:36,065
What's going to happen, Dr. Mercer?

231
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:41,039
Is everybody in the world going to die
before someone finds the answer?

232
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,327
No, I don't think so.

233
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:49,124
I don't deny that there's some strange
evolutionary process going on.

234
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,467
But mankind won't be destroyed.

235
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:56,166
The fact that you and I
are working here today...

236
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,879
is evidence of that.

237
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:20,026
All right. Let's roll.

238
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,061
When?

239
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,449
When?

240
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,618
I called a doctor. I had to.

241
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,162
I told you not to call anyone.

242
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:06,110
Bob, she was blind.

243
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,334
She couldn't see.

244
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:12,158
She kept reaching out her hands,
and groping for me.

245
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:17,796
And all of a sudden she was gone.

246
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:21,889
And they came...

247
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:24,976
and I tried to stop them. They took her.

248
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,469
I saw a truck out there.

249
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:31,023
Was that it? Was it?

250
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,639
Yes.

251
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:48,207
I'm sorry, lady. There's nothing I can do.

252
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:51,252
Let that truck through. Get out of the way.

253
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:54,621
Get back, folks. Nobody's allowed out there.

254
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:58,259
Please, all of you. Get behind those lines.

255
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:01,628
Look sharp there. Move. Move along.

256
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:07,509
Make way for that truck. This way.

257
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:13,260
Hey, you, mister! Come back!

258
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,288
Did this truck just come in
from Market Street?

259
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:30,166
I said, did this truck just come in
from Market Street?

260
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:32,454
Mister, I don't know.

261
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:50,714
Hey, you don't belong in here. Get out.

262
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,273
- I said get out!
- I want my daughter.

263
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,972
Mister, a lot of daughters
are in there, including my own.

264
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,886
Bob, I can't see!

265
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:39,896
I can't see!

266
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:43,642
Virge!

267
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,092
Virge.

268
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:32,945
No.

269
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:37,120
I won't let them put you there, Virge.

270
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,036
I promise.

271
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:44,085
I won't let them put you there.

272
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,411
Let me in.

273
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,622
Let me in.

274
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,425
Let me in.

275
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:01,222
Let me in.

276
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,930
Let me in.

277
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:17,652
Let me in.

278
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:30,285
Who is it?

279
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,417
Who's there?

280
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:04,445
Robert.

281
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:07,201
Robert.

282
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:14,287
Robert.

283
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,869
Morgan.

284
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:44,283
We're going to kill you, Morgan.

285
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:48,451
Morgan? Do you hear?

286
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:51,204
Morgan.

287
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:55,753
Morgan!

288
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,457
Do you hear, Morgan?

289
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:04,884
Morgan? Do you hear, Morgan?

290
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:03,535
If Cortman thinks he can get to me
by destroying my car...

291
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:06,028
his wits are getting dull.

292
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:13,462
This convertible would be nice.

293
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:15,881
Probably handles well.

294
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,258
But I can't think of comfort.

295
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:21,595
There was a time when I shopped for a car...

296
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:24,348
but now I'm looking for a hearse.

297
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:27,387
This station wagon will have to do.

298
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:12,549
Alive.

299
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,850
It's alive!

300
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:22,865
Wait. Don't run away!

301
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:24,700
Come back here.

302
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:27,022
Don't run away!

303
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:35,204
Come back. Come back here!

304
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:39,965
Wherever he is, I've got to find him.

305
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:42,843
If I have to search every street,
every house, every alley...

306
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:46,132
every inch of this town,
I've got to find him.

307
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:52,885
Come back!

308
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,308
Hey, boy, where are you?

309
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:08,730
Where are you, pal? Come here.

310
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:44,571
They're dead.

311
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,813
They've been staked!

312
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:59,448
But these are made of iron,
not wood like mine.

313
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,885
Someone else is alive in this world.

314
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:10,174
But where are they? Where are they hiding?

315
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:19,559
How many are there? Where did they come from?

316
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:22,141
Why haven't I seen them?

317
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:32,025
This is Robert Morgan.

318
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:37,114
If somebody can hear me, answer me.

319
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,538
For God's sake, answer me!

320
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:46,174
This is K-O-K-W calling.

321
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:48,416
K-O-K-W calling.

322
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:50,415
Answer me.

323
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:27,960
So you finally decided to come back.

324
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,552
It's alright boy.

325
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,544
Good boy.

326
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,835
Oh, no.

327
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,386
Don't worry, boy.

328
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:45,099
You're going to be all right. Yes, you are.

329
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:01,866
There now, we've got you all cleaned up.

330
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:04,920
You're gonna feel better.

331
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,869
Gonna put you down here now and you can rest.

332
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:12,000
Got you all cleaned up.

333
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:32,197
You know they're out there, don't you?

334
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:35,236
You poor driven thing.

335
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:43,536
Everything's going to be all right.

336
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:46,322
Nobody's going to hurt you.

337
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,913
Everything's going to be all right.

338
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,499
All right.

339
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:55,220
You're going to get better.

340
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,213
We're going to have lots
of happy times together.

341
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:02,385
You'll see. Everything's going to be fine.

342
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,604
What's the use?

343
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:04,761
Wait, I'm not going to hurt you.
Can't you understand? Wait!

344
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,236
Wait.

345
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:30,869
I'm not going to hurt you. Wait.

346
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:35,922
I couldn't be out here in the daylight
if I was one of them.

347
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:39,461
You know that they
can't come out until sundown.

348
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:43,879
Do you want to come with me,
or do you want to face them?

349
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:17,260
- You feeling better?
- Yes.

350
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:21,309
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Thank you.

351
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:37,997
- You seem very well organized here.
- Yeah.

352
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,122
My name is Ruth Collins.

353
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:46,796
I was married.

354
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:50,676
I lost my husband.

355
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:55,176
You are alone?

356
01:04:57,644 --> 01:04:59,931
- You were married?
- Yes.

357
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:02,562
Children?

358
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,687
A daughter.

359
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,457
What are you doing?

360
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:35,226
Please, stop! Stop it, please!

361
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:37,103
You're making me sick.

362
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:40,551
Why do you turn away? Why do you turn away?

363
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:50,899
- You are infected.
- No.

364
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:57,031
Infected systems are allergic to garlic.

365
01:05:57,745 --> 01:06:00,909
- You think I'm one of them.
- You will be.

366
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:06,049
You've made up your mind just because I...

367
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:08,593
You can't change the facts by talking.

368
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:11,461
Facts? What facts?

369
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:14,099
That I got sick?

370
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:16,643
I've had a sensitive stomach all my life.

371
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:21,022
I saw my husband killed. Torn to pieces,
right in front of our house.

372
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:23,441
I've been wandering ever since.

373
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:26,820
Hiding at night. Not eating more than scraps.

374
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:31,770
Sick with mourning,
sick with fear, unable to sleep.

375
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:34,869
Then you shout at me.

376
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:37,414
You chase me across the field, hit me...

377
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:40,083
drag me to this house, and to top it all...

378
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:43,920
when I get sick because you shove
a piece of reeking garlic in my face...

379
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,367
you tell me I'm infected.

380
01:06:48,213 --> 01:06:49,801
- Where are you going?
- Let me go.

381
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:51,511
You can't go out there. It's almost sunset.

382
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:53,346
- Let me go, I said.
- You can't go out there now.

383
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:56,724
In a few minutes the streets
will be full of them.

384
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:59,686
- I don't care.
- At least let me give you a blood test.

385
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:01,678
Don't touch me.

386
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:05,143
Don't touch me.

387
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:08,351
Don't touch me.

388
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:21,068
You must be hungry. I'll fix you some dinner.

389
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:43,262
- You know, you should eat.
- I can't.

390
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:02,530
- You seem used to them.
- As much as anybody could be.

391
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:06,669
I'm not frightened of them anymore,
if that's what you mean.

392
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:10,924
I protect myself against them,
but only because there are so many.

393
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:13,176
Individually, they're weak.

394
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:16,721
Mentally incompetent,
like animals after a long famine.

395
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:18,473
If they weren't...

396
01:08:18,553 --> 01:08:22,644
they surely would've found a way
of breaking in here a long time ago.

397
01:08:22,724 --> 01:08:24,886
Come out, Morgan.

398
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:29,516
Hear that?

399
01:08:29,856 --> 01:08:32,018
That's Ben Cortman.

400
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:34,822
- He was my friend.
- Your friend?

401
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:36,908
He was like a kid brother.

402
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:40,106
If I could find him and destroy him...

403
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:43,164
But you said he was your friend.

404
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:47,705
When I find him I'll drive a stake
through him, just like all the others.

405
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:57,586
But you lived through all this.
Do you know why?

406
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:00,918
Perhaps I was chosen.

407
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:04,512
That's a laugh.

408
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:09,524
Or perhaps it's because a long time ago
when I worked in Panama...

409
01:09:09,604 --> 01:09:12,312
I was bitten in my sleep by a bat.

410
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,772
My theory is that the...

411
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:18,199
the bat had previously
acquired the vampire germ.

412
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:19,993
By the time it entered my blood...

413
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:22,745
it had been strained and weakened
by the bat's system.

414
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:26,614
As a result, I have immunity.

415
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:31,206
It's only a guess,
but it's all I have to go on.

416
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:39,128
You don't think that I'm immune, do you?

417
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:42,676
It's a simple matter to find out
whether you are or not.

418
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:53,225
What will you do if I am infected?

419
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:55,389
Cure me?

420
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,657
You don't have to answer.

421
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:02,195
I know as well as you do...

422
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:04,912
it's incurable.

423
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:06,914
There might be a way.

424
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:12,035
If not of killing the germ, at least of
containing it, keeping it from spreading.

425
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:15,872
If I had the equipment, the time.

426
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:18,791
Which you don't.

427
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,470
You are one of them.

428
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:06,669
I was. And without that injection,
I'll be one again.

429
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:08,976
What do you mean?

430
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:12,174
- You found a solution?
- That's right.

431
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:15,015
Exactly as you said it could be.

432
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:17,892
I take that for it.

433
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:21,600
What is it?

434
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,899
Defibrinated blood, plus vaccine.

435
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:27,787
The blood feeds the germ...

436
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:30,373
the vaccine keeps it isolated...

437
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:33,241
and prevents it from multiplying.

438
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:37,909
We've had it for some time now.

439
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:39,626
We?

440
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:40,925
We?

441
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:43,748
There are quite a number of us.

442
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:47,380
And I thought you were alone.

443
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:50,050
I was going to cure you.

444
01:11:50,515 --> 01:11:52,928
- Does that amuse you?
- No.

445
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:57,765
Now, I want the truth.

446
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:01,738
I want all of it. Why are you here?

447
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:04,449
To find out if you know any more than we do.

448
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:06,242
You know far less.

449
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:10,066
We're alive. Infected, yes. But alive.

450
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:13,152
We're going to reorganize society.

451
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:18,129
Do away with all those wretched creatures
who are neither alive nor dead.

452
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:21,043
Start everything all over again.

453
01:12:22,255 --> 01:12:24,417
And you want me to join?

454
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:27,054
You can't join us.

455
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:29,390
You're a monster to them.

456
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:32,101
Why do you think I ran when I saw you?

457
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:34,729
Even though I was assigned to spy on you.

458
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:38,274
Because I was so terrified
of what I'd heard about you.

459
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:42,473
You're a legend in the city.
Living by day instead of night.

460
01:12:42,817 --> 01:12:46,491
Leaving, as evidence of your
existence, bloodless corpses.

461
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:50,110
Many of the people you destroyed
were still alive.

462
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:54,531
Many of them were loved ones
of the people in my group.

463
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:57,418
I didn't know.

464
01:12:57,498 --> 01:13:01,075
- Is there any way you can get out of here?
- What do you mean?

465
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:04,091
They're coming after you tonight.

466
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:09,430
That's why I was sent here.
To prevent you from resisting them.

467
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:15,381
I'm supposed to keep you here
until they come.

468
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:19,263
- To kill me?
- Yes.

469
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,354
Your new society sounds charming.

470
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:26,823
The beginning of any society
is never charming or gentle.

471
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:30,692
And you pretended to be
shocked at my violence.

472
01:13:31,282 --> 01:13:33,621
Well, what are you waiting for?

473
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:37,124
Why don't you go on and use it?
Get it over with. Use it!

474
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:39,161
Get it over with!

475
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:51,591
Now you know.

476
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:57,469
What are you going to do?

477
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:42,452
- What are you doing?
- It's already done.

478
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:44,329
What?

479
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:53,209
Look.

480
01:15:53,591 --> 01:15:55,207
Look!

481
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:12,266
You see? It worked, Ruth.

482
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:15,981
The antibodies in my blood worked.

483
01:16:16,322 --> 01:16:18,828
My blood has saved you, Ruth.

484
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:23,778
Do you know what this means?
You and I can save all the others.

485
01:16:24,038 --> 01:16:27,702
We won't be alone.
We'll never be alone again.

486
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:30,667
You are sure?

487
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:33,082
Wait.

488
01:16:50,231 --> 01:16:52,439
Don't be afraid.

489
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:20,473
- Where are you going?
- I have to get out of here...

490
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:22,433
- and tell them you're not a threat to us.
- You can't go out there.

491
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:25,311
You can save all of us.
When they come here there won't be time...

492
01:17:25,391 --> 01:17:28,314
for questions and answers.
They'll come to kill.

493
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:32,068
For God's sake, Robert, let me go.
Oh, Robert, please.

494
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:34,640
Ruth, look. Tomorrow.

495
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:38,199
Please. Robert.

496
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:41,898
Tomorrow, Ruth. Tomorrow will be all right.

497
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:45,154
Robert, no.

498
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:08,229
- Robert.
- Yes, Ruth?

499
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:11,848
- What if this doesn't last?
- But it will.

500
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:15,361
I've already checked it under the microscope.

501
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:17,603
Wait, I'll show you.

502
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:20,523
I'll prove it to you. I'll check it again.

503
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:45,715
Ruth, just take a look at this.

504
01:18:47,014 --> 01:18:48,853
This'll prove it to you.

505
01:18:48,933 --> 01:18:51,926
Ruth, there's no change.
I've double... checked.

506
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:54,803
- Robert!
- Ruth.

507
01:18:55,773 --> 01:18:57,730
- Ruth!
- Robert!

508
01:18:58,025 --> 01:18:59,113
Ruth!

509
01:18:59,193 --> 01:19:01,401
Get away from her.

510
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:04,702
Ruth, are you all right?

511
01:19:04,782 --> 01:19:06,774
Are you all right?

512
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:19,953
Run, Robert! Robert, run!

513
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:26,134
Run! They've come to kill you, Robert.

514
01:19:39,817 --> 01:19:41,809
Run! Run!

515
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:05,123
Up there!

516
01:20:22,026 --> 01:20:24,109
There he is.

517
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:28,735
Wait, you don't understand. Wait!

518
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:33,200
Get him! Get him!

519
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:44,996
Wait!

520
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:53,797
Surround the block. Move! Move!

521
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:07,283
This way. Hey, over here.

522
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:09,776
This way. Cover all sides!

523
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:09,831
Stand back.

524
01:22:58,056 --> 01:23:01,015
There he is! In the church!

525
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:08,773
Over there!

526
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:21,698
Hold your fire!

527
01:24:56,883 --> 01:24:58,715
Freaks!

528
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,641
All of you.

529
01:25:00,721 --> 01:25:04,214
All of you, freaks. Mutations.

530
01:25:12,983 --> 01:25:14,404
Hold it.

531
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:16,316
You're freaks.

532
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:18,565
I am a man.

533
01:25:19,156 --> 01:25:22,149
The last man.

534
01:25:24,745 --> 01:25:26,907
Robert!

535
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:32,034
They were afraid of me.

536
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:34,994
They were afraid of me.

537
01:25:35,839 --> 01:25:37,928
They were afraid of me.

538
01:25:38,008 --> 01:25:40,421
They didn't know.

539
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:22,514
Don't cry. There's nothing to cry about.

540
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:25,052
We're all safe now.

541
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:27,513
All safe.
