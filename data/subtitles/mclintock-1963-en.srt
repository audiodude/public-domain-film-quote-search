1
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:26,324
Love in the country

2
00:00:26,364 --> 00:00:29,760
Where skies are blue

3
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:34,296
All you'll be dreaming of

4
00:00:34,336 --> 00:00:36,763
Are the birds and the bees
and the flowers and the trees

5
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:39,561
Till you're up to
your knees in love

6
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:41,729
There's a treehouse
in the meadow

7
00:00:41,769 --> 00:00:43,926
Below the mountain peak

8
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:46,264
The perfect place for lovers

9
00:00:46,304 --> 00:00:48,062
When they play hide and seek

10
00:00:48,102 --> 00:00:49,961
There's a covered bridge
at Crippled Creek

11
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:52,398
Where the horses always stop

12
00:00:52,438 --> 00:00:53,557
'Tween the treehouse

13
00:00:53,597 --> 00:00:54,586
And the covered bridge

14
00:00:54,636 --> 00:00:56,225
That's how Mom won Pop

15
00:00:56,264 --> 00:01:00,101
By making love
in the country

16
00:01:01,669 --> 00:01:04,297
Where skies are blue

17
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:08,762
All you'll be dreaming of

18
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,500
Are the birds and the bees
and the flowers and the trees

19
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,267
Till you're up to
your knees in love

20
00:01:14,297 --> 00:01:16,765
There are roses
on the trellis

21
00:01:16,804 --> 00:01:18,773
And the scent
of new-mown hay

22
00:01:18,803 --> 00:01:21,030
The clingin' vine is jealous

23
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,198
On the fence across the way

24
00:01:23,238 --> 00:01:25,326
There's a great big yellow
moon above

25
00:01:25,366 --> 00:01:27,394
And a breeze to sing a song

26
00:01:27,434 --> 00:01:29,492
'Tween the roses
and the yellow moon

27
00:01:29,532 --> 00:01:30,761
A fella can't go wrong

28
00:01:30,801 --> 00:01:31,930
When he makes

29
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,938
Love in the country

30
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:39,203
Where skies are blue

31
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:44,298
All you'll be dreamin' of

32
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:46,356
Are the birds and the bees
and the flowers and the trees

33
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,373
Till you're up to
your knees in love!

34
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:25,060
Lord to goodness.
Not again.

35
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,936
- Howdy, Drago.
- Morning, Curly.

36
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,602
Makes seven times this month
he come home swaggled.

37
00:02:45,727 --> 00:02:46,852
- Six.
- Seven.

38
00:02:46,978 --> 00:02:49,144
Six. Once was his birthday.
That don't count.

39
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:50,560
Give me my buggy whip.

40
00:02:50,686 --> 00:02:53,936
Didn't have anything for breakfast
but two raw eggs and a mug of honey.

41
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:56,144
- No!
- Curly!

42
00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:57,602
Yes, Boss?

43
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:03,852
Don't say it's a fine morning,
or I'll shoot you.

44
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,769
Get out of here, Bunyan.

45
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:11,269
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

46
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:14,061
Carlos, what are you
doing up there?

47
00:03:14,186 --> 00:03:16,436
I hope I get it
this time, Mr. McLintock.

48
00:03:16,561 --> 00:03:19,520
My brothers... they got
the big hats already.

49
00:03:28,104 --> 00:03:30,062
All right. Let 'em have at it.

50
00:03:43,728 --> 00:03:44,812
Get over.

51
00:03:44,937 --> 00:03:47,688
Did you want to let me drive?
You promised me you would sometime.

52
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:48,853
No! Ya!

53
00:03:51,104 --> 00:03:53,354
Boss, you better
watch that turn on the road!

54
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:56,187
You're gonna kill
both of us one of these days.

55
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:02,063
Thank you, Mr. Boss!

56
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:21,230
You got cattle
in the bank, Boss.

57
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,018
Ya!

58
00:04:28,938 --> 00:04:30,188
Giddyap. Ya!

59
00:04:48,147 --> 00:04:49,356
Keep 'em going.

60
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,481
15 cents a pound
all the way to Kansas City.

61
00:04:55,472 --> 00:04:57,470
Ya! Ya!

62
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:42,666
Now, Boss, there's
one old pensioner...

63
00:05:43,165 --> 00:05:45,663
I wish you'd pass up.

64
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,315
- Bunny?
- Yeah.

65
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,357
Wish I knew where
I'd seen his face before.

66
00:05:52,482 --> 00:05:53,857
He ain't an old timer.

67
00:05:53,982 --> 00:05:55,941
He's just been around town
a couple of years.

68
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:58,732
Aw, you have no milk
of human kindness.

69
00:06:00,941 --> 00:06:02,649
Morning, Mr. McLintock.

70
00:06:02,774 --> 00:06:05,941
- Morning, Bunny.
- Well, I can see you're in good health.

71
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:09,690
Never felt better,
contrary to what you may hear.

72
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:13,233
My kidneys ain't
what they used to be,

73
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:16,982
and my liver's been leaving me bilious.
- Drago!

74
00:06:16,982 --> 00:06:18,980
Eh.

75
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:26,274
- Hello, Ben.
- Hey, McLintock.

76
00:06:29,358 --> 00:06:32,233
- Drago, throw that in the buggy.
- Yes, sir.

77
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:37,274
- That's a scrubby bunch of sooners, huh?
- They are at that.

78
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:43,067
That ought to make Douglas
happy, lining his pockets with land fees.

79
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:45,775
What are we going to do?

80
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:50,067
I don't know what you're gonna do, Ben.
Me... I do nothing.

81
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:54,400
200 families. Quarter of beef
a week per family.

82
00:06:54,858 --> 00:06:57,858
lf they last two years,
that can be a sizable number.

83
00:06:58,192 --> 00:07:00,810
I got 20 head to one of any...

84
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:03,651
other brand on the Mesa Verde.
I'm not hollering.

85
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:07,192
Some of us haven't got
all the money in the world.

86
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:11,068
Some of us ain't old and tired
and feel like being put upon.

87
00:07:11,192 --> 00:07:14,068
You interest me, Young Ben.
Go on.

88
00:07:14,526 --> 00:07:18,651
The first time I find one of
our hides wearing our brand...

89
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:23,151
hung on one of them settler's fences,
I aim to kill me a plow boy.

90
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:27,901
You do what you want, McLintock.
We'll do what we want.

91
00:07:28,527 --> 00:07:33,193
Fellas my age generally
call me "G.W." or "McLintock".

92
00:07:33,776 --> 00:07:36,276
Youngsters call me
"Mr. McLintock".

93
00:07:38,443 --> 00:07:40,526
All right, "Mr. McLintock",

94
00:07:40,652 --> 00:07:44,735
not because I'm afraid of you.
You're the big yeast out of this country,

95
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,110
and I reckon a fella my age
should call you "mister".

96
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:53,194
He's full grown now, G.W.
He's a half-owner of the spread.

97
00:07:54,443 --> 00:07:58,194
I made him a full partner,
the day the doc gave me the long face.

98
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,693
Well, you want him to vote...

99
00:07:59,818 --> 00:08:02,693
the first time this territory
becomes a state, don't you?

100
00:08:02,818 --> 00:08:04,361
Of course, I do.

101
00:08:04,486 --> 00:08:07,652
These settlers get burned out,
there'll be a lot of hollering...

102
00:08:07,777 --> 00:08:10,194
that this country's too wild
to be a state,

103
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,653
and we'll go on being
a territory some more,

104
00:08:13,778 --> 00:08:16,194
with a lot of political
appointees running it...

105
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,277
according to what they learned
in some college...

106
00:08:19,402 --> 00:08:22,361
where they think that cows
are something you milk,

107
00:08:22,486 --> 00:08:25,903
and lndians are something
in front of a cigar store.

108
00:08:26,736 --> 00:08:29,402
I'm looking to you
to hold Young Ben down.

109
00:08:29,527 --> 00:08:31,444
I'll do what I can.

110
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:36,778
Come on over to the house once in a while.
We'll rack up a few hands of stud.

111
00:08:36,903 --> 00:08:39,028
G.W., that'll be just fine.

112
00:08:50,403 --> 00:08:52,695
It's a nice morning,
ain't it, Boss?

113
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,070
Everybody's entitled
to their own opinion.

114
00:08:55,195 --> 00:08:58,403
Like that again, eh?
Here's something that'll cheer you up.

115
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:01,654
About 1,000 head. l figure
they'll bring about $1,250.

116
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:04,195
They're not as fat
as I'd like to ship.

117
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,154
- They all off the north range?
- Yes, sir.

118
00:09:09,946 --> 00:09:12,445
Settlers. Every one of them
with a plow and a Bible,

119
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,528
not the slightest idea
of what the range is for.

120
00:09:17,112 --> 00:09:18,279
Drago!

121
00:09:19,154 --> 00:09:21,654
- Drag out that hog-legg.
- Yes, sir.

122
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,820
Get me some attention.

123
00:09:24,849 --> 00:09:26,718
Hee ya!

124
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,655
People, people, people!

125
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,193
People!

126
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:39,112
Come on, all of you! Gather around.

127
00:09:39,696 --> 00:09:42,237
People, come on! Gather around.

128
00:09:45,446 --> 00:09:46,988
l'm McLintock.

129
00:09:47,197 --> 00:09:50,780
You people planned a homestead
and farmed the Mesa Verde.

130
00:09:50,905 --> 00:09:53,905
Yes, sir. The government
give us each 160 acres.

131
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,072
The government never gave
anybody anything.

132
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:59,655
Some years back,
a lot like you came in.

133
00:10:00,447 --> 00:10:04,364
They had a pretty good first year
good summer, easy winter.

134
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:08,322
But the next year,
the last rain was in February,

135
00:10:08,447 --> 00:10:12,530
and by June, even the jackrabbits had
sense enough to get off the Mesa.

136
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:16,530
Folks, do you know who that is? That's McLintock...

137
00:10:17,113 --> 00:10:19,530
"George Washington McLintock."

138
00:10:19,655 --> 00:10:21,739
I told them that, Douglas.

139
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:26,739
He controls the water rights,
on 200 square miles of range.

140
00:10:28,364 --> 00:10:31,323
You know that lumber you got?
That came from his land.

141
00:10:31,447 --> 00:10:34,822
Cut by his loggers
and milled in his mills.

142
00:10:34,947 --> 00:10:39,531
Douglas, I come close to killing you a
couple of times, when we were younger.

143
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:41,947
Saddens me I didn't.

144
00:10:42,073 --> 00:10:45,281
Can you imagine
a man who owns all that...

145
00:10:45,406 --> 00:10:48,448
Oh, and mines, too.
I forgot to mention them...

146
00:10:48,989 --> 00:10:53,313
All that, and he's begrudging
poor people a measly...

147
00:10:53,443 --> 00:10:56,490
a measly, 160 acres.

148
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,490
That right, Mr. McLintock?

149
00:10:58,615 --> 00:11:03,115
- You begrudge us a little free land?
- There's no such thing as free land.

150
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,907
If you make these homesteads go,
you'll have earned every acre of it,

151
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:10,157
but you just can't make 'em go
on the Mesa Verde.

152
00:11:10,615 --> 00:11:15,324
God made that country for buffalo.
It serves pretty well for cattle,

153
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:17,282
but it hates the plow.

154
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,616
And even the government
should know...

155
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,449
that you can't farm 6,000 feet
above sea level.

156
00:11:24,741 --> 00:11:27,783
- Any trouble, Mr. McLintock?
- No trouble, Sheriff.

157
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:40,158
- How about you, Douglas?
- "Douglas?"

158
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:45,158
Just plain "Douglas," eh?
And you call him "Mr. McLintock".

159
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:46,783
Why?

160
00:11:47,657 --> 00:11:50,657
Well, "Douglas," I guess
it's because he earned it.

161
00:11:58,033 --> 00:12:00,241
- Mr. McLintock?
- Yeah?

162
00:12:00,824 --> 00:12:04,033
I'm a good hand with cattle, Mr. McLintock.
I'd like a job.

163
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:08,074
Well, you look strong enough.
You come in with those sooners?

164
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,825
Well, yes, sir, but we don't
have a homestead.

165
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,575
Can't use you.

166
00:12:27,825 --> 00:12:29,950
Tough life, ain't it, sonny?

167
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,659
Well, ain't much future in being
a farmer around these parts.

168
00:12:56,118 --> 00:12:59,409
Ladies, this is the finest chantilly lace,
available anywhere.

169
00:12:59,534 --> 00:13:03,285
<i>"Chantilly", Mr. Birnbaum.
- Well, believe me, it's the best.</i>

170
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:06,784
Oh, excuse me. Please, look around.
Take your time.

171
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:10,535
Drago, I got 1,000 Havana cigars,
and 12 of those hats for you over there.

172
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:14,096
Them big hats ain't going to
last long the way some folks...

173
00:13:14,216 --> 00:13:16,452
have been dipping
into that redeye these days.

174
00:13:16,983 --> 00:13:17,962
Uh-oh.

175
00:13:18,702 --> 00:13:19,827
Good morning, G.W.

176
00:13:19,951 --> 00:13:21,993
Good morning.
I stole some stick candy.

177
00:13:22,118 --> 00:13:24,494
Please. Help yourself.
Come on in.

178
00:13:27,911 --> 00:13:32,036
Davey! You can forget about
saddling up the horse!

179
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:33,367
Come in here!

180
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:35,325
- Problem?
- Yes.

181
00:13:35,368 --> 00:13:39,493
Well, if I were blacks, I'd move
queen's bishop to king 4.

182
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:44,286
Yeah. You might be right.

183
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:47,203
You know, I was just starting to work this out
when the letter came.

184
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:48,328
Letter?

185
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,578
- It was...
- What happened? Don't you want...

186
00:13:50,702 --> 00:13:52,703
- Morning, Mr. McLintock.
- Morning, Davey.

187
00:13:52,827 --> 00:13:55,119
You being here
saved me a trip.

188
00:13:55,952 --> 00:13:58,870
Oh, that hat and suit of clothes
you picked out for my birthday...

189
00:13:58,994 --> 00:14:01,745
well, instead of
this cowboy hat,

190
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:06,203
I'd like to have this one, if it's,
uh, all right with you, sir.

191
00:14:06,328 --> 00:14:08,078
Well, it's all right
with me, Davey.

192
00:14:08,203 --> 00:14:10,078
Of course, that looks like
the kind of a hat...

193
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:12,739
a fella'd wear down Main Street
to start a fight

194
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:14,494
Oh, l don't need
a city hat for that.

195
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,369
All l have to do
is walk down the street,

196
00:14:16,494 --> 00:14:19,912
and some wiseacre will call me an "Indian",
and, just like that, the fight's on.

197
00:14:20,037 --> 00:14:24,120
Davey, the letter. It's for you.
And you are an Indian.

198
00:14:24,786 --> 00:14:28,870
Yes, l know I'm an Indian,
but I'm also the fastest runner in town.

199
00:14:28,995 --> 00:14:32,203
I've got a college education,
and I'm the railroad telegrapher,

200
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,662
but does anybody say, "Hello, college man"
or "Hello, runner"...

201
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:39,203
or "Hello, telegrapher"? No!
Not even "Hello, knothead..."

202
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:40,370
Davey.

203
00:14:40,495 --> 00:14:42,704
It's always,
"Let the Indian do it."

204
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:44,662
Will you go out in
the store and help the ladies?

205
00:14:44,787 --> 00:14:48,662
All right. I'm also
a bookkeeper, part-time clerk.

206
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:52,329
Always, "Let the Indian do it."

207
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,871
A lady brought that
out here this morning,

208
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:58,871
asked for it to be taken out
to the home ranch for you.

209
00:14:58,996 --> 00:15:01,787
Handsome lady.
Kind of tall with red hair.

210
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,496
Called me "Mr. Birnbaum", just as
if she'd never seen me before...

211
00:15:05,622 --> 00:15:09,705
and as if that veil that covered her face
could keep me from recognizing her.

212
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:13,788
I thought she was in New York
or Europe or someplace.

213
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:15,371
So did l.

214
00:15:15,496 --> 00:15:19,371
Jake, you better throw on a couple
extra cases of the bosses favorite bourbon.

215
00:15:19,496 --> 00:15:22,496
That stuff sure gets used up
fast out at our place.

216
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:26,246
Which reminds me,
you better start tapering off.

217
00:15:26,277 --> 00:15:27,237
Huh!

218
00:15:29,247 --> 00:15:31,830
- Katherine's in town.
- Katie?!

219
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:41,497
Ladies.

220
00:15:42,623 --> 00:15:43,872
Good morning.

221
00:15:48,623 --> 00:15:51,664
Morning, Mr. McLintock.
Morning, Mr. McLintock.

222
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:01,539
- Morning.
- Good morning.

223
00:16:01,664 --> 00:16:03,706
- Morning.
- Fauntleroy.

224
00:16:04,081 --> 00:16:05,165
Morning, G.W.

225
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:07,581
What are you doing in here?
Why aren't you out at the desk?

226
00:16:07,706 --> 00:16:08,998
Helping out the bartender.

227
00:16:09,123 --> 00:16:12,622
Yeah, I see. A busy day.
Give me the key to room 17.

228
00:16:12,748 --> 00:16:13,956
What?

229
00:16:14,457 --> 00:16:16,581
17, and don't advertise it.

230
00:16:19,914 --> 00:16:22,206
Here they come,
Mr. McLintock.

231
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:27,081
Set 'em up.

232
00:16:27,206 --> 00:16:28,623
- Beer.
- Whiskey.

233
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,332
Day off?

234
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:35,248
Off day.

235
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,248
Wonder what he's
so preoccupied about.

236
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:42,749
- Haven't you heard?
- No. What?

237
00:16:42,874 --> 00:16:45,124
- Katie's back in town.
- Katie?

238
00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:47,874
Yes, dear.
The social arbiter.

239
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:52,540
- Well, hi, sonny.
- Good morning. Oh!

240
00:16:55,374 --> 00:16:56,623
He sure is a polite one.

241
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,832
Mr. McLintock, l don't
want to bother you...

242
00:16:58,957 --> 00:17:01,666
I'm sorry, boy.
l told you, no job.

243
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:37,542
Katherine.

244
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,417
George Washington McLintock.

245
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:50,250
I thought you'd want this.

246
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,459
First dig of the spur,

247
00:17:58,001 --> 00:18:00,751
but who am I
to upset your plans?

248
00:18:02,293 --> 00:18:06,209
- Don't you feel kind of silly?
- I never feel silly.

249
00:18:07,168 --> 00:18:09,460
It's because you have
no sense of humor.

250
00:18:09,584 --> 00:18:12,751
Why couldn't we sit down
in the hotel dining room...

251
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:15,126
and talk about whatever it is
you want to talk about?

252
00:18:15,251 --> 00:18:17,585
Or why couldn't you just come
over to the house?

253
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,792
And have everybody know
that we're meeting?

254
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:23,543
Everybody knows, and what's
the difference? We're married.

255
00:18:23,835 --> 00:18:26,960
That is something
I should like to change.

256
00:18:33,293 --> 00:18:35,251
You know the answer, Katie.

257
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,918
That isn't why you sent for me.

258
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,210
Let's get to the rat killing.

259
00:18:42,043 --> 00:18:46,252
That's just the kind of remark
that's always endeared you to me.

260
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:49,350
Let us open the discussion.

261
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:54,377
Very well. Our daughter is coming home in a
few days, or, rather, she's coming here.

262
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:58,918
It was just a slip of the tongue that made me
refer to this ugly hamlet as home.

263
00:18:59,127 --> 00:19:02,669
"Our daughter?" ls it so hard
to say her name? It's Becky.

264
00:19:02,794 --> 00:19:05,252
Rebecca! l hate that name.

265
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,044
Anyway, she's coming home,

266
00:19:08,627 --> 00:19:12,003
and l hoped to persuade you
to let her live with me...

267
00:19:12,128 --> 00:19:15,086
part of the time in the capital,
part of the time in New York,

268
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:18,377
and, of course,
Newport during the season.

269
00:19:20,295 --> 00:19:23,253
You're whistling
in the wind, Katie.

270
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:25,044
If she stays here,

271
00:19:25,544 --> 00:19:28,295
she'll become just as crude and as vulgar,
as all of this country.

272
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,919
And if she goes your way,
she'll be all show and no stay.

273
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:32,917
Oh.

274
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:41,295
No go, Kate.

275
00:19:42,128 --> 00:19:45,253
l hate you.
Oh, how l hate you!

276
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:49,004
Half the people
in the world are women.

277
00:19:49,628 --> 00:19:52,503
Why does it have to be you
that stirs me?

278
00:19:55,296 --> 00:19:58,004
- You animal.
- That's the story.

279
00:19:58,628 --> 00:20:01,795
l saw your picture in the paper
at the Governor's Ball.

280
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,254
You were dancing
with the governor.

281
00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:06,171
At least he's a gentleman.

282
00:20:06,296 --> 00:20:07,920
l doubt that.

283
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:11,045
You have to be a man first
before you're a gentleman.

284
00:20:11,171 --> 00:20:13,087
He misses on both counts.

285
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:36,838
- Hey, sonny, you gonna ask him again?
- Nope.

286
00:20:37,255 --> 00:20:41,005
Hey, boy, you got to pocket your pride.
You got to beg.

287
00:20:42,046 --> 00:20:43,547
You better listen to an expert, sonny.

288
00:20:43,671 --> 00:20:47,630
I'm telling you. You got to grovel.
Human nature. Gets 'em every time.

289
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,005
Mister, leave me alone.

290
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:55,755
Everybody does it
one way or another.

291
00:20:55,777 --> 00:20:57,745
Heh heh heh!

292
00:21:03,672 --> 00:21:05,422
About that job,
Mr. McLintock.

293
00:21:05,547 --> 00:21:08,839
l already told you, son,
I've got no need for farmers...

294
00:21:08,964 --> 00:21:12,256
- or use for 'em.
- Just one minute, Mr. McLintock.

295
00:21:12,589 --> 00:21:16,256
My father died last month.
That's how come we lost our homestead.

296
00:21:16,547 --> 00:21:20,672
I've got a mother and a little sister to feed.
I need that job badly.

297
00:21:20,797 --> 00:21:23,256
- What's your name?
- Devlin Warren.

298
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:24,922
Well, you got a job, son.

299
00:21:25,047 --> 00:21:27,880
See my home ranch foreman.
He's over at the corral.

300
00:21:34,214 --> 00:21:36,923
Step down off of
that carriage, mister.

301
00:21:42,423 --> 00:21:44,048
Hold that hog-legg.

302
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:50,381
I've been punched many a time in my life,
but never for hiring anybody.

303
00:21:52,132 --> 00:21:54,257
Aw, I don't know what to say.

304
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:58,465
l never begged before.
It turned my stomach.

305
00:21:59,715 --> 00:22:02,632
I suppose I should have been
grateful you gave me the job.

306
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:06,382
"Gave?"
Boy, you got it all wrong.

307
00:22:07,257 --> 00:22:10,090
I don't "give" jobs.
I hire men.

308
00:22:10,632 --> 00:22:13,465
You intend to give this man a full day's work,
don't you, boy?

309
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,841
You mean you're still
hiring me, Mr. McLintock?

310
00:22:15,966 --> 00:22:19,465
Well, yes, sir. I mean,
I'll certainly deliver a fair day's work.

311
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,465
For that,
I'll pay you a fair day's wage.

312
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:25,841
You won't "give" me anything,
and I won't "give" you anything.

313
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:28,966
We both hold up our heads.
Where do you live?

314
00:22:29,091 --> 00:22:31,258
The settler's encampment
down by the mine.

315
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,508
- That your plug?
- Yes, sir.

316
00:22:34,632 --> 00:22:37,674
Well, hop on him,
and we'll go get your gear.

317
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:46,759
Ya... Ya!

318
00:23:08,175 --> 00:23:11,217
- Morning, Mr. McLintock.
- Morning.

319
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:33,092
l am sure that all you
fine people are interested...

320
00:23:33,217 --> 00:23:37,551
in knowing just what portion of this new land
will be your new home.

321
00:23:39,098 --> 00:23:43,592
Oh, uh... Jones and McCallister, since you've
been more or less the leaders of our group,

322
00:23:43,718 --> 00:23:47,676
I'd like to have you come up
and check the exact location.

323
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:50,968
Won't be a minute, sir.

324
00:23:57,009 --> 00:23:59,760
Go after that boy
and give him $30.

325
00:24:00,385 --> 00:24:03,427
Tell him McLintock pays
his riders a month in advance.

326
00:24:03,552 --> 00:24:06,385
From the looks of things
they could sure use it, too.

327
00:24:09,301 --> 00:24:11,552
Oh, Ma,
this is Mr. Drago.

328
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:13,427
Good morning.

329
00:24:14,635 --> 00:24:18,427
Well, and to what do we
owe this visit from the cattle baron?

330
00:24:18,927 --> 00:24:22,427
I've got a touch of hangover,
bureaucrat. Don't push me.

331
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,760
Whoa-ho, McLin!

332
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,594
Say, those are Indians.

333
00:24:33,718 --> 00:24:35,469
Are there Indians
in this homestead land?

334
00:24:35,594 --> 00:24:37,428
Friendly Indians, my boy.

335
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:42,136
- Whoa-ho, McLin.
- Whoa-ho, Running Buffalo.

336
00:24:43,136 --> 00:24:47,011
Ho, McLin. Long time we don't
get drunk together.

337
00:24:47,136 --> 00:24:49,719
And it's going to be
a lot longer time...

338
00:24:49,845 --> 00:24:52,428
because it's against the law,
and you're with the sheriff.

339
00:24:52,553 --> 00:24:54,137
And have I got my hands full.

340
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:57,678
They came into town to meet the train.
The old Indian chiefs are coming home.

341
00:24:57,803 --> 00:24:59,428
l heard they'd been pardoned.

342
00:24:59,553 --> 00:25:02,594
They don't know when it's arriving,
this week, next week, or next month,

343
00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:04,970
so, in the meantime, I've got to
do something with them.

344
00:25:05,095 --> 00:25:07,636
Could I cut out a couple of head
of your steers to feed them?

345
00:25:07,761 --> 00:25:10,678
Otherwise, some of these settler's
milk cows are going to disappear.

346
00:25:10,803 --> 00:25:14,429
- That's right, McLin.
- Ha ha ha! Cut out whatever you need.

347
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:18,762
Sheriff, are you going to encamp these
savages with all these settlers?

348
00:25:18,886 --> 00:25:20,846
You're asking for trouble.

349
00:25:21,011 --> 00:25:23,762
Mr. Douglas, I already have
plenty of trouble.

350
00:25:23,887 --> 00:25:25,512
Please stay off my back.

351
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,720
Running Buffalo, bring your
people over to the clay slide.

352
00:25:33,428 --> 00:25:35,096
Hello, Mr. McLin.

353
00:25:35,221 --> 00:25:38,304
Tiny Mouth, it's nice to see you!

354
00:25:38,428 --> 00:25:39,762
You wouldn't believe it now,

355
00:25:39,887 --> 00:25:42,971
but 20 years ago, she was
a mighty handsome maid.

356
00:25:44,471 --> 00:25:47,762
20 years ago, you
thought so, too, Mr. Douglas.

357
00:25:49,461 --> 00:25:51,259
Ahem.

358
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:52,288
Ahem.

359
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:59,138
It was just like this. I had a
dead bead on old Running Buffalo,

360
00:25:59,263 --> 00:26:01,596
and my Sharp .50 caliber misfired.

361
00:26:01,847 --> 00:26:04,096
That was back in that trouble
in the forties, remember?

362
00:26:04,221 --> 00:26:05,888
I remember.

363
00:26:06,138 --> 00:26:08,513
You want to taste something
come directly from heaven?

364
00:26:08,638 --> 00:26:09,680
No.

365
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,138
- Where'd you get this?
- That boy's mama baked 'em.

366
00:26:20,805 --> 00:26:22,514
You thinking the same thing I am?

367
00:26:22,638 --> 00:26:26,639
She's a widow woman, Boss,
and she's got a long, hard road to hoe.

368
00:26:26,763 --> 00:26:27,972
Hire her.

369
00:26:32,764 --> 00:26:35,472
I always said you had
a heap of sense.

370
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:38,305
Mr. McLintock,
this is my mother.

371
00:26:40,639 --> 00:26:43,472
- Your mother?
- And my sister.

372
00:26:43,597 --> 00:26:47,806
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. McLintock.
- Ma'am, this here's my boss,

373
00:26:48,014 --> 00:26:51,430
and he has a few choice words
to say about your biscuits.

374
00:26:53,764 --> 00:26:55,472
Yes, Mr. McLintock?

375
00:26:59,014 --> 00:27:00,473
Well... they're great.

376
00:27:13,473 --> 00:27:16,306
Well, you old Cantonese reprobate,
how about it?

377
00:27:16,431 --> 00:27:19,098
You fire me,
l kill myself.

378
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:22,765
I'm not talking about firing you.
I'm retiring you.

379
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,807
You been rustling food
for us for 30 years.

380
00:27:26,265 --> 00:27:28,390
We're going to put you
out to pasture.

381
00:27:28,515 --> 00:27:31,349
All you'll have to do is give advice,
be one of the family.

382
00:27:31,473 --> 00:27:34,723
- l kill myself.
- l may save you the trouble.

383
00:27:34,848 --> 00:27:36,266
Hey, Ching,

384
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:41,807
you kill yourself, I'll cut off your pigtail,
and you ain't never going to get to heaven.

385
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:46,015
- I'll be one of the family?
- l give you my solemn word.

386
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,641
Pretty crummy family...

387
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:51,849
drink too much, get in fight,
yell all time.

388
00:27:53,432 --> 00:27:55,099
Cut off his pigtail.

389
00:27:55,224 --> 00:27:58,016
All right. All right.
I'll be one of the family.

390
00:28:10,044 --> 00:28:13,041
I hope everything is satisfactory?

391
00:28:13,474 --> 00:28:16,933
This is such a big house, it'll take me
a while to get used to things.

392
00:28:17,058 --> 00:28:20,475
Now, please don't hesitate
to tell me if anything is wrong.

393
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,308
No bird's-nest soup?

394
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:27,767
Otherwise, just fine.
Everything nice and fine.

395
00:28:27,891 --> 00:28:29,308
Food's heavenly, ma'am.

396
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:31,475
Best apple pie l ever ate.

397
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,433
Curly's right, ma'am.
Hated to leave that last bite.

398
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:35,809
Shall we celebrate with a drink?

399
00:28:35,934 --> 00:28:38,308
Carlos, come
and help me with the dishes.

400
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:40,059
Alice, you want to help, too?

401
00:28:40,183 --> 00:28:42,558
- Yes, Drago.
- All right. Pitch in.

402
00:28:43,226 --> 00:28:46,184
I'll wash, and you kids can dry.
Is that good?

403
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:49,975
Whoa.

404
00:28:58,892 --> 00:29:03,309
Don't seem possible one woman
could use all them clothes.

405
00:29:03,434 --> 00:29:06,017
You keep a civil tongue
in your unprepossessing face.

406
00:29:06,142 --> 00:29:07,851
- Yes, ma'am.
- And unload my baggage, please.

407
00:29:07,976 --> 00:29:09,184
Yes, ma'am.

408
00:29:09,434 --> 00:29:12,851
By the way, what does that word,
"unprepossessing," mean?

409
00:29:18,434 --> 00:29:21,143
- Mrs. McLintock!
- Oh, hello, Carlos.

410
00:29:21,476 --> 00:29:24,227
Run and help the driver
with my luggage.

411
00:29:24,351 --> 00:29:28,435
l couldn't trust anyone else in this house
to do anything correctly.

412
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,102
- Luggage? Give him a hand, Curly.
- Yes, Boss.

413
00:29:34,435 --> 00:29:36,976
- Mr. McLintock.
- Are you moving back in?

414
00:29:37,102 --> 00:29:40,644
Yes, but nothing has changed
except my place of residence,

415
00:29:41,185 --> 00:29:43,310
and I'd be willing
to put up with savages...

416
00:29:43,435 --> 00:29:45,976
rather than be denied
the company of my daughter,

417
00:29:46,102 --> 00:29:48,811
and I'm proving that
by moving in here.

418
00:29:48,936 --> 00:29:53,268
Mr. McLintock, since it's my first day,
would you excuse me if l, uh...

419
00:29:53,394 --> 00:29:57,186
Go ahead.
Oh, Katherine, this is Dev Warren.

420
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,352
He joined the outfit today.

421
00:29:59,477 --> 00:30:01,811
- Pleased, ma'am.
- Thank you.

422
00:30:04,353 --> 00:30:08,269
Well, how refreshing
a polite young man here.

423
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,977
- Where did he come from?
- He's a farmer.

424
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:13,561
- A farmer?
- Well, I'll be doggone!

425
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,645
Kate, welcome home.

426
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:19,478
What on earth are you doing
in that idiotic-looking outfit?

427
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:22,728
- And don't you dare call me "Kate".
- That's my butling suit.

428
00:30:22,853 --> 00:30:25,395
I'm butling for the boss.
And I'm sorry, Katherine.

429
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,810
That "Kate" kind of slipped out,
from the times l remembered...

430
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,645
you as being nice peop... people.

431
00:30:30,677 --> 00:30:32,235
Oh!

432
00:30:34,853 --> 00:30:38,311
Are you going to stand there
with that stupid look on your face...

433
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:41,104
while the hired help insults your wife?

434
00:30:41,812 --> 00:30:43,354
He's just ignorant.

435
00:30:43,478 --> 00:30:45,686
He doesn't know any better
than to tell the truth.

436
00:30:45,812 --> 00:30:47,812
And I can't help this stupid look.

437
00:30:47,937 --> 00:30:51,686
I started acquiring it as you
gained in social prominence.

438
00:30:51,812 --> 00:30:55,437
Mrs. McLintock, where do
you want I should put...

439
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,020
Put them in the master bedroom.

440
00:31:02,687 --> 00:31:07,145
Yes, but move Mr. McLintock's
things into another room.

441
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,270
Oh, the one back of the stairs
would be best...

442
00:31:09,396 --> 00:31:11,813
so that he can't wake up
the entire household...

443
00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:13,729
when he comes home every night...

444
00:31:13,854 --> 00:31:16,729
...just before daybreak.
- Yes, ma'am.

445
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,105
Oh, excuse me.

446
00:31:22,521 --> 00:31:26,313
- Here's your cigars, Mr. McLintock.
- I am Mrs. McLintock.

447
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,188
Kate... I mean Katherine...

448
00:31:28,313 --> 00:31:30,979
this is the cook, this is the lady
that does the cooking for us.

449
00:31:31,105 --> 00:31:33,563
Mrs. Warren,
Mrs. McLintock.

450
00:31:33,688 --> 00:31:34,896
How do you do.

451
00:31:35,021 --> 00:31:36,979
Very pleased to meet you,
Mrs. McLintock.

452
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:38,814
- Very pleased.
- Likewise.

453
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,929
You see,
I just came to work here today,

454
00:31:40,978 --> 00:31:42,557
and I guess I jumped to the conclusion...

455
00:31:42,688 --> 00:31:45,563
that this was a bachelor's household.

456
00:31:47,396 --> 00:31:50,022
It is, and then again,
it isn't.

457
00:31:50,647 --> 00:31:54,313
I will explain so everything will be
quite clear, Mrs. Wallace...

458
00:31:54,897 --> 00:31:56,396
"Mrs. Warren."

459
00:31:58,647 --> 00:32:00,022
"Mrs. Warren."

460
00:32:00,855 --> 00:32:04,605
It has been a bachelor's
household for quite some time,

461
00:32:05,397 --> 00:32:08,481
and it will be again
just as soon as I'm out of here,

462
00:32:08,606 --> 00:32:10,980
which will be as quickly
as I can make arrangements..

463
00:32:11,105 --> 00:32:13,689
to take my daughter
back east with me.

464
00:32:13,939 --> 00:32:16,939
You see, she's coming home
from school in a few days,

465
00:32:17,064 --> 00:32:20,689
and then we'll be off together,
and you can return to conducting yourself...

466
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:23,314
as you consider proper
in a bachelor's household.

467
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:25,439
- Katie!
- Shut up!

468
00:32:26,147 --> 00:32:28,940
Until then, I am mistress
in this house,

469
00:32:29,731 --> 00:32:31,773
and I will give the orders.

470
00:32:34,731 --> 00:32:35,985
- You gonna let her? Ain't you
gonna say nothing, boss?

471
00:32:36,035 --> 00:32:36,784
No!

472
00:32:36,815 --> 00:32:39,148
I want one poached egg, toast...

473
00:32:39,273 --> 00:32:41,898
Oh, G.W., as soon as
my things are put away,

474
00:32:42,023 --> 00:32:43,773
I want to talk to you
about Rebecca.

475
00:32:43,898 --> 00:32:48,273
Yes, Mrs. McLintock.
Indeed, Mrs. McLintock.

476
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:49,981
Of course, Mrs. McLintock.

477
00:32:50,106 --> 00:32:53,023
The toast... lightly browned
and unbuttered.

478
00:32:54,315 --> 00:32:55,899
Of course, ma'am.

479
00:32:58,148 --> 00:33:00,398
Wait a minute now, Boss, where
do you think you're going?

480
00:33:00,524 --> 00:33:02,398
I just remembered
I got a date.

481
00:33:02,524 --> 00:33:04,315
But she said she want to
have a talk with you.

482
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,732
I heard.

483
00:33:11,815 --> 00:33:14,399
- Good evening, Lem.
- Good evening, Mr. Mac.

484
00:33:17,857 --> 00:33:21,358
Say, Mr. Mac, what does
"unprepossessing" mean?

485
00:33:22,899 --> 00:33:26,525
I was called that once, Lem.
Looked it up in the dictionary.

486
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:29,815
- It's best you don't know what it means.
- Uh-huh. Thank you. Giddyap.

487
00:33:39,273 --> 00:33:42,942
Hey, what am I going to tell her
when she asks where you went?

488
00:33:43,067 --> 00:33:45,316
When in doubt,
tell the truth.

489
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:48,108
She wouldn't expect that
from you anyway.

490
00:33:49,067 --> 00:33:53,441
- Where's Mr. McLintock going?
- There he goes, burning his last bridge.

491
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,775
You see a yellow streak
about a foot wide...

492
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,816
running up and down
his backbone?

493
00:33:57,942 --> 00:33:59,567
On Mr. McLintock?

494
00:33:59,603 --> 00:34:00,103
Uh-huh.

495
00:34:00,234 --> 00:34:03,775
- He ain't afraid of nothing.
- I once thought that.

496
00:34:23,817 --> 00:34:26,276
- Drago?
- Yes, ma'am?

497
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,193
- Was that, uh...
- He took off. Lit out.

498
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:31,525
- I told him I wanted to talk to him.
- Yes, ma'am.

499
00:34:31,651 --> 00:34:33,609
I was standing right over here
when you said it,

500
00:34:33,734 --> 00:34:35,901
and I was standing right on
those front steps...

501
00:34:36,026 --> 00:34:38,193
when he walked up to a horse,
grabbed a hunk of mane,

502
00:34:38,318 --> 00:34:41,068
- stepped up on him, and sunk spur.
- Where did he go?

503
00:34:41,318 --> 00:34:44,151
Last time I saw him, he was
going east, but you know him.

504
00:34:44,276 --> 00:34:47,151
He's liable to go
north, south, or west.

505
00:34:47,276 --> 00:34:48,568
Get me a carriage.

506
00:34:48,693 --> 00:34:50,735
- Yes, ma'am, but...
- But what?

507
00:34:52,902 --> 00:34:56,526
Maybe you shouldn't follow him
into maybe where he's going into.

508
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,985
What does that mean?

509
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,526
I don't know,
but I wish I hadn't-a said it.

510
00:35:01,652 --> 00:35:04,069
- Well, just get the carriage.
- Yes, ma'am.

511
00:35:06,652 --> 00:35:08,944
- What happened?
- Get the barouche.

512
00:35:09,069 --> 00:35:11,902
- Barouche?
- Hitch it up. She wants to go to town.

513
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:14,361
But Mr. McLintock never
said anything to me about it.

514
00:35:14,486 --> 00:35:16,652
Look, young fella, I'm
the ramrod around this place,

515
00:35:17,361 --> 00:35:20,527
the ramrod around this place, and
you better start giving me a "Yes, sir,"

516
00:35:20,653 --> 00:35:23,402
or you're going to get the roof of this house
pulled down on your head.

517
00:35:23,527 --> 00:35:24,819
Yes, sir.

518
00:35:30,444 --> 00:35:32,861
- Hello, Davey.
- Hi, Mr. McLintock.

519
00:35:32,986 --> 00:35:35,277
- New broom, eh?
- Sweeps clean.

520
00:35:37,944 --> 00:35:41,861
- Hello, Bunny. How is everything?
- Oh, fine, fine, Mr. McLintock.

521
00:35:42,778 --> 00:35:44,444
I'll get you next time.

522
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,320
Two more, Elmer.

523
00:35:59,195 --> 00:36:02,570
Well, look who's here.

524
00:36:03,944 --> 00:36:06,904
What'll it be, Mac?
Same as usual?

525
00:36:07,945 --> 00:36:09,195
Ladies.

526
00:36:10,403 --> 00:36:12,403
- Evening, G.W.
- Jake.

527
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:14,403
- Wrong move.
- What?

528
00:36:14,737 --> 00:36:17,403
The chess problem.
Queen's in danger.

529
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:32,385
Whoa. Whoa.

530
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:39,363
I suppose you can do that.

531
00:36:39,904 --> 00:36:42,404
Camille,
you're on your own.

532
00:36:44,821 --> 00:36:46,404
Mrs. McLintock.

533
00:36:51,279 --> 00:36:53,738
I'm Camille...
Camille Reedbottom.

534
00:36:55,155 --> 00:36:57,488
I... I'm, uh, learning
the game of chess.

535
00:36:59,404 --> 00:37:02,529
Thought it would give me
something to pass the time.

536
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:05,322
See, I have nothing
to do all day long.

537
00:37:07,696 --> 00:37:09,905
I... uh... I just remembered something.

538
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:20,864
Katherine! I didn't
hear you come in.

539
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:24,989
Mr. McLintock, I told you
that I wanted to talk to you.

540
00:37:25,113 --> 00:37:26,363
Not now.

541
00:37:26,781 --> 00:37:29,073
Uh, could I get you
a glass of sherry, Katherine?

542
00:37:29,197 --> 00:37:31,739
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Birnbaum. I could use one.

543
00:37:31,864 --> 00:37:35,198
I came into town
behind a runaway team!

544
00:37:35,906 --> 00:37:38,281
Drago never
could handle horses.

545
00:37:38,405 --> 00:37:41,448
It was that young man whose
mother pretends to be your cook!

546
00:37:41,572 --> 00:37:45,281
- Katherine, your wine.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Birnbaum.

547
00:37:54,615 --> 00:37:57,906
Now, Mr. McLintock, we have
an awful lot to talk over.

548
00:37:58,031 --> 00:38:02,448
First thing I learned about Indian fighting
was to wait for daylight.

549
00:38:02,573 --> 00:38:05,406
And what does our conversation
got to do with Indian fighting?

550
00:38:05,531 --> 00:38:09,573
Indian fighting is good experience
for our kind of conversations.

551
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:09,940
Oh!

552
00:38:09,948 --> 00:38:11,740
It'll wait, Katherine.

553
00:38:12,281 --> 00:38:16,490
Evening, Sheriff, Mr. McLintock.
We had quite a ride out here.

554
00:38:16,615 --> 00:38:20,282
- Oh, I finally got that team settled down.
- It's your move.

555
00:38:20,449 --> 00:38:23,740
- No, it's your move. I just canceled it.
- Now, look here.

556
00:38:23,865 --> 00:38:26,574
You're not going to sit here
all night long and play chess...

557
00:38:26,698 --> 00:38:29,032
when the matter of our daughter
remains unsettled.

558
00:38:29,157 --> 00:38:30,782
I am going to
remain here and play chess,

559
00:38:30,907 --> 00:38:32,657
and the matter of our daughter
is settled.

560
00:38:32,783 --> 00:38:35,240
- She stays.
- Oh, such stubbornness!

561
00:38:35,365 --> 00:38:37,532
Katherine, your hair.

562
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:43,074
Oh, it must look a mess
after that awful ride.

563
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:46,908
No, no. It's just that I haven't
seen you in a long time.

564
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,991
It seems to me that the last time I saw you...

565
00:38:50,116 --> 00:38:52,616
that your hair was a little darker, no?

566
00:38:54,606 --> 00:38:58,263
- Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha.
- Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha.

567
00:38:58,408 --> 00:39:01,908
It's a funny thing the tricks
a man's memory will play, uh?

568
00:39:02,366 --> 00:39:06,949
Mr. Birnbaum, I think that you've
completely lost your mind.

569
00:39:07,074 --> 00:39:10,908
- You have done something to your hair.
- I have not!

570
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,898
Ha, ha, ha, ah!

571
00:39:13,366 --> 00:39:15,408
If I had, it would be
none of your business.

572
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:18,867
I'm certainly not going to put myself in the
place of those blondene trollops

573
00:39:18,992 --> 00:39:21,116
that you seem to prefer.

574
00:39:22,034 --> 00:39:23,408
- Take it.
- Oh.

575
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:26,241
- Fill it.
- Oh.

576
00:39:41,075 --> 00:39:42,242
Good morning.

577
00:39:44,284 --> 00:39:48,034
- You fellas still at it all night?
- A McLintock never quits,

578
00:39:48,825 --> 00:39:52,618
but a Birnbaum has to.
Besides, the game is over. You got me.

579
00:39:52,743 --> 00:39:55,576
Oh, no, Mr. Birnbaum.
You still got a good game.

580
00:39:55,701 --> 00:39:57,618
Oh, you play chess?

581
00:39:58,201 --> 00:39:59,868
Please, take over.

582
00:40:04,743 --> 00:40:06,659
- Pretty good?
- Fair.

583
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:11,784
Well, looks like I won't have to come into
town always to get a game.

584
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,160
Remember, I'm a bad loser.

585
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,951
- It's your move.
- Yes, sir.

586
00:40:41,077 --> 00:40:42,535
Good morning.

587
00:40:43,994 --> 00:40:45,410
Good morning.

588
00:40:47,202 --> 00:40:48,994
Is it morning already?

589
00:40:49,015 --> 00:40:49,804
Hmm-mm.

590
00:40:49,911 --> 00:40:51,411
Cup of coffee?

591
00:40:52,827 --> 00:40:54,328
Oh, yes. Thanks, Jake.

592
00:40:56,702 --> 00:40:58,744
You're welcome, Katherine.

593
00:41:00,494 --> 00:41:03,453
- Got any cream?
- Canned cow's milk.

594
00:41:03,786 --> 00:41:05,119
That'll do.

595
00:41:06,786 --> 00:41:08,703
Good old condensed milk.

596
00:41:10,536 --> 00:41:12,244
That reminds me...

597
00:41:12,828 --> 00:41:15,244
I was cleaning out my desk
the other day,

598
00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:18,578
and I found something
I wanted to return to you.

599
00:41:23,162 --> 00:41:24,536
Here it is.

600
00:41:31,995 --> 00:41:34,203
It is a medal, do you remember?

601
00:41:35,203 --> 00:41:38,412
<i>"From the President of the
United States of America..."</i>

602
00:41:38,828 --> 00:41:41,704
<i>"to First Sergeant
Michael Patrick Gilhooly..."</i>

603
00:41:41,995 --> 00:41:45,120
<i>"for bravery above
and beyond the call of duty."</i>

604
00:41:49,662 --> 00:41:51,120
It's your Papa's.

605
00:41:52,245 --> 00:41:55,121
Reminds me of the first time
I ever saw you.

606
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,871
It was over 17 years ago.

607
00:41:58,704 --> 00:42:00,495
You walked into my store...

608
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:03,954
not much bigger than
the bundle you were carrying.

609
00:42:04,662 --> 00:42:08,121
And in the bundle was the most
beautiful baby I ever saw.

610
00:42:08,954 --> 00:42:10,455
And was she hungry!

611
00:42:12,038 --> 00:42:15,121
You walked all the way
from Superstition Creek...

612
00:42:16,163 --> 00:42:19,705
just to trade me that medal
for a case of canned milk.

613
00:42:21,663 --> 00:42:24,455
G.W. was off somewhere, as usual,

614
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,371
fighting Indians.

615
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:31,747
Sheriff! Sheriff Lord!

616
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:34,164
Well, have you
seen the sheriff?

617
00:42:34,288 --> 00:42:36,913
Kind of early
for him. Did you try his house?

618
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:40,455
- Now, why didn't I think of that?
- Looks like Birnbaum's is open.

619
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,080
Maybe somebody
in here knows.

620
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,663
So there you are, Sheriff.

621
00:42:47,497 --> 00:42:50,080
I told you you were headed for trouble.

622
00:42:50,414 --> 00:42:51,456
Trouble?

623
00:42:51,581 --> 00:42:54,997
I want to know by whose authority
you let those Indians stay in town.

624
00:42:55,122 --> 00:42:57,164
Those savages are wards
of the government,

625
00:42:57,289 --> 00:42:58,872
and I am the representative
of that government...

626
00:42:58,997 --> 00:43:02,622
I told Sheriff Lord that he could
put them up down by the clay slide.

627
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:06,122
Because the town's named after
him, he thinks he owns it.

628
00:43:06,247 --> 00:43:08,581
Well, you check the books in
the recorder's office,

629
00:43:08,706 --> 00:43:11,456
and you'll find I do
own a fair piece of it.

630
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,456
Agard, if you knew anything
about Indians,

631
00:43:14,581 --> 00:43:16,873
you'd know that they're doing
their level best...

632
00:43:16,998 --> 00:43:20,414
to put up with our so-called
"benevolent" patronage...

633
00:43:20,539 --> 00:43:23,998
in spite of the nincompoops that
have been put in charge of it.

634
00:43:24,123 --> 00:43:27,873
Those Indians need my permission
to leave the reservation.

635
00:43:27,998 --> 00:43:30,998
Those chiefs have been giving
orders all their lives.

636
00:43:31,123 --> 00:43:32,707
It's pretty hard
for them to understand...

637
00:43:32,831 --> 00:43:36,498
that they have to hold up their hand
like a schoolboy in a classroom.

638
00:43:36,623 --> 00:43:38,457
The law is very clear.

639
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:41,915
I told you you'd get no
satisfaction from these people.

640
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,749
- We'll get the girl back.
- Girl?

641
00:43:44,874 --> 00:43:47,790
The girl the Indians
kidnapped, but don't worry.

642
00:43:48,248 --> 00:43:51,832
I armed the settlers and set them
to rounding up those red devils.

643
00:43:52,124 --> 00:43:53,832
What is this about a "girl"?

644
00:43:53,957 --> 00:43:56,207
Millie Jones... one of
the settler's daughters.

645
00:43:56,332 --> 00:43:58,665
- The Indians kidnapped her.
- That's ridiculous

646
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,249
And you turned loose a lot of
farmers with shotguns?

647
00:44:01,374 --> 00:44:04,999
- I certainly did.
- You're insane. Let's go, Sheriff.

648
00:44:06,707 --> 00:44:09,499
- Mr. Douglas.
- Oh, Mrs. McLintock.

649
00:44:09,624 --> 00:44:12,708
Much as I hate to agree
with G.W. about anything,

650
00:44:12,832 --> 00:44:16,666
you haven't changed a bit.
You're still an hysterical fool.

651
00:44:21,916 --> 00:44:24,249
- Come into town. I got worried.
- What about?

652
00:44:24,374 --> 00:44:28,541
- Thought maybe Katie shot you.
- Not yet, Drago, but it took restraint.

653
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:32,041
Wait a minute. You better take Agard along,

654
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:35,624
not that he'll be much help.
- Drago, help him on the horse.

655
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:42,292
Just a minute.

656
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:48,833
- I'll drive.
- Yes, ma'am.

657
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:52,834
- Agard, what are you doing?
- Snatch him, Agard!

658
00:44:52,958 --> 00:44:54,266
Agard,
this is serious.

659
00:44:54,326 --> 00:44:57,333
Stay with him, Agard.
Stay with him.

660
00:44:58,542 --> 00:45:02,625
Agard, will you stop showing off
and get in this buggy!

661
00:45:03,042 --> 00:45:04,167
Mercy.

662
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:07,667
Mercy.

663
00:45:08,001 --> 00:45:10,168
That horse is a little green.

664
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,632
Let's go.
Ya!

665
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:27,917
Just where
do you think you're going?

666
00:45:28,042 --> 00:45:31,376
Don't use that range boss
tone of voice with me!

667
00:45:40,751 --> 00:45:41,960
Carter!

668
00:45:42,835 --> 00:45:45,002
We're headed
for Mr. Poorboy's mine.

669
00:45:45,668 --> 00:45:47,543
Mount up some riders.

670
00:45:48,376 --> 00:45:50,835
Right, Boss.
You heard the man!

671
00:45:56,043 --> 00:45:59,252
I don't like it, Mr. McLintock.
I don't like it one bit.

672
00:45:59,377 --> 00:46:02,751
- What don't you like?
- They're planning to hang an Indian!

673
00:46:25,128 --> 00:46:27,961
Oh ho, Sheriff very funny.
Where's the whiskey?

674
00:46:27,995 --> 00:46:29,794
Ha ha!

675
00:46:29,794 --> 00:46:31,044
Hold it!

676
00:46:32,336 --> 00:46:35,253
Not so fast,
Mr. Boss of the Whole Country,

677
00:46:35,378 --> 00:46:38,253
unless you want to wear
a big hole in your middle.

678
00:46:38,711 --> 00:46:42,794
How long is G.W. going to let
that cheechako push him around?

679
00:46:42,919 --> 00:46:45,587
That cheechako
has a sawed-off shotgun.

680
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:48,545
How do you know she didn't
wander off someplace,

681
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:50,795
- or meet some fella, or something?
- What are you saying?

682
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,670
That I didn't raise my girl right?

683
00:46:52,795 --> 00:46:54,837
That she'd wander off
all night with some man?

684
00:46:54,962 --> 00:46:57,461
There's a lot of things
I'm not saying to you, mister,

685
00:46:57,587 --> 00:47:00,045
while you got a sawed-off
shotgun in my middle.

686
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:02,753
But how do you know this Indian
had anything to do with it?

687
00:47:02,879 --> 00:47:05,336
She's gone, ain't she?
She's gone!

688
00:47:05,461 --> 00:47:09,004
Pa!
Pa, I'm over here!

689
00:47:09,379 --> 00:47:10,628
Pa!

690
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:16,629
- Been looking for me, Pa?
- Where you been, gal?

691
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:21,878
Young Ben took me for a sunrise ride,
and the horse wandered away.

692
00:47:23,713 --> 00:47:25,962
- You come down off of there!
- But, Pa!

693
00:47:26,087 --> 00:47:29,004
She's telling the truth, Mr. McLintock.
We wasn't doing nothing.

694
00:47:29,129 --> 00:47:30,379
Well, that's not important right now.

695
00:47:30,504 --> 00:47:32,754
The important thing is that
you don't draw that hog-legg,

696
00:47:32,879 --> 00:47:35,254
or this'll be worse than
Dodge City on Saturday night.

697
00:47:35,379 --> 00:47:39,005
You get on back to the wagon!
I'll tend to you later.

698
00:47:39,796 --> 00:47:43,338
- Now for this young whippersnapper!
- Now, no harm has been done,

699
00:47:43,462 --> 00:47:46,462
and Young Ben here is one of the
nicest boys in the territory.

700
00:47:46,588 --> 00:47:48,506
So just put down that shotgun,
and let's forget it.

701
00:47:48,606 --> 00:47:50,505
I'll teach him to fool with my...

702
00:47:51,921 --> 00:47:54,921
Now...
we'll all calm down.

703
00:47:55,046 --> 00:47:57,838
- Boss, he's just a little excited.
- I know, I know.

704
00:47:57,963 --> 00:48:01,547
I'm going to use good judgment.
I haven't lost my temper in 40 years.

705
00:48:01,672 --> 00:48:04,213
But, pilgrim, you caused
a lot of trouble this morning.

706
00:48:04,338 --> 00:48:05,714
Might have got somebody killed.

707
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,748
And somebody ought
to belt you in the mouth!

708
00:48:07,848 --> 00:48:10,745
But I won't.
I won't...

709
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:12,880
The hell I won't!

710
00:48:15,171 --> 00:48:16,669
Oomf!

711
00:48:19,089 --> 00:48:21,214
McLintock rider!

712
00:48:23,402 --> 00:48:25,131
Yee-ha!

713
00:48:29,077 --> 00:48:30,705
Ha haa!

714
00:48:31,797 --> 00:48:33,047
Oh, McLin!

715
00:48:35,089 --> 00:48:37,089
Hey, Buster...
remember me?

716
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,488
Aah!

717
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:47,089
Well, sir... nice party.

718
00:48:56,132 --> 00:48:59,048
- Do you think you ought to?
- I "ought to" what?

719
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:08,048
Why, you big...

720
00:49:11,136 --> 00:49:12,035
Yeeow!

721
00:49:14,832 --> 00:49:16,031
Aaah!

722
00:49:32,424 --> 00:49:34,258
Good morning, good party!
Great party!

723
00:49:34,382 --> 00:49:37,370
Hey! Wait! I want a word with you.
Hey, just a minute! What... what are you...

724
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,240
My glasses!

725
00:49:38,299 --> 00:49:40,549
Hey, now, stop this,
or you'll be sorry!

726
00:49:43,383 --> 00:49:46,674
Oh, for heaven's sake!

727
00:49:50,757 --> 00:49:53,758
- Stay out of this, Jake.
- It's everybody's war!

728
00:49:53,794 --> 00:49:54,754
Aah!

729
00:50:09,739 --> 00:50:11,737
Run, Old Paint!

730
00:50:13,775 --> 00:50:15,773
Where's the whiskey?

731
00:50:26,633 --> 00:50:28,631
Where's the whiskey?

732
00:50:28,681 --> 00:50:30,629
Good fight, good fight!

733
00:50:38,217 --> 00:50:40,384
- Ha, ha, ha!
- Oh, sorry, McLintock.

734
00:50:44,755 --> 00:50:47,217
- Oh ho, McLin!
- Thanks

735
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:56,218
- Ha ha! Very funny!
- Yeah. Very funny.

736
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:03,207
Ohhh!

737
00:51:09,343 --> 00:51:11,968
Gosh, Mr. Douglas,
I'm sorry!

738
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:13,966
Ha! Ha! Ha!

739
00:51:16,427 --> 00:51:19,251
Bon voyage, Drago! Aahhhh!

740
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,511
Are you still down here?

741
00:51:39,422 --> 00:51:41,927
Hey! Horse wandered away, huh?

742
00:51:42,052 --> 00:51:44,052
Honest, Mr. Jones.
Honest...

743
00:51:47,963 --> 00:51:50,927
Oh... get out of my way!

744
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:56,803
- Nice left.
- Thanks!

745
00:51:58,511 --> 00:52:01,594
- I went to college!
- For this, you don't need college!

746
00:52:02,803 --> 00:52:04,845
You're not
getting me down there!

747
00:52:09,233 --> 00:52:10,831
Ohhh!

748
00:52:15,826 --> 00:52:17,824
Owwww!

749
00:52:21,261 --> 00:52:23,928
You beast!
You did this on purpose!

750
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:28,428
Why, McLintock, you big...

751
00:52:28,554 --> 00:52:31,637
Good morning to you, Mrs. McLintock.
Bunny, you big... oaf!

752
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:33,629
Yeeoowie!

753
00:52:36,095 --> 00:52:37,178
Oh, No!

754
00:52:40,804 --> 00:52:44,221
G.W. McLintock, you big...
great big clumsy...

755
00:52:44,637 --> 00:52:47,395
Well, it's pretty
hard to control yourself... Ohhh...

756
00:52:47,512 --> 00:52:49,673
People, people, people!

757
00:52:57,137 --> 00:52:58,429
Oh, McLin!

758
00:52:59,004 --> 00:53:04,555
Oh, McLin, good party! But no whiskey.
We go home.

759
00:53:12,888 --> 00:53:17,138
- You and your friends!
- Well, we at least saved your hat.

760
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:18,136
Oh!

761
00:53:23,638 --> 00:53:25,305
Where is everybody?

762
00:53:26,555 --> 00:53:28,138
Oh, for heaven's sakes!

763
00:53:37,307 --> 00:53:38,536
Whoa! Whoa!

764
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:41,389
Drago, will you never
learn how to handle a team?

765
00:53:41,514 --> 00:53:44,597
Yes, ma'am, I'll sure try.
I'll tell you that, now.

766
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:48,931
- Crummy family!
- You want to lose your pigtail?

767
00:53:49,055 --> 00:53:50,430
I lose face!

768
00:53:50,973 --> 00:53:53,931
- Lousy leathertips!
- You'll lose more than that!

769
00:53:54,305 --> 00:53:55,806
- Kate.
- Yes?

770
00:53:57,139 --> 00:54:00,098
We could be a big help
to one another.

771
00:54:00,347 --> 00:54:02,389
Like what, may I ask?

772
00:54:02,514 --> 00:54:05,514
Well, we could wash the mud
off of each other.

773
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:09,098
We used to have quite good times
doing that sort of thing.

774
00:54:09,973 --> 00:54:14,640
There are a lot of things we used to do.
Good night, Mr. McLintock!

775
00:54:23,306 --> 00:54:26,431
- Any luck?
- What are you talking about?

776
00:54:26,556 --> 00:54:30,431
- I mean divorce! She still want it?
- Yeah.

777
00:54:30,932 --> 00:54:32,181
You know something,
women are funny.

778
00:54:32,306 --> 00:54:35,015
She fought like a wildcat on your side
out there this afternoon.

779
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:37,390
Come home... she slams
the door in your face.

780
00:54:37,515 --> 00:54:38,640
That divorce business...

781
00:54:38,765 --> 00:54:42,473
is that what you get when you pay
a woman not to live with you?

782
00:54:42,598 --> 00:54:43,974
That's about it.

783
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:46,890
Some women I've knowed,
it'd be worth it.

784
00:54:47,474 --> 00:54:49,640
You know, if we had
any moral character,

785
00:54:49,765 --> 00:54:52,516
we wouldn't be standing here,
covered with mud, drinking...

786
00:54:52,641 --> 00:54:55,516
- when we should be washing.
- G.W.

787
00:54:56,766 --> 00:54:57,932
Drago.

788
00:55:02,891 --> 00:55:04,933
Mrs. Warren,
these biscuits... mmmm!

789
00:55:05,683 --> 00:55:07,265
Why, thank you, Drago.

790
00:55:12,016 --> 00:55:14,849
- Good morning, Mrs. Warren.
- Good morning, Mr. McLintock.

791
00:55:14,975 --> 00:55:16,557
Breakfast for the Boss?

792
00:55:16,683 --> 00:55:19,599
If that's the way you want it, Mr. McLintock.

793
00:55:59,934 --> 00:56:04,642
One poached egg, tea,
toast, lightly browned and un...

794
00:56:05,725 --> 00:56:09,476
Why, Mrs. McLintock...
you have a black eye!

795
00:56:09,601 --> 00:56:10,767
I do? Oooh!

796
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:20,351
- Oh! Ohh... and Becky's coming home today.
- And that's not all..

797
00:56:20,685 --> 00:56:23,434
There's a little something
we'd better get settled.

798
00:56:23,455 --> 00:56:23,945
Hmm?

799
00:56:23,976 --> 00:56:27,226
There are no men listening now,
so we can be ourselves.

800
00:56:27,351 --> 00:56:30,476
Oh, sure, I let you get away
with all that guff the other night,...

801
00:56:30,601 --> 00:56:32,393
but now that we're alone...

802
00:56:32,518 --> 00:56:36,476
When I want the opinion of
the hired help, I'll ask for it.

803
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:39,893
You know, you could wind up
with two black eyes.

804
00:56:40,179 --> 00:56:41,178
What?

805
00:56:41,228 --> 00:56:44,477
Oh... I realize you had
to put on that big act.

806
00:56:45,018 --> 00:56:48,310
We always have to, just before
we get ready to forgive them...

807
00:56:48,435 --> 00:56:51,185
generally for something
they haven't done.

808
00:56:51,602 --> 00:56:54,395
But you and I both know, that's just to
keep them from getting the idea

809
00:56:54,515 --> 00:56:57,185
they, uh... run things.

810
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:00,477
- McLintock give you that black eye?
- No!

811
00:57:01,019 --> 00:57:03,811
Nobody gave it to me.
I won it.

812
00:57:11,477 --> 00:57:15,186
- Morning, Davey.
- Morning, Mrs. Beech. Mr. Beech.

813
00:58:11,771 --> 00:58:14,687
- Why, Miss Becky, welcome home!
- Mr. Douglas!

814
00:58:14,687 --> 00:58:15,536
Hi, Dad!

815
00:58:15,586 --> 00:58:18,103
- My boy! Ha ha ha!
- It's good to see you again!

816
00:58:18,479 --> 00:58:19,562
Daddy!

817
00:58:19,938 --> 00:58:21,720
Daddy! Oh!

818
00:58:24,687 --> 00:58:26,354
It's been two long years!

819
00:58:26,479 --> 00:58:29,313
I guess I'm going to have to
stop calling you "tomboy"!

820
00:58:29,437 --> 00:58:31,438
- Becky.
- Mama!

821
00:58:31,562 --> 00:58:35,522
- Oh, Mama! I wasn't sure you'd be here.
- Oh, I've been here a few days.

822
00:58:35,646 --> 00:58:38,854
Oh, Becky, I've bought you three
of the most beautiful dresses!

823
00:58:38,854 --> 00:58:39,513
Becky!

824
00:58:39,563 --> 00:58:40,979
Uncle Drago!
Ohh!

825
00:58:42,396 --> 00:58:44,730
Did you bring your old uncle
a coming-home present?

826
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,563
- Sure did!
- What is it?

827
00:58:46,688 --> 00:58:49,063
A mustache cup!
And what did you get me?

828
00:58:49,188 --> 00:58:52,271
Prettiest palomino pony that
ever packed a saddle.

829
00:58:52,396 --> 00:58:55,104
Broke to stand ground-tied
in the county.

830
00:58:56,897 --> 00:58:58,230
Uncle Jake! Ohh!

831
00:59:00,772 --> 00:59:02,563
What are you doing
with Mr. Douglas' tuba?

832
00:59:02,688 --> 00:59:04,563
Oh, Mr. Douglas has a fat...

833
00:59:04,688 --> 00:59:06,396
had a little accident.

834
00:59:08,772 --> 00:59:11,522
You know, I brought you a whole
shipment of licorice sticks!

835
00:59:11,647 --> 00:59:13,481
But now that I've seen
how much you've grown,

836
00:59:13,605 --> 00:59:16,939
I think we better exchange them for a
couple of bolts of dress goods, huh?

837
00:59:17,064 --> 00:59:20,147
- Thank you!
- Oh, the mayor was going to be here,

838
00:59:20,272 --> 00:59:23,064
but he had to go to the territorial capital
on a horse theft matter.

839
00:59:23,189 --> 00:59:25,314
But I'm going to give his speech.

840
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,606
Oh, and don't worry about the mayor.

841
00:59:30,731 --> 00:59:33,856
I'm sure that he can find
the bill of sale for the horse.

842
00:59:39,356 --> 00:59:43,273
"Ladies and gentlemen,
we are here to welcome the fairest..."

843
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:46,689
What am I doing?

844
00:59:49,564 --> 00:59:51,440
We are here to welcome back...

845
00:59:51,814 --> 00:59:54,898
the prettiest girl
that was ever born in McLintock,

846
00:59:55,023 --> 00:59:57,315
or in any part of the territory.

847
00:59:57,347 --> 00:59:58,646
Now, this...

848
01:00:03,774 --> 01:00:05,357
- Hey, Davey!
- Yeah?

849
01:00:05,482 --> 01:00:07,273
Got something for you!

850
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,899
Yard manager up at the junction...

851
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,732
told me to let them ride,
so I locked them in here.

852
01:00:13,857 --> 01:00:16,315
I've had my scalp
a long time,

853
01:00:17,024 --> 01:00:18,857
and I aim to keep it!

854
01:00:28,846 --> 01:00:31,843
<i>Yatahe.</i>

855
01:00:41,358 --> 01:00:45,191
And now she's come back to us.
Gone are the pigtails....

856
01:00:45,316 --> 01:00:49,775
But the freckles are still on the prettiest face
that was ever born in McLintock.

857
01:01:00,192 --> 01:01:01,524
Hey, that's Puma.

858
01:01:03,691 --> 01:01:06,566
Then it's true. The government
did turn them loose.

859
01:01:06,691 --> 01:01:08,317
Good old Puma.

860
01:01:08,858 --> 01:01:12,525
I'll never forget
when he brought G.W. home.

861
01:01:13,525 --> 01:01:17,609
Your father had a hole
in his chest and a 104 fever.

862
01:01:17,734 --> 01:01:20,359
Of course, they weren't
very mannerly about it.

863
01:01:20,484 --> 01:01:25,317
He came past the house at a high lope
and threw him on the doorstep.

864
01:01:25,859 --> 01:01:29,567
Then you do remember them
good old days, don't you, Katie?

865
01:01:32,484 --> 01:01:33,901
"Katherine."

866
01:01:52,026 --> 01:01:54,859
<i>- Yatahe, my friends.
- Yatahe.</i>

867
01:01:55,109 --> 01:01:57,026
Puma, honored enemy.

868
01:01:58,610 --> 01:02:01,818
Does Big McLintock forget,
also blood brothers?

869
01:02:02,026 --> 01:02:04,109
No, I'll never forget that.

870
01:02:04,234 --> 01:02:06,610
Old wound...
does it hurt still?

871
01:02:06,818 --> 01:02:09,234
I feel it when it comes on to rain.

872
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,735
An inch higher, and I wouldn't
have had to worry.

873
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:14,860
Aw, Big McLintock,
that was remembered fight.

874
01:02:15,943 --> 01:02:19,902
We return with news.
Our people have more trouble.

875
01:02:21,943 --> 01:02:24,735
You see, I learn good English
now, Big McLintock.

876
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:27,235
Learned in white man's jail.

877
01:02:27,361 --> 01:02:30,818
But we would have you talk
our cause at government hearing.

878
01:02:32,611 --> 01:02:36,611
I understand that Governor Humphreys
is going to preside at that meeting.

879
01:02:38,861 --> 01:02:41,402
Yes, Puma,
I'll translate your wishes.

880
01:02:41,527 --> 01:02:43,235
Mr. McLintock, uh...

881
01:02:43,402 --> 01:02:47,111
could I impose upon you to use your
Comanche to tell these chiefs that...

882
01:02:47,235 --> 01:02:51,111
Puma is chief of the Comanches,
and he speaks English very well.

883
01:02:51,307 --> 01:02:52,806
Ah, well...

884
01:02:53,278 --> 01:02:56,403
Your people will have to follow
my instructions to the letter.

885
01:02:56,527 --> 01:02:57,736
- It is the law of the land...
- We go.

886
01:02:59,569 --> 01:03:01,487
Well, now, just a minute...

887
01:03:04,445 --> 01:03:06,278
Well, for heaven's sakes!

888
01:03:23,236 --> 01:03:25,653
You wait here, honey.
I'll get the buggy.

889
01:03:27,278 --> 01:03:29,737
- Are you going to the McLintock party?
- Surely.

890
01:03:29,862 --> 01:03:31,321
Will I see you there, Beth?

891
01:03:31,445 --> 01:03:33,612
Of course, Davey, and you
can have the first dance.

892
01:03:33,737 --> 01:03:34,820
Sis! Come on.

893
01:03:36,528 --> 01:03:39,112
I don't want any sister of mine
talking to strangers.

894
01:03:39,237 --> 01:03:42,071
Davey's not a stranger.
He clerks in Birnbaum's.

895
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:46,862
He's an Indian.

896
01:03:53,946 --> 01:03:55,362
Darn you, Drago!

897
01:03:58,071 --> 01:03:59,946
Now look what you've done.

898
01:04:00,072 --> 01:04:03,197
Baby, this is Devlin Warren.
He works for your papa.

899
01:04:03,321 --> 01:04:05,738
Dev, this is
Miss Becky McLintock.

900
01:04:05,863 --> 01:04:07,321
Those are my things.

901
01:04:07,905 --> 01:04:09,071
Yes, ma'am.

902
01:04:09,197 --> 01:04:11,571
Aw, I'd have known you
anywhere, Miss Becky.

903
01:04:11,696 --> 01:04:13,197
What do you mean?

904
01:04:14,654 --> 01:04:17,696
Oh! I mean, you look so much like
your mother. Well, even prettier!

905
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:21,780
Well, Mr. Warren,
Mother's much prettier than I am.

906
01:04:21,905 --> 01:04:25,155
Many a fight's started with words like that.
Come on, get in the buggy.

907
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,405
Hello, Ching!

908
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:29,781
- We got jelly pie for dinner?
- I'm not cooking!

909
01:04:29,906 --> 01:04:31,322
No, he's not.

910
01:04:31,447 --> 01:04:33,697
- Junior!
- Yes, Miss Becky!

911
01:04:33,822 --> 01:04:37,530
- You remember Junior Douglas, Mama.
- Oh, of course. How's college?

912
01:04:37,655 --> 01:04:40,530
- Valedictorian. 95.
- Oh, congratulations!

913
01:04:40,655 --> 01:04:43,447
Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Douglas,
we will see you at the party, of course?

914
01:04:43,572 --> 01:04:45,156
Oh, delighted!

915
01:04:45,447 --> 01:04:47,984
Well, it'll be pretty hard
to keep young Matt away.

916
01:04:48,014 --> 01:04:48,613
Yes, sir!

917
01:04:48,614 --> 01:04:51,156
- Drago!
- Yes, Boss, baggage all loaded.

918
01:04:51,281 --> 01:04:54,239
G.W.!
You remember young Junior?

919
01:04:55,364 --> 01:04:57,864
Oh, yes.
Like father, like son.

920
01:04:58,323 --> 01:05:01,989
Oh, uh, Mr. McLintock, uh, I hope
you don't think I'm being presumptuous

921
01:05:02,114 --> 01:05:05,072
in asking for the honor
of calling on Miss Rebecca.

922
01:05:06,031 --> 01:05:09,364
- Well, there she is. Ask her yourself.
- Well, thank you, sir!

923
01:05:09,615 --> 01:05:12,239
Ching, now I'm gonna get fired.
Giddyap out of here!

924
01:05:12,364 --> 01:05:14,072
Thank you, sir.
Thank you!

925
01:05:17,364 --> 01:05:20,781
- Have you no manners?
- See you at the party, Junior!

926
01:05:21,032 --> 01:05:23,948
- Yeah. Yeap.
- Yeah what?

927
01:05:24,115 --> 01:05:26,032
Like father,
like son.

928
01:05:28,449 --> 01:05:30,157
What did he mean, Matthew?

929
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:35,990
Come on, Ching,
grab a root and growl.

930
01:05:44,115 --> 01:05:46,616
Well, you're doing
a good job, Miss McLintock.

931
01:05:46,741 --> 01:05:48,282
Thank you, Mrs. Warren.

932
01:05:48,407 --> 01:05:52,490
Dev, when you're finished there,
go over and help Drago with the beer kegs.

933
01:05:52,616 --> 01:05:53,866
Yes, Mom.

934
01:05:56,616 --> 01:05:59,365
Uh, Dev... could you come
and help me a minute?

935
01:06:05,574 --> 01:06:07,991
I certainly was surprised
to hear you went to college.

936
01:06:08,116 --> 01:06:10,325
- Why?
- I don't know.

937
01:06:10,949 --> 01:06:14,824
Junior says Purdue's a good college
for a backwater place like Indiana.

938
01:06:14,949 --> 01:06:16,158
Well, he did, indeed.

939
01:06:16,283 --> 01:06:18,450
Oh, could you do this?
I can't reach it.

940
01:06:20,491 --> 01:06:23,575
- Why didn't you finish college?
- Lack of funds.

941
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:26,325
My father got sick,
and he had to come out west.

942
01:06:26,783 --> 01:06:28,867
So he took out a homestead.

943
01:06:29,575 --> 01:06:34,366
You know, your mom's sure cute.
It's, uh, too bad you didn't inherit her eyes.

944
01:06:39,325 --> 01:06:43,159
Well, you'd been lucky, if you'd inherited
a few things from your father.

945
01:06:43,909 --> 01:06:46,575
Oh, really?
For instance?

946
01:06:47,909 --> 01:06:50,700
- His common sense, for instance.
- Common sense?

947
01:06:50,909 --> 01:06:54,992
Yeah. You don't see him being fooled
by some dude like Junior Douglas.

948
01:06:55,117 --> 01:06:58,367
Junior's not a dude! He's nifty.

949
01:06:59,034 --> 01:07:01,075
This needs a woman's touch.

950
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:05,451
- And besides, he got a letter at college.
- What sport?

951
01:07:05,826 --> 01:07:08,701
- Glee club.
- Very strenuous.

952
01:07:08,737 --> 01:07:11,434
Hmmph! Oooh!

953
01:07:12,074 --> 01:07:14,951
Oh! Don't you dare hug me!

954
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:19,207
I have no intention
of hugging you.

955
01:07:19,247 --> 01:07:20,905
Oooh!

956
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:09,077
Ladies all look
lovely, Katherine.

957
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:11,536
You know, this is a real fine party.

958
01:08:11,661 --> 01:08:15,202
Oh, thank you, Ben. Of course, we had
to invite everybody.

959
01:08:15,828 --> 01:08:17,786
Just everybody.

960
01:08:19,828 --> 01:08:22,036
Sorry, G.W.,
this one's mine.

961
01:08:22,828 --> 01:08:26,703
Well, thank you, Mrs. Warren. I guess I'll have
to be a good host in my own home.

962
01:08:26,828 --> 01:08:29,953
- Well, the next one's yours, Mr. McLintock.
- Thank you.

963
01:08:57,995 --> 01:09:01,120
- Drago, go and do what I told you to do.
- Oh, Katie!

964
01:09:01,245 --> 01:09:03,412
"Katherine!"
And do as you're told!

965
01:09:03,537 --> 01:09:06,537
"Ohh, Drago do this,
Drago do that!"

966
01:09:10,408 --> 01:09:13,038
Yee-ha!
People, people, people!

967
01:09:13,246 --> 01:09:15,704
- This Douglas feller...
- Drago!

968
01:09:16,371 --> 01:09:17,620
Yes, ma'am.

969
01:09:17,746 --> 01:09:19,912
Matt Douglas, junior...

970
01:09:20,079 --> 01:09:24,038
is going to bring you folks some of the
latest terpsichorean dance steps...

971
01:09:24,163 --> 01:09:27,871
brand-new, brought by him
directly from New York City.

972
01:09:30,912 --> 01:09:32,455
All right, Mr. Fiddler.

973
01:10:15,956 --> 01:10:17,497
Give me a whiskey!

974
01:10:19,123 --> 01:10:21,664
- What?
- This turn a ten-gallon party, boss.

975
01:10:21,914 --> 01:10:25,206
- We are run out of whiskey.
- Well, I can take care of that, Ching.

976
01:10:42,998 --> 01:10:44,206
Indian!

977
01:10:48,914 --> 01:10:52,123
And you still got any ideas
about asking my sister to dance,

978
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,457
get up, and we can do this
all over again.

979
01:10:54,582 --> 01:10:55,748
Yes!

980
01:10:55,874 --> 01:10:59,498
- That's enough! You fought it! It's all over!
- Quit butting in, Birnbaum!

981
01:10:59,623 --> 01:11:03,166
- He's a hired man, not your son!
- Look, you fought him fair and square!

982
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:05,707
I don't think
it was so fair and square.

983
01:11:06,707 --> 01:11:08,790
Well, you want to take up
where he left off?

984
01:11:08,915 --> 01:11:11,915
If I did, you wouldn't
find it so easy.

985
01:11:15,790 --> 01:11:17,332
Now, we've had
enough of this!

986
01:11:17,458 --> 01:11:19,291
When are you going
to quit walking away?

987
01:11:19,416 --> 01:11:21,541
Just as soon as we're
out of sight of the party.

988
01:11:21,666 --> 01:11:24,082
"Don't fight in front of women."

989
01:11:24,207 --> 01:11:26,666
- Well, we're out of sight now.
- So we are.

990
01:11:44,083 --> 01:11:48,167
Such vulgarity.
Someone should do something about it.

991
01:11:48,916 --> 01:11:50,333
You're right.

992
01:11:51,624 --> 01:11:53,208
Absolutely right.

993
01:12:23,209 --> 01:12:25,042
You all right, Young Ben?

994
01:12:26,418 --> 01:12:28,459
I'm all right,
Mr. McLintock.

995
01:12:28,625 --> 01:12:31,084
Pretty fancy fighting
for a country boy.

996
01:12:31,543 --> 01:12:35,042
Two years at Purdue, Mr. McLintock,
on the boxing team.

997
01:12:35,501 --> 01:12:38,334
I never thought
any farmer could whip me,

998
01:12:39,585 --> 01:12:41,293
but you sure did.

999
01:12:41,418 --> 01:12:44,376
Better get him cleaned up.
Get him some water, Jake.

1000
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,669
Yeap.

1001
01:13:03,419 --> 01:13:07,377
Well, get yourself cleaned up.
Go ask that girl for a dance.

1002
01:13:07,751 --> 01:13:08,835
Who?

1003
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,085
Oh!

1004
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:16,579
Did I miss one?

1005
01:13:16,669 --> 01:13:19,627
Where is he? I'll find him,
that young whippersnapper!

1006
01:13:19,752 --> 01:13:20,794
Trouble.

1007
01:13:20,919 --> 01:13:22,794
Where is
that farmer boy? Where is he?

1008
01:13:22,919 --> 01:13:24,460
Where is he, G.W.?

1009
01:13:25,752 --> 01:13:29,377
Oh, so you're the young farmer boy,
that whipped my nephew!

1010
01:13:29,627 --> 01:13:32,128
Well, I'm Fauntleroy Sage,
Young Ben's uncle.

1011
01:13:32,252 --> 01:13:34,711
Well, I'm no farmer,
but if you're Young Ben's uncle,

1012
01:13:34,831 --> 01:13:37,544
yes, I whipped him,
and you're intruding.

1013
01:13:37,669 --> 01:13:40,336
- What's "intruding" mean?
- Butting in.

1014
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:42,669
Oh, so he's insulting me!

1015
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:45,044
Well, then I got another
reason for walloping him,

1016
01:13:45,169 --> 01:13:47,711
besides on account of him
thrashing my nephew Young Ben.

1017
01:13:47,836 --> 01:13:51,295
Fauntleroy, you can't get mixed
up in these youngsters' quarrel.

1018
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:52,628
Family honor.

1019
01:13:52,753 --> 01:13:55,211
I can't have it said
a farmer whipped a Sage!

1020
01:13:55,336 --> 01:13:56,961
You're twice his size.

1021
01:13:57,086 --> 01:13:59,753
Don't let that
bother you, Mr. McLintock.

1022
01:13:59,878 --> 01:14:03,712
If Mr. Fauntleroy insists, I'll just have to
teach him the same lesson.

1023
01:14:16,628 --> 01:14:17,753
Say!

1024
01:14:24,254 --> 01:14:25,712
Sorry, young feller.

1025
01:14:28,504 --> 01:14:31,462
Hate to have to do that,
young fella. No hard feelings.

1026
01:14:31,587 --> 01:14:32,796
Not yet.

1027
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:36,629
- Not yet, what?
- I mean, that isn't all.

1028
01:14:36,754 --> 01:14:38,170
Now, wait a minute.

1029
01:14:39,462 --> 01:14:42,462
Fauntleroy, we're gonna
make this a fair fight.

1030
01:14:43,088 --> 01:14:46,671
Course we are. Course we are, G.W.
There'll be none of this.

1031
01:14:47,421 --> 01:14:49,546
I wouldn't do that, G.W.

1032
01:14:49,671 --> 01:14:52,713
- You wouldn't do...
- Nooo, I wouldn't do that!

1033
01:14:52,838 --> 01:14:56,462
And, Dev, I don't want you kicking
Fauntleroy in the knee.

1034
01:14:56,587 --> 01:14:58,504
He didn't do no such thing!

1035
01:14:58,629 --> 01:15:00,754
And none of this nose-twisting.

1036
01:15:02,547 --> 01:15:04,130
He's all yours.

1037
01:15:13,755 --> 01:15:15,588
Where are my glasses?

1038
01:15:15,714 --> 01:15:17,547
You all right, young feller?

1039
01:15:18,255 --> 01:15:22,047
Ouch! I'm all right, if this Indian agent
will stop stepping all over me.

1040
01:15:22,171 --> 01:15:25,296
G.W, you was just funning me,

1041
01:15:25,422 --> 01:15:28,964
but I want you to know that boy
fought me a fair fight.

1042
01:15:29,089 --> 01:15:31,172
Well, I'm glad to hear that, Fauntleroy.

1043
01:15:31,297 --> 01:15:32,714
Where's my uncle?

1044
01:15:33,755 --> 01:15:36,089
Fauntleroy, what have you been doing?

1045
01:15:36,214 --> 01:15:39,381
- I hope my uncle didn't bother anybody.
- No bother.

1046
01:15:39,506 --> 01:15:43,589
I think we'd better join the ladies,
before they get curious. Drago!

1047
01:15:44,047 --> 01:15:46,922
Fauntleroy, let's
line them all up for a do-si-do.

1048
01:15:47,256 --> 01:15:48,381
Jake.

1049
01:15:49,172 --> 01:15:51,715
you think tincture of arnica would help?

1050
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:55,339
Could be.
Used to help you.

1051
01:15:57,423 --> 01:15:59,798
Gentlemen,
to the medicine cabinet.

1052
01:16:19,923 --> 01:16:21,923
- Good morning, Drago.
- Morning, Becky.

1053
01:16:22,048 --> 01:16:23,132
You seen Daddy?

1054
01:16:23,257 --> 01:16:25,590
Took off early this morning with
a scatter gun over his arm.

1055
01:16:25,716 --> 01:16:26,881
Went hunting.

1056
01:16:26,913 --> 01:16:27,872
Oh.

1057
01:16:54,466 --> 01:16:56,799
- Morning, Daddy.
- Good afternoon.

1058
01:16:57,425 --> 01:16:59,550
What gets you out so early?

1059
01:16:59,757 --> 01:17:01,924
It's something I have
to get straight in my mind.

1060
01:17:02,049 --> 01:17:03,133
Yeah?

1061
01:17:04,758 --> 01:17:05,882
What?

1062
01:17:07,044 --> 01:17:08,483
Mama.

1063
01:17:15,508 --> 01:17:18,299
Why did you and Mama
stop living together, Daddy?

1064
01:17:20,341 --> 01:17:22,466
Why did you separate?

1065
01:17:24,092 --> 01:17:26,092
- Aren't you going to answer me?
- Nope.

1066
01:17:27,217 --> 01:17:30,300
- It's sort of my business, I think..
- I don't.

1067
01:17:32,134 --> 01:17:34,800
Is it another woman?
Usually is.

1068
01:17:36,008 --> 01:17:38,592
At your age,
you always know what's usual.

1069
01:17:38,717 --> 01:17:40,217
It's Mrs. Warren!

1070
01:17:41,842 --> 01:17:46,175
Becky, I don't want to start laying the
law down your first day back home,

1071
01:17:46,926 --> 01:17:49,050
but I'll have no more such talk.

1072
01:17:49,175 --> 01:17:52,259
The first time I ever saw
Mrs. Warren was last week.

1073
01:17:52,384 --> 01:17:54,843
She has a job here
at which she's very good,

1074
01:17:55,217 --> 01:17:57,425
and I hope you'll have
the good manners...

1075
01:17:57,551 --> 01:18:00,051
to not pry into
other people's business...

1076
01:18:02,884 --> 01:18:04,676
Your mother's and mine.

1077
01:18:05,551 --> 01:18:07,343
Pretty good shot, Daddy.

1078
01:18:08,301 --> 01:18:10,051
Oh, I can understand your trouble.

1079
01:18:10,176 --> 01:18:13,510
Mama's often so, well,
so petulant.

1080
01:18:14,218 --> 01:18:15,343
Petulant?

1081
01:18:15,717 --> 01:18:18,176
You learned a lot of words
back east, Becky.

1082
01:18:18,301 --> 01:18:20,760
I wished to God they would have
taught you some meanings.

1083
01:18:20,884 --> 01:18:23,426
You were only
about six months old

1084
01:18:23,718 --> 01:18:28,010
when your mother stayed alone with you in a
sod hut under eight foot of snow...

1085
01:18:28,885 --> 01:18:32,635
while I moved the herd 300 miles
south to try and save it.

1086
01:18:32,927 --> 01:18:34,760
Saved about half of it.

1087
01:18:34,885 --> 01:18:39,094
You were a little more than a year old
at the time of the great Comanche raids.

1088
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:43,552
We stood off 500
Plains Indians for nine days.

1089
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:45,844
Petulant, Becky?

1090
01:18:46,802 --> 01:18:48,844
I think you better go on home.

1091
01:18:48,969 --> 01:18:51,094
See that Ching gets those birds.

1092
01:19:06,761 --> 01:19:07,845
Becky!

1093
01:19:09,302 --> 01:19:10,511
Come here.

1094
01:19:19,803 --> 01:19:22,178
There's something I ought to tell you.

1095
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:25,178
Guess now is as good a time as any.

1096
01:19:25,553 --> 01:19:27,837
You're going to have every young buck
west of the Missouri...

1097
01:19:27,967 --> 01:19:30,595
around here trying to marry you.

1098
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:33,387
Mostly because
you're a handsome filly,

1099
01:19:33,512 --> 01:19:37,679
but partly because I own everything in
this country from here to there.

1100
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:42,011
They'll think you're going to inherit it.
Well, you're not.

1101
01:19:42,971 --> 01:19:45,470
I'm going to leave most of it to...

1102
01:19:45,971 --> 01:19:48,845
well, to the nation, really, for a park...

1103
01:19:49,554 --> 01:19:54,470
where no lumbermill will cut down all the
trees for houses with leaky roofs.

1104
01:19:55,263 --> 01:19:58,512
Nobody will kill all the beaver
for hats for dudes...

1105
01:19:59,012 --> 01:20:01,304
nor murder the buffalo for robes.

1106
01:20:02,304 --> 01:20:03,845
What I'm going to give you...

1107
01:20:03,971 --> 01:20:06,845
is a 500-cow spread on the upper Green River.

1108
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:09,845
Now, that may not seem
like much,

1109
01:20:10,429 --> 01:20:13,263
but it's more than we had,
your mother and I.

1110
01:20:14,554 --> 01:20:17,137
Some folks are going
to say I'm doing all this...

1111
01:20:17,721 --> 01:20:22,263
so I can sit up in the hereafter and
look down on a park named after me,

1112
01:20:23,096 --> 01:20:27,513
or that I was disappointed in you,
didn't want you to get all that money.

1113
01:20:28,055 --> 01:20:31,680
But the real reason, Becky,
is because I love you,

1114
01:20:32,264 --> 01:20:36,138
and I want you and some
young man to have what I had,

1115
01:20:36,972 --> 01:20:40,055
because all the gold
in the United States Treasury...

1116
01:20:40,972 --> 01:20:43,180
and all the harp music in heaven...

1117
01:20:43,389 --> 01:20:46,347
can't equal what happens
between a man and a woman...

1118
01:20:46,472 --> 01:20:48,514
with all that growing together.

1119
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:53,930
I can't explain it any better than that.

1120
01:21:01,681 --> 01:21:03,263
All right, Daddy.

1121
01:21:06,222 --> 01:21:07,389
Becky!

1122
01:21:11,889 --> 01:21:15,139
When you're as old as I am,
you'll thank me for this.

1123
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,847
Daddy, I'm full-grown.

1124
01:21:19,681 --> 01:21:21,847
I wasn't worrying about me.

1125
01:21:22,722 --> 01:21:25,098
I was thinking
about you and Mama.

1126
01:21:57,651 --> 01:21:59,150
Oh!

1127
01:22:07,848 --> 01:22:11,265
Well, all three of them fell
right out of the carriage.

1128
01:22:13,096 --> 01:22:17,099
Well, it's getting rather late, Becky.
It's bedtime.

1129
01:22:17,224 --> 01:22:18,474
Oh, Mother,

1130
01:22:19,557 --> 01:22:21,933
he brought this.
He must have intended to use it.

1131
01:22:22,058 --> 01:22:23,766
- Oh, well....
- Sing us a song!

1132
01:22:23,891 --> 01:22:26,516
Well, if you really want me to.
Gosh, I haven't played...

1133
01:22:26,641 --> 01:22:29,308
<i>- You know "Just Right for Me?"
- Sure.</i>

1134
01:22:29,432 --> 01:22:31,141
It's the rage now.

1135
01:22:31,239 --> 01:22:32,138
Oh!

1136
01:22:36,433 --> 01:22:38,642
Dev, what are you doing?

1137
01:22:38,841 --> 01:22:40,640
Oh, I, uh...

1138
01:22:43,350 --> 01:22:45,475
I just thought
I'd get another cigar.

1139
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,892
Well, you've got one in your mouth
and two burning in the tray.

1140
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:51,308
And that move.

1141
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:53,892
The fellas want me
to play all the time.

1142
01:22:55,392 --> 01:23:00,184
<i>You're cuter than
A baby steer</i>

1143
01:23:00,683 --> 01:23:05,309
<i>And softer than
A mouse's ear</i>

1144
01:23:06,142 --> 01:23:10,309
<i>I want the whole wide world to hear</i>

1145
01:23:10,975 --> 01:23:14,809
<i>You're just right for me</i>

1146
01:23:16,145 --> 01:23:18,802
<i>You're sweeter than...</i>

1147
01:23:18,892 --> 01:23:21,809
Oh, no, not that rhythm, Junior.
Do it the way they do it at the Plaza.

1148
01:23:21,934 --> 01:23:24,934
- I know the words.
- Sure, Becky. Will you sing with me?

1149
01:23:25,059 --> 01:23:26,559
- Of course.
- Alright.

1150
01:23:32,643 --> 01:23:37,143
<i>I love a man who's witty and smart,
And clever</i>

1151
01:23:37,434 --> 01:23:38,893
It's your move.

1152
01:23:38,923 --> 01:23:40,391
Oh.

1153
01:23:40,421 --> 01:23:42,389
<i>My heart forever</i>

1154
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:45,268
Oh, Dev, you're playing
like an amateur.

1155
01:23:45,851 --> 01:23:50,018
Let's call it an evening.
I'd like to know where your mind is tonight.

1156
01:23:53,009 --> 01:23:55,007
<i>You're sweeter than the early stars...</i>

1157
01:23:55,007 --> 01:23:57,635
<i>Or bluebells when they start to...</i>

1158
01:23:57,851 --> 01:24:00,893
Pretty good,
voice like her father.

1159
01:24:04,888 --> 01:24:06,886
<i>You're just right for me</i>

1160
01:24:08,185 --> 01:24:11,936
<i>Sweeter than honey,
Finer than wine</i>

1161
01:24:12,185 --> 01:24:16,644
<i>I'm sure they found you,
On that honeysuckle vine</i>

1162
01:24:17,136 --> 01:24:20,632
<i>I would melt
In your embrace</i>

1163
01:24:21,132 --> 01:24:24,129
<i>You'd disappear
Without a trace</i>

1164
01:24:24,894 --> 01:24:29,144
<i>To die like this
Is no disgrace</i>

1165
01:24:29,353 --> 01:24:34,977
<i>This is the time,
This is the place, For you're</i>

1166
01:24:36,436 --> 01:24:38,520
<i>Just right for me!</i>

1167
01:24:45,058 --> 01:24:48,895
Well, it's so good, I kind of
hate to break this up,

1168
01:24:49,353 --> 01:24:52,228
but we're going to have
that Indian hearing tomorrow morning...

1169
01:24:52,353 --> 01:24:55,103
Sir, about our conversation
earlier this evening,

1170
01:24:55,229 --> 01:24:58,103
- I believe I'd better apologize.
- Yeah?

1171
01:24:58,478 --> 01:25:01,728
Yes, sir, I've been thinking it over,
and when I called you a "reactionary",

1172
01:25:01,853 --> 01:25:06,354
well, that's merely my generation's
term for your generation.

1173
01:25:06,853 --> 01:25:09,312
- Nothing personal, you understand.
- Oh, really?

1174
01:25:11,853 --> 01:25:13,437
Well, good night, sir.

1175
01:25:14,062 --> 01:25:17,312
- Good night, Mrs. McLintock.
- Good night, and do come again.

1176
01:25:18,395 --> 01:25:20,229
- Good night, Drago.
- Good night.

1177
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:27,187
Boss... what does "reactionary" mean?

1178
01:25:27,646 --> 01:25:29,021
Me, I guess.

1179
01:25:29,604 --> 01:25:33,146
He says that anyone that wanted to sell
at a profit was a "reactionary".

1180
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:36,271
Was we "reactionaries" back in them days
when you was selling beef cattle...

1181
01:25:36,395 --> 01:25:38,386
for six cents a pound on the hoof?

1182
01:25:38,436 --> 01:25:41,979
Well, no use arguing with him.
College boy.

1183
01:25:56,979 --> 01:25:59,021
Devlin Warren,
if you was my kind of man,

1184
01:25:59,146 --> 01:26:02,188
you wouldn't let some dude walk off with
the prettiest girl west of Denver...

1185
01:26:02,313 --> 01:26:04,647
- without putting up some kind of fight.
- Does it show?

1186
01:26:04,772 --> 01:26:07,772
What can I do? I'm just one of
her father's employees.

1187
01:26:07,897 --> 01:26:09,688
I'm just a hired hand
around here.

1188
01:26:09,813 --> 01:26:11,647
Every so often, Dev...

1189
01:26:12,313 --> 01:26:14,980
you spill the strangest ideas.

1190
01:26:16,438 --> 01:26:18,397
Everybody works for somebody.

1191
01:26:18,521 --> 01:26:21,272
Me, I work for everybody
in these United States...

1192
01:26:21,397 --> 01:26:24,147
that steps into a butcher's
shop for a T-bone steak,

1193
01:26:24,272 --> 01:26:27,314
and you work for me.
There's not much difference.

1194
01:26:28,855 --> 01:26:32,064
Daddy, the most terrible
thing just happened!

1195
01:26:32,189 --> 01:26:35,481
Junior's horse ran away,
the one he rented at the livery stable.

1196
01:26:35,606 --> 01:26:39,064
You tied up a rented horse by the reins?
He's probably back in the stall by now.

1197
01:26:39,189 --> 01:26:42,439
I think we can get Junior
something that he can ride.

1198
01:26:42,564 --> 01:26:46,065
What I'd rather do, Daddy,
is drive Junior home in our barouche.

1199
01:26:46,189 --> 01:26:49,856
It's a lovely evening, and I'm sure
Uncle Drago wouldn't mind driving.

1200
01:26:49,981 --> 01:26:53,273
I would, and I got the kind of manners
don't keep me from saying so...

1201
01:26:53,397 --> 01:26:54,606
just to be polite.

1202
01:26:54,731 --> 01:26:56,731
I'll drive him home,
Mr. McLintock,

1203
01:26:56,856 --> 01:27:00,148
and you don't have to come, Miss Becky.
I'll see that he gets home safely.

1204
01:27:00,273 --> 01:27:03,773
- I can take care of myself.
- You got yourself a foot, didn't you?

1205
01:27:03,898 --> 01:27:07,315
- Dev, get the carriage. Drago.
- I'm going with them.

1206
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,814
Now you got me
wrangling dudes.

1207
01:27:24,190 --> 01:27:28,565
<i>You make a man
feel like a king</i>

1208
01:27:28,899 --> 01:27:31,815
<i>You're just right for me</i>

1209
01:27:32,523 --> 01:27:35,441
Miss Becky, somebody better
help me watch the road.

1210
01:27:35,565 --> 01:27:39,066
You know, I'm new around here.
Might take the wrong turnoff.

1211
01:27:39,191 --> 01:27:43,316
Devlin Warren, you know there isn't
a turnoff between here, and town.

1212
01:27:43,441 --> 01:27:47,358
<i>You disappear
without a trace</i>

1213
01:27:47,483 --> 01:27:51,608
<i>To die like this
Is no disgrace</i>

1214
01:27:51,733 --> 01:27:56,483
<i>- This is the time
- This is the place</i>

1215
01:27:56,512 --> 01:27:58,480
Yah! Yah!

1216
01:27:59,650 --> 01:28:02,399
Devlin Warren, what are
you trying to do, kill us?

1217
01:28:02,524 --> 01:28:05,108
Would you rather
have your friend drive?

1218
01:28:05,134 --> 01:28:06,502
Yah!

1219
01:28:06,802 --> 01:28:07,801
Oh!

1220
01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:10,498
Oh!

1221
01:28:20,108 --> 01:28:21,733
Daddy! Daddy!

1222
01:28:21,858 --> 01:28:24,525
I have never been
so humiliated in my entire life!

1223
01:28:24,651 --> 01:28:27,609
I said what I said, and I'll
stand by it to the death.

1224
01:28:27,983 --> 01:28:30,567
Shoot him, Daddy.
Shoot him at once.

1225
01:28:31,317 --> 01:28:34,359
- Well, why?
- My honor is at stake.

1226
01:28:34,650 --> 01:28:37,852
- Well, now, your honor
- Absolutely. He impugned my honor.

1227
01:28:38,022 --> 01:28:40,442
- "Impugned?"
What does that mean?

1228
01:28:40,817 --> 01:28:44,068
- Slander! He slandered my honor!
- He did?

1229
01:28:44,193 --> 01:28:46,942
I said what I said, and I'll
stand by it to the death.

1230
01:28:47,068 --> 01:28:49,068
He admits it! See?
Shoot him!

1231
01:28:49,193 --> 01:28:52,318
- Well, what is he admitting to?
- Why, he called me a...

1232
01:28:52,485 --> 01:28:53,942
I won't even repeat the word.

1233
01:28:54,068 --> 01:28:55,901
I didn't necessarily
call you anything,

1234
01:28:56,026 --> 01:28:58,692
but I said what I said, and I'll
stand by it to the death.

1235
01:28:58,817 --> 01:29:01,776
Well, just for the tally books,
what did you say?

1236
01:29:01,901 --> 01:29:04,276
I said that "any girl who would
permit a man to kiss her...

1237
01:29:04,401 --> 01:29:06,984
"before they're formally engaged
is a trollop."

1238
01:29:07,109 --> 01:29:08,984
He said it again! Shoot him!

1239
01:29:09,109 --> 01:29:11,443
- Now, hold on.
- No, don't hold on!

1240
01:29:11,568 --> 01:29:14,735
If you're my father, if you
love me, you'll shoot him.

1241
01:29:14,876 --> 01:29:18,693
Well, I'm your father, and I sure love you...

1242
01:29:18,818 --> 01:29:19,985
so...

1243
01:29:21,943 --> 01:29:25,027
Oh, you shot him!
You really shot him!

1244
01:29:25,152 --> 01:29:26,402
- Hey!
- If he dies...

1245
01:29:26,526 --> 01:29:29,943
If he dies, he'll be the first man ever
killed with a blank cartridge.

1246
01:29:30,069 --> 01:29:32,777
We use this to start
the races on the Fourth.

1247
01:29:33,228 --> 01:29:35,611
Hey, I'm on fire!

1248
01:29:35,735 --> 01:29:38,694
- Oh, you poor dear!
- Poor dear!

1249
01:29:38,818 --> 01:29:42,277
- You'd have had me shot in cold blood!
- But it didn't happen.

1250
01:29:42,402 --> 01:29:45,444
Yelling I insulted you, and all!
What you need is a good spanking!

1251
01:29:45,569 --> 01:29:47,069
Oh, Dev! Daddy!

1252
01:29:47,486 --> 01:29:49,152
Leave me out of this!

1253
01:29:49,819 --> 01:29:52,944
- Oh, I think I'll give you what you deserve.
- You wouldn't dare!

1254
01:29:53,070 --> 01:29:54,152
Oh, wouldn't I?

1255
01:29:54,277 --> 01:29:56,944
You'll think next time
before you have someone shot!

1256
01:29:57,070 --> 01:29:58,944
This kicking and yelling
isn't going to help!

1257
01:29:59,070 --> 01:30:01,070
Don't! Daddy, wait
a second! Daddy!

1258
01:30:02,659 --> 01:30:03,658
Ow!

1259
01:30:03,944 --> 01:30:07,028
Daddy, help me! Don't!

1260
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:11,320
Devlin Warren, I hate you!
I hate you!

1261
01:30:11,819 --> 01:30:14,445
Mommy! Mommy!

1262
01:30:14,468 --> 01:30:15,247
Oh!

1263
01:30:15,278 --> 01:30:17,111
G.W, was that a shot?

1264
01:30:20,102 --> 01:30:22,100
Ohh!

1265
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:27,779
- Becky, what happened?
- He spanked me!

1266
01:30:29,945 --> 01:30:32,153
You spanked my daughter?

1267
01:30:32,528 --> 01:30:33,612
Dev.

1268
01:30:35,403 --> 01:30:39,154
You mean you stood there while
that brute beat our daughter?

1269
01:30:39,445 --> 01:30:41,279
G.W, what's happened to you
in the last three years?

1270
01:30:41,403 --> 01:30:42,528
Better part of valor, son.

1271
01:30:42,653 --> 01:30:45,237
Isn't it enough that you've always
treated me like a squaw...

1272
01:30:45,362 --> 01:30:48,612
without subjecting dear, sweet Becky
to this crude, vulgar...

1273
01:30:48,737 --> 01:30:51,654
Katherine, you women are always
raising hell about one thing...

1274
01:30:51,779 --> 01:30:54,362
when it's something else
you're really sore about.

1275
01:30:54,488 --> 01:30:56,446
Don't you think it's
about time you told me...

1276
01:30:56,571 --> 01:30:59,446
what put the burr
under your saddle about me?

1277
01:30:59,571 --> 01:31:03,196
I don't intend to stand here
and hold a midnight conversation...

1278
01:31:03,321 --> 01:31:05,446
with an intoxicated man.

1279
01:31:14,446 --> 01:31:17,030
And I am not intoxicated...

1280
01:31:20,905 --> 01:31:21,988
Yet!

1281
01:31:29,155 --> 01:31:31,614
- Hello, Governor!
- Hello, Governor!

1282
01:31:51,363 --> 01:31:53,822
- Chief Puma.
- Yes, Sergeant.

1283
01:31:54,655 --> 01:31:58,572
Big McLintock, we know
you'll get us fair judgment.

1284
01:31:59,072 --> 01:32:01,031
You gentlemen, follow me.

1285
01:32:06,156 --> 01:32:08,989
- Well, Jake?
- G.W.

1286
01:32:15,489 --> 01:32:19,989
- Well, G.W., it's been a long time.
- Not long enough... Cuthbert.

1287
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:26,448
- Your husband is a rude man.
- Yes, Cuthbert, I know.

1288
01:32:39,865 --> 01:32:42,115
Where you want the Indians,
Mr. McLintock?

1289
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:44,948
Mr. McLintock is not
running this hearing.

1290
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:48,198
- Sergeant, seat those Indians.
- Yes, sir.

1291
01:32:48,324 --> 01:32:49,948
Gentlemen, be seated.

1292
01:32:51,990 --> 01:32:54,782
Their whole tribe here
wanted to come into town.

1293
01:32:54,908 --> 01:32:56,407
Proceed, Lieutenant.

1294
01:32:58,574 --> 01:33:00,282
This hearing is now in session,

1295
01:33:00,407 --> 01:33:02,699
Governor Cuthbert Humphreys
presiding.

1296
01:33:02,824 --> 01:33:04,282
Good luck, Daddy.

1297
01:33:04,490 --> 01:33:06,657
I'm afraid
it's a packed court.

1298
01:33:06,782 --> 01:33:08,616
Government edict number 826.

1299
01:33:09,407 --> 01:33:11,949
"As ordered that the Comanche
nation be transferred..."

1300
01:33:12,074 --> 01:33:14,782
"from their present reservation
to Fort Sill,"

1301
01:33:14,908 --> 01:33:18,657
"it is the government's claim as
filed by Indian agent Agard..."

1302
01:33:20,366 --> 01:33:24,450
"that these chiefs, after being released
from prison by a kindly government..."

1303
01:33:24,575 --> 01:33:28,949
"did then rouse and incite defiance
among the tribe against said order."

1304
01:33:30,491 --> 01:33:34,116
It seems, gentlemen, that although some
of these chiefs speak English...

1305
01:33:34,241 --> 01:33:37,033
Chief Puma is quite at home
in our language...

1306
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:40,700
they have chosen Mr. McLintock
to be their spokesman.

1307
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:45,575
I speak for the Comanche,
or rather I offer this translation.

1308
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:48,075
Proceed, Mr. McLintock.

1309
01:33:55,492 --> 01:33:57,200
The Comanches says...

1310
01:33:58,117 --> 01:34:01,117
<i>"We are an old people,
and a proud people.</i>

1311
01:34:01,618 --> 01:34:03,576
<i>"When the White Man
first came among us,</i>

1312
01:34:03,701 --> 01:34:06,701
<i>"we were as many as
the grasses of the prairie.</i>

1313
01:34:07,618 --> 01:34:10,909
<i>"Now we are few,
but we are still proud.</i>

1314
01:34:11,659 --> 01:34:15,117
<i>"For if a man lose his pride
and manhood, he is nothing.</i>

1315
01:34:15,868 --> 01:34:18,784
<i>"You tell us now that if we will
let you send us away...</i>

1316
01:34:18,909 --> 01:34:21,367
<i>"to this place called Fort Sill,</i>

1317
01:34:21,492 --> 01:34:23,993
<i>"you will feed us
and care for us.</i>

1318
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:26,451
<i>"Let us tell you this:</i>

1319
01:34:26,909 --> 01:34:29,576
<i>"It is a Comanche law
that no chief ever eats...</i>

1320
01:34:29,701 --> 01:34:32,826
<i>"unless first he sees that
the pots are full of meat...</i>

1321
01:34:32,951 --> 01:34:35,576
<i>"in the lodges of
the widows and orphans.</i>

1322
01:34:35,701 --> 01:34:37,951
<i>"It is the Comanche way of life.</i>

1323
01:34:38,993 --> 01:34:44,035
<i>"This that the White Man calls 'charity'
is a fine thing for widows and orphans,</i>

1324
01:34:44,785 --> 01:34:49,118
<i>"but no warrior can accept it,
for if he does, he is no longer a man...</i>

1325
01:34:49,243 --> 01:34:52,035
<i>"and when he is no longer a man,
he is nothing...</i>

1326
01:34:52,452 --> 01:34:53,952
<i>"and better off dead.</i>

1327
01:34:54,076 --> 01:34:58,660
<i>"You say to the Comanche: 'You are widows
and orphans. You are not men.'</i>

1328
01:34:58,869 --> 01:35:01,827
<i>"And we the Comanches say:
'we would rather be dead'.</i>

1329
01:35:01,952 --> 01:35:05,036
<i>"It will not be a remembered
fight when you kill us,</i>

1330
01:35:05,161 --> 01:35:08,202
<i>"because we are few now,
and have few weapons,</i>

1331
01:35:08,702 --> 01:35:12,369
<i>"but we will fight,
and we will die Comanche."</i>

1332
01:35:16,578 --> 01:35:18,536
Thank you, Big McLintock.

1333
01:35:19,077 --> 01:35:23,453
Am I to gather the Comanche defy
the government of the United States?

1334
01:35:23,578 --> 01:35:28,119
Yes, you may gather that the Comanche
defy the United States government...

1335
01:35:28,327 --> 01:35:30,870
- or at least this commission.
- Gentlemen.

1336
01:35:39,911 --> 01:35:43,162
It is the order of this court, that these chiefs
be incarcerated until such time...

1337
01:35:43,287 --> 01:35:46,037
as the detachment
of United States cavalry...

1338
01:35:46,162 --> 01:35:47,619
be made avaible...

1339
01:35:47,745 --> 01:35:50,828
to escort them
and the Comanche nation to Fort Sill.

1340
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:54,786
This court is adjourned.

1341
01:35:58,370 --> 01:35:59,746
McLintock,

1342
01:35:59,870 --> 01:36:02,537
you are important chief amongst these white people.

1343
01:36:02,662 --> 01:36:04,037
Sway them.

1344
01:36:04,162 --> 01:36:07,620
Have them give us few guns
to make the fight worthwhile.

1345
01:36:07,871 --> 01:36:11,454
Let us have one last remembered
fight for end of Comanche.

1346
01:36:11,912 --> 01:36:14,746
I almost wish
I could arrange that, Puma.

1347
01:36:14,777 --> 01:36:18,733
Aha loni cha!

1348
01:36:21,662 --> 01:36:23,495
- Sergent.
- Yes?

1349
01:36:23,620 --> 01:36:25,704
Left, right, carry on.

1350
01:36:25,954 --> 01:36:27,121
Gentlemen!

1351
01:36:36,204 --> 01:36:38,204
It's sad, these changing times.

1352
01:36:39,329 --> 01:36:42,079
It isn't the times
that are changing, Mama.

1353
01:37:06,830 --> 01:37:08,122
Hi, G.W.

1354
01:37:08,247 --> 01:37:09,622
Hello, Lem.

1355
01:37:25,497 --> 01:37:26,622
Bunny.

1356
01:37:28,289 --> 01:37:29,831
Oh, howdy, McLintock.

1357
01:37:30,873 --> 01:37:33,123
Figured you'd be
belly-down drunk by now.

1358
01:37:33,248 --> 01:37:36,165
I've been doing some
thinking drinking, Bunny.

1359
01:37:36,706 --> 01:37:38,831
Is that boxcar still on the siding?

1360
01:37:38,956 --> 01:37:40,956
- Well, sure, but...
- But what?

1361
01:37:41,123 --> 01:37:43,290
- I don't like it.
- You don't, eh?

1362
01:37:43,415 --> 01:37:45,039
You figure if
them Indians get out of there...

1363
01:37:45,165 --> 01:37:47,123
and lead the cavalry
on a wild goose chase,

1364
01:37:47,248 --> 01:37:48,582
that Great White Father's
going to get nosy.

1365
01:37:48,706 --> 01:37:50,914
Get nosy,
and he'll investigate,

1366
01:37:51,039 --> 01:37:53,623
and when they find out,
how that sidesaddle governor's...

1367
01:37:53,748 --> 01:37:55,373
been messing things up,

1368
01:37:55,498 --> 01:37:57,498
they'll give those Indians
a fair trial.

1369
01:37:57,623 --> 01:37:59,623
That's live ammunition
in that boxcar.

1370
01:37:59,748 --> 01:38:02,623
You know what will happen, if them Indians
get some guns in their hands?

1371
01:38:02,748 --> 01:38:04,040
Somebody is going to get hurt.

1372
01:38:04,165 --> 01:38:06,790
- Is Puma's word good enough for you?
- Well, I don't...

1373
01:38:08,331 --> 01:38:10,248
McLintock, you got yourself a partner.

1374
01:38:10,373 --> 01:38:11,874
Leave me out of this.

1375
01:38:12,373 --> 01:38:13,456
Hey, McLintock...

1376
01:38:16,665 --> 01:38:18,249
Ha ha ha.
Good night, Bunny.

1377
01:38:20,748 --> 01:38:22,499
Good night, Governor.

1378
01:38:23,891 --> 01:38:25,859
Governor!

1379
01:38:26,374 --> 01:38:27,907
<i>Where is the Katie</i>

1380
01:38:28,457 --> 01:38:32,957
<i>With her light red hair?</i>

1381
01:38:34,332 --> 01:38:36,791
<i>Sweet as the roses</i>

1382
01:38:36,916 --> 01:38:39,791
<i>On the summer air</i>

1383
01:38:40,082 --> 01:38:42,791
<i>I'll find her somewhere</i>

1384
01:38:42,916 --> 01:38:46,708
<i>While the moon is high</i>

1385
01:38:46,833 --> 01:38:50,125
<i>And tell her
that I love her</i>

1386
01:38:50,374 --> 01:38:53,958
<i>And I'll love her till I die</i>

1387
01:38:54,083 --> 01:38:55,125
Katie!

1388
01:38:55,958 --> 01:39:00,458
Katherine Gilhooly McLintock!
The master's home!

1389
01:39:01,455 --> 01:39:04,452
Katie!
Katie!

1390
01:39:05,333 --> 01:39:08,417
"Katherine Gilhooly McLintock."

1391
01:39:08,875 --> 01:39:10,875
Where's the woman of the house?

1392
01:39:11,417 --> 01:39:12,750
Uh, Mr. McLintock.

1393
01:39:14,041 --> 01:39:15,500
Oh, there you...

1394
01:39:16,458 --> 01:39:19,750
Mrs. Warren!
Oh, good evening.

1395
01:39:20,542 --> 01:39:23,750
- I waited up for you, Mr. McLintock.
- Oh, how nice.

1396
01:39:24,417 --> 01:39:27,417
- I want to talk to you about something.
- Delighted, delighted.

1397
01:39:28,584 --> 01:39:32,417
- 309 times straight.
- I beg your pardon?

1398
01:39:32,542 --> 01:39:36,917
309 times straight, without a miss.
Got to be a record.

1399
01:39:37,251 --> 01:39:39,917
I suppose so. Now,
Mr. McLintock, what I wanted to say...

1400
01:39:40,042 --> 01:39:42,875
Two-pound Stetson with
6-inch brim,

1401
01:39:43,001 --> 01:39:46,334
53 feet in the air,
It's got to be a record.

1402
01:39:46,501 --> 01:39:48,834
I'm sure it is,
but the reason I waited...

1403
01:39:48,959 --> 01:39:52,251
Dagnammit, woman,
can't you hold that glass still?

1404
01:39:52,376 --> 01:39:53,751
Of course, sir.

1405
01:39:53,784 --> 01:39:54,803
Now...

1406
01:39:55,459 --> 01:39:58,167
Down the hatch
to my world's record.

1407
01:40:00,585 --> 01:40:02,085
Down the hatch!

1408
01:40:02,918 --> 01:40:04,168
Yes, sir.

1409
01:40:10,543 --> 01:40:13,918
And now...
to the governor of our territory.

1410
01:40:14,918 --> 01:40:17,043
T-t-the governor
of the territory, sir?

1411
01:40:17,168 --> 01:40:19,960
Now, don't you stick up for him,
Mrs. Warren.

1412
01:40:20,085 --> 01:40:21,960
You're a fine woman,
Mrs. Warren,

1413
01:40:22,085 --> 01:40:24,711
but you'll certainly go down
in my estimation...

1414
01:40:24,835 --> 01:40:28,794
if you stick up for Cuthbert H. Humphreys,
governor of this territory.

1415
01:40:29,085 --> 01:40:31,836
- I don't mean to change the...
- Down the hatch.

1416
01:40:32,627 --> 01:40:34,919
Aw... yes sir.
Down the hatch.

1417
01:40:38,294 --> 01:40:41,877
Cuthbert H. Humphreys, governor
of our territory,

1418
01:40:42,086 --> 01:40:43,961
is a cull.

1419
01:40:44,086 --> 01:40:46,044
Do you know
what a "cull" is, ma'am?

1420
01:40:47,211 --> 01:40:50,669
A "cull" is a specimen
that is so worthless...

1421
01:40:50,961 --> 01:40:52,877
that you have to cut him
out of the herd.

1422
01:40:53,003 --> 01:40:56,627
Now, if all the people in the
world were put in one herd,

1423
01:40:57,128 --> 01:40:59,794
Cuthbert is the one
I would throw my rope at.

1424
01:41:00,086 --> 01:41:03,086
At whom, at whom I would throw
my rope at.

1425
01:41:04,044 --> 01:41:05,837
Natural born "cull".

1426
01:41:06,211 --> 01:41:09,503
- Another touch, ma'am?
- Oh, no, sir, no.

1427
01:41:13,962 --> 01:41:16,420
- Well, I, I don't mind if I do.
- Good.

1428
01:41:16,795 --> 01:41:18,294
You can't walk on one leg.

1429
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:22,254
Oh, I didn't mean to be vulgar, ma'am.
Can't walk on one limb.

1430
01:41:22,461 --> 01:41:23,753
It's all right.

1431
01:41:24,545 --> 01:41:27,379
Sounds silly.
Only a bird can walk on a limb.

1432
01:41:28,212 --> 01:41:30,504
You know my wife?
Her name's "Katie".

1433
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:33,753
She insists on being called "Katherine".
Do you know her?

1434
01:41:33,878 --> 01:41:36,587
Of course, Mr. McLintock, and
that's what I wanted to talk...

1435
01:41:36,712 --> 01:41:40,170
Well, she thinks that Cuthbert H. Humphreys...

1436
01:41:40,295 --> 01:41:44,295
is panting for her like a bull buffalo
at the first green-up of spring.

1437
01:41:45,045 --> 01:41:48,170
But what Cuthbert is panting for
is my money.

1438
01:41:50,087 --> 01:41:52,879
Don't make me feel
like I'm drinking alone, ma'am.

1439
01:41:53,046 --> 01:41:56,421
Very well, Mr. McLintock,
if you insist.

1440
01:41:57,504 --> 01:42:00,379
- Down the hatch!
- Good!

1441
01:42:13,713 --> 01:42:15,171
Mr. McLintock...

1442
01:42:16,463 --> 01:42:19,338
I have something very important
to say to you.

1443
01:42:21,213 --> 01:42:22,630
Very important.

1444
01:42:25,213 --> 01:42:27,839
Guess it'll have to wait
till the morning.

1445
01:42:28,714 --> 01:42:29,839
Toodles.

1446
01:42:29,862 --> 01:42:30,871
Oh!

1447
01:42:31,171 --> 01:42:32,880
No, it's all right.
It's all right.

1448
01:42:34,422 --> 01:42:35,880
Beddy bye-bye.

1449
01:42:43,369 --> 01:42:45,367
Whoops... Oh!

1450
01:42:46,423 --> 01:42:50,214
Mrs. Warren,
Let me assist you.

1451
01:42:50,797 --> 01:42:52,256
Very kind.

1452
01:43:04,238 --> 01:43:06,236
Ooop... ooop... oop!

1453
01:43:07,235 --> 01:43:09,233
Aaah!

1454
01:43:13,229 --> 01:43:14,728
Whoops!

1455
01:43:16,423 --> 01:43:18,257
What's going on here?

1456
01:43:18,756 --> 01:43:22,132
Now, Katherine, are you going
to believe what you see...

1457
01:43:22,257 --> 01:43:24,173
or what I tell you?

1458
01:43:24,209 --> 01:43:25,218
Oh!

1459
01:43:28,048 --> 01:43:31,632
Uh, Mrs. McLintock,
hope you won't misunderstand.

1460
01:43:32,215 --> 01:43:35,715
It's the first hundred women sitting
on his lap that I misunderstood.

1461
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:38,424
Number 101 is quite simple.

1462
01:43:38,549 --> 01:43:40,632
Now, G.W. McLintock,
I have something...

1463
01:43:42,799 --> 01:43:44,549
He's gone to sleep.

1464
01:43:45,423 --> 01:43:48,549
Just when I know exactly what I
want to say to him,

1465
01:43:48,674 --> 01:43:50,423
he goes to sleep.

1466
01:43:52,174 --> 01:43:55,757
I waited up
to talk to Mr. McLintock.

1467
01:43:57,133 --> 01:43:59,258
I wanted to tell him
I was quitting.

1468
01:43:59,383 --> 01:44:03,550
You see, Sheriff Lord has asked
me to marry him, and...

1469
01:44:04,757 --> 01:44:06,383
Oh, oh, congratulations!

1470
01:44:07,174 --> 01:44:11,174
I don't want to seem prudish, but if you
are going to marry Sheriff Lord,

1471
01:44:11,299 --> 01:44:14,633
it seems to me that you're
sitting on the wrong man's lap.

1472
01:44:16,628 --> 01:44:17,627
Oh!

1473
01:44:19,007 --> 01:44:20,800
Come on, I'll help you upstairs,

1474
01:44:20,925 --> 01:44:23,800
and we'll have a long talk
about men in general.

1475
01:44:26,466 --> 01:44:27,637
Ladies...

1476
01:44:28,636 --> 01:44:30,334
One moment!

1477
01:44:41,425 --> 01:44:44,008
Watch out!
You'll get us all killed!

1478
01:44:44,031 --> 01:44:45,160
Whoops!

1479
01:44:51,342 --> 01:44:54,008
Wait a minute, ladies,
till I catch my breath,

1480
01:44:54,133 --> 01:44:56,551
then I'll get you
up those stairs,

1481
01:44:56,676 --> 01:45:01,551
as sure as my name is
"George Washington McLintoooock".

1482
01:45:15,301 --> 01:45:17,843
- You may be quitting, Mrs. Wallace...
- Mrs. Warren.

1483
01:45:17,968 --> 01:45:19,218
But not tomorrow.

1484
01:45:19,343 --> 01:45:21,843
I want my breakfast in bed.
I want...

1485
01:45:21,968 --> 01:45:24,176
I know.
Toast, lightly browned...

1486
01:45:24,301 --> 01:45:26,884
Somebody sure put a knob
on my skull.

1487
01:45:27,468 --> 01:45:30,635
- It was Katie.
- Katie? Why?

1488
01:45:31,426 --> 01:45:33,593
Mrs. Warren was there...

1489
01:45:33,623 --> 01:45:34,702
Ooh...

1490
01:45:34,802 --> 01:45:38,593
And there you was, there,
and there the whiskey bottle was, there.

1491
01:45:38,718 --> 01:45:42,343
And Katie's temper being what Katie's
temper is, well... there you are.

1492
01:45:42,802 --> 01:45:44,510
Drago, old friend,

1493
01:45:45,301 --> 01:45:47,261
my wife does not understand me.

1494
01:45:47,385 --> 01:45:49,510
Why should she be
any different than any other?

1495
01:45:49,635 --> 01:45:51,510
Come on,
l got to get you up the stairs.

1496
01:45:51,635 --> 01:45:54,302
Get you ready for
that big celebration tomorrow.

1497
01:45:54,333 --> 01:45:55,302
Watch it!

1498
01:45:55,332 --> 01:45:56,421
Oh!

1499
01:46:01,594 --> 01:46:05,553
Drago...
I am sleeping in the den.

1500
01:46:22,725 --> 01:46:24,024
Hooligans!

1501
01:46:24,178 --> 01:46:26,427
Ain't got no respect
for your elders.

1502
01:46:29,418 --> 01:46:32,416
Bunny lost his temper!

1503
01:46:32,515 --> 01:46:38,410
Bunny lost his temper!
Bunny lost his temper!

1504
01:46:38,970 --> 01:46:42,720
Scallywags! Little imps!
I hope you get the measles!

1505
01:46:48,095 --> 01:46:49,804
Come on,
get him aboard.

1506
01:46:50,011 --> 01:46:51,387
Is everybody ready?

1507
01:46:51,762 --> 01:46:54,303
Uh, number five
needs a flank cinch.

1508
01:46:54,428 --> 01:46:55,762
Get him one.

1509
01:46:57,887 --> 01:46:59,720
Let us know when you're ready.

1510
01:46:59,971 --> 01:47:02,887
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1511
01:47:03,221 --> 01:47:06,346
<i>It is my honor to present to you...</i>

1512
01:47:06,679 --> 01:47:09,470
<i>the governor of our territory,</i>

1513
01:47:10,054 --> 01:47:13,179
<i>Cuthbert H. Humphrey.</i>

1514
01:47:13,887 --> 01:47:15,471
<i>Thank you, Mayor.</i>

1515
01:47:17,429 --> 01:47:21,554
My friends and citizens of this
great territory,

1516
01:47:21,971 --> 01:47:24,513
this is the ninth
consecutive year...

1517
01:47:25,096 --> 01:47:28,763
it has been my privilege
and my pleasure...

1518
01:47:28,888 --> 01:47:33,096
to inaugurate the McLintock
Fourth of July celebration.

1519
01:47:34,055 --> 01:47:37,013
Now, the first event will be
the wild horse race.

1520
01:47:37,846 --> 01:47:41,222
But before I fire the shot to
start the event,

1521
01:47:41,721 --> 01:47:44,596
I would like to say
a few modest words...

1522
01:47:44,888 --> 01:47:49,305
regarding my stewardship
of this great territory.

1523
01:48:24,766 --> 01:48:27,763
Ride it, Ben!
Crush him! Crush him!

1524
01:48:30,361 --> 01:48:31,959
Whoo-hoo!

1525
01:48:35,764 --> 01:48:38,682
- All right, Professor Birnbaum.
- Gentlemen.

1526
01:48:41,972 --> 01:48:43,348
Sheriff, here's your horse.

1527
01:48:43,473 --> 01:48:45,640
Come on, get them all lined up.
Come here, Ching.

1528
01:48:45,765 --> 01:48:48,181
Now, boys,
you all know the rules.

1529
01:48:48,306 --> 01:48:51,057
It's twice around the inside
and once around the outside.

1530
01:48:51,181 --> 01:48:55,264
First cowboy that hits that finish line
without busting that egg is a winner.

1531
01:48:55,390 --> 01:48:58,140
And I caution you boys about
some of them eggs,

1532
01:48:58,265 --> 01:49:01,349
'cause some of them eggs
are last year's holdovers.

1533
01:49:04,973 --> 01:49:06,681
All right, mount up.

1534
01:49:29,682 --> 01:49:32,599
Katherine, my dear, you
seem to be enjoying yourself.

1535
01:49:32,724 --> 01:49:34,974
Oh, yes.
This is wonderful.

1536
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:37,849
It's is the only thing l really do enjoy
about this barbaric country:

1537
01:49:37,974 --> 01:49:39,933
the Fourth of July celebration.

1538
01:49:42,516 --> 01:49:45,641
Well, Katherine, I've been here for three days.
I haven't heard from you.

1539
01:49:45,766 --> 01:49:47,433
- Is anything wrong?
- Wrong?

1540
01:49:47,724 --> 01:49:51,849
Well, I just hope that it hasn't been
necessary for you to say anything...

1541
01:49:52,058 --> 01:49:53,475
...to G.W.

1542
01:49:55,308 --> 01:49:57,475
What are you talking about?

1543
01:49:58,934 --> 01:50:02,642
Well, Katherine, you see, I'm
in a rather delicate position,

1544
01:50:02,767 --> 01:50:04,850
being governor of the territory
and all.

1545
01:50:04,975 --> 01:50:08,892
I just hope you haven't found it necessary
to say anything about...

1546
01:50:09,184 --> 01:50:10,558
About... what?

1547
01:50:11,558 --> 01:50:13,267
About you and me.

1548
01:50:19,934 --> 01:50:23,476
Why, you pompous windbag.

1549
01:50:24,226 --> 01:50:28,017
Do you think that you're the only man,
who's ever tried to play pattyfingers with me?

1550
01:50:28,142 --> 01:50:30,226
Who's ever tried
to lure me into the moonlight?

1551
01:50:30,351 --> 01:50:31,476
Well, no, but I...

1552
01:50:31,601 --> 01:50:34,267
Well, I'm a big girl,
and I can take care of myself.

1553
01:50:34,392 --> 01:50:35,851
My husband knows it.

1554
01:50:35,975 --> 01:50:39,935
I can assure you, Governor, that
your reputation is untarnished.

1555
01:50:40,059 --> 01:50:42,518
Now get out of my way.

1556
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:07,976
Folks, we got ourselves a winner.
Curly Fletcher!

1557
01:51:08,519 --> 01:51:10,143
Mazel tov, Curly!

1558
01:51:12,185 --> 01:51:13,560
Give me the egg.

1559
01:51:16,227 --> 01:51:17,811
Disqualified!

1560
01:51:20,435 --> 01:51:22,185
Here you go, Curly.

1561
01:51:24,393 --> 01:51:26,894
G.W, G.W, you'll never believe
what happened over there.

1562
01:51:27,019 --> 01:51:28,102
What?

1563
01:51:28,435 --> 01:51:32,353
- You smell of beer.
- Well, naturally, I'm drinking beer.

1564
01:51:33,353 --> 01:51:35,019
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1565
01:51:35,478 --> 01:51:37,936
<i>the next event
will be a contest...</i>

1566
01:51:38,144 --> 01:51:42,810
<i>between the two bronco-busting
champions of ....</i>

1567
01:51:42,936 --> 01:51:44,394
<i>our territory</i>

1568
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:46,810
You remember the year
I rode in that event?

1569
01:51:46,936 --> 01:51:49,603
Wore your garters
to hold up my sleeves?

1570
01:51:49,627 --> 01:51:50,056
Shhh!

1571
01:51:50,102 --> 01:51:52,311
We had a bet, and I won it.

1572
01:51:53,645 --> 01:51:57,353
George Washington McLintock,
you are a very crude man.

1573
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:02,103
Well, I guess so, but that was a rough horse,
like to jarred my insides loose.

1574
01:52:02,228 --> 01:52:03,853
But it was worth it.

1575
01:52:03,893 --> 01:52:04,822
Oh!

1576
01:52:07,978 --> 01:52:09,853
Free beers!

1577
01:52:37,229 --> 01:52:41,146
One... two... three...
Go!

1578
01:53:03,145 --> 01:53:05,143
Pull him, Dev
Pull him! Pull him!

1579
01:53:15,855 --> 01:53:18,438
- Dev, Dev, are you all right?
- I guess so.

1580
01:53:18,563 --> 01:53:20,688
Nothing busted but my pride.

1581
01:53:20,813 --> 01:53:23,022
Well, that ought to
even things up, farmer.

1582
01:53:23,147 --> 01:53:24,189
For what?

1583
01:53:24,314 --> 01:53:26,813
For that sore nose you gave me
the other day.

1584
01:53:26,939 --> 01:53:29,397
Well, that ain't
what's sore on him.

1585
01:53:47,522 --> 01:53:51,189
<i>The closing event
is the cow pony race..</i>

1586
01:53:51,397 --> 01:53:54,481
<i>The finish line
is at the barbecue.</i>

1587
01:53:54,606 --> 01:53:56,981
So, start meandering.

1588
01:53:57,856 --> 01:53:59,065
Come on!

1589
01:54:00,648 --> 01:54:03,522
Now, what is that?
False courage?

1590
01:54:04,814 --> 01:54:08,564
Why, you know a Douglas doesn't
ever use a thing like that.

1591
01:54:08,689 --> 01:54:12,565
I want you to get on that horse, get out
in front and stay out in front.

1592
01:54:12,856 --> 01:54:14,731
I'll be out in front, Dad,

1593
01:54:14,856 --> 01:54:17,814
- all the way.
- Aw, good boy.

1594
01:54:18,440 --> 01:54:22,273
Now, remember, stay out in front.
That Agamemnon's a good horse.

1595
01:54:26,857 --> 01:54:28,231
Whoah, Agamemnon.

1596
01:54:33,357 --> 01:54:35,940
11:40, and she's on time.

1597
01:54:48,423 --> 01:54:50,920
Whoah, boy! Dad!

1598
01:54:58,066 --> 01:54:59,483
Whoah!

1599
01:56:04,059 --> 01:56:05,657
Oh, McLin...

1600
01:56:06,193 --> 01:56:09,151
Big party.
Where's your whiskey?

1601
01:56:11,568 --> 01:56:15,318
- Whose idea was this stunt?
- Duck, doggone it, them are real bullets.

1602
01:56:56,194 --> 01:56:57,986
Reckon that's about
all the excitement you'd want...

1603
01:56:58,110 --> 01:56:59,486
for one Fourth of July, eh?

1604
01:56:59,611 --> 01:57:00,986
Old Puma finally got his way.

1605
01:57:01,110 --> 01:57:03,152
But I reckon he's riding out
his last war party.

1606
01:57:03,277 --> 01:57:05,028
Well, he won't get very far.

1607
01:57:05,153 --> 01:57:08,694
But one thing still has me puzzled.
Where did they get the guns?

1608
01:57:08,861 --> 01:57:11,028
I was wondering the same thing.

1609
01:57:12,444 --> 01:57:15,236
- My kidney's been bothering me...
- Bunny...

1610
01:57:16,527 --> 01:57:17,652
G.W.! Psst! Pssst!

1611
01:57:22,528 --> 01:57:24,278
What an idiotic joke!

1612
01:57:24,403 --> 01:57:27,028
- Joke! Do you think that was a joke?
- Well, shut up!

1613
01:57:27,153 --> 01:57:29,278
Do you want everybody in town
to see me?

1614
01:57:29,403 --> 01:57:30,778
You look good in feathers.

1615
01:57:30,815 --> 01:57:31,774
Oh!

1616
01:57:35,236 --> 01:57:38,487
- Dev, I think they've gone.
- Yeah!

1617
01:57:38,737 --> 01:57:40,320
What are you
going to do about it?

1618
01:57:40,445 --> 01:57:42,320
- What can I do?
- Nothing!

1619
01:57:42,695 --> 01:57:44,778
Just like you've always done!

1620
01:57:45,770 --> 01:57:46,769
Oh!

1621
01:57:56,279 --> 01:57:57,778
How long, G.W.?

1622
01:57:58,488 --> 01:58:00,070
- How long, what?
- Katherine.

1623
01:58:00,196 --> 01:58:03,070
She's been riding herd
on you for two years now.

1624
01:58:03,196 --> 01:58:04,487
I'm a peaceable man,

1625
01:58:04,613 --> 01:58:06,859
<i>"You raise your voice,"</i>

1626
01:58:06,899 --> 01:58:08,358
<i>"it doesn't do any good,"</i>

1627
01:58:08,487 --> 01:58:09,987
<i>"it's time to raise your hand."</i>

1628
01:58:10,112 --> 01:58:12,863
Well, I've been planning to do
something about it. I'll, uh...

1629
01:58:13,696 --> 01:58:16,362
- I'll have another talk with her.
- Talk to her?

1630
01:58:17,154 --> 01:58:19,988
Talk to her!
Talking won't do any good.

1631
01:58:23,279 --> 01:58:25,155
Becky, have you seen your m...

1632
01:58:25,571 --> 01:58:27,988
What's been happening
around here?

1633
01:58:29,030 --> 01:58:31,155
You've got hay all over you.

1634
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:35,572
Been some mighty sneaky goings-on here
during that raid, Mr. McLintock.

1635
01:58:36,863 --> 01:58:39,821
Who was it said only a trollop would kiss
a man before...

1636
01:58:39,946 --> 01:58:41,488
they were formally engaged?

1637
01:58:41,614 --> 01:58:43,655
- Oh, but we are engaged, sir.
- You are?

1638
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:45,655
That is, with your permission.

1639
01:58:46,530 --> 01:58:49,572
Well, you've got it.
Oh, Mrs. Warren?

1640
01:58:50,530 --> 01:58:52,530
I think it's wonderful.

1641
01:58:54,280 --> 01:58:58,739
I guess this is the only engagement,
that ever started off of a spanking.

1642
01:59:02,864 --> 01:59:04,906
Mm-hmm,
I reckon Birnbaum was right.

1643
01:59:08,447 --> 01:59:09,739
All right.

1644
01:59:12,239 --> 01:59:15,406
Lord bless us,
this is gonna be a great day.

1645
01:59:15,531 --> 01:59:16,864
Doggone it, folks,

1646
01:59:16,989 --> 01:59:21,323
let's don't let a little old Indian raid
break up a good barbecue and a rodeo.

1647
01:59:22,822 --> 01:59:25,114
- The meat's on!
- Let's go!

1648
01:59:25,573 --> 01:59:28,656
You contestants get ready
for the cow pony race.

1649
01:59:30,628 --> 01:59:33,046
"Shave and a Haircut, two bits"

1650
01:59:33,197 --> 01:59:35,615
- Who is it?
- It's me. Let me in.

1651
01:59:36,698 --> 01:59:37,823
Not now.

1652
01:59:37,981 --> 01:59:39,907
Right now!

1653
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:42,740
- Are you insane?
- I want to talk to you.

1654
01:59:43,531 --> 01:59:45,157
It'll have to wait.

1655
01:59:46,865 --> 01:59:47,948
Oh, G.W.!

1656
01:59:48,073 --> 01:59:50,948
- I've taken all I'm going to take from you.
- You are insane.

1657
01:59:51,073 --> 01:59:53,198
You are going to tell me why you
packed up, picked up,

1658
01:59:53,324 --> 01:59:54,823
and walked out on me.

1659
01:59:54,948 --> 01:59:57,823
Two years ago... you remember...
you came home from Denver...

1660
01:59:57,948 --> 01:59:59,782
with lipstick all over your...

1661
01:59:59,819 --> 02:00:01,078
Aaah!

1662
02:00:05,532 --> 02:00:07,657
Lipstick on my collar.

1663
02:00:11,033 --> 02:00:13,824
- I've got the shirt to prove it.
- Who cares!

1664
02:00:14,657 --> 02:00:16,407
Why, you big...

1665
02:00:16,903 --> 02:00:17,902
Ah!

1666
02:00:35,782 --> 02:00:37,158
Katherine!

1667
02:00:37,153 --> 02:00:38,392
Ah!

1668
02:00:41,533 --> 02:00:43,908
G.W., you are a ruffian.

1669
02:00:44,491 --> 02:00:46,700
Cuthbert, you are right.

1670
02:00:55,950 --> 02:00:58,450
Well, what kind of a family
is that?

1671
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:01,491
The best!

1672
02:01:01,783 --> 02:01:03,367
And dangerous, fella.

1673
02:01:06,035 --> 02:01:08,658
Well, what happened?
Who won the race?

1674
02:01:09,284 --> 02:01:12,200
Who cares, Agard?
History's being made.

1675
02:01:31,409 --> 02:01:32,492
Yes, Rufus?

1676
02:01:32,617 --> 02:01:36,076
I regret to inform you I've changed
my mind about matrimony.

1677
02:01:37,868 --> 02:01:39,451
Rufus!

1678
02:01:57,315 --> 02:01:59,452
Hey! Mrs. McLintock!

1679
02:02:11,431 --> 02:02:12,430
Kath...

1680
02:02:13,577 --> 02:02:14,952
Katherine!

1681
02:02:15,244 --> 02:02:18,827
- Keep them out of here.
- Everybody out!

1682
02:02:43,494 --> 02:02:45,953
Looks like G.W.'s buying out
the whole store.

1683
02:02:46,078 --> 02:02:48,120
I'm afraid you're right.

1684
02:02:54,703 --> 02:02:57,120
Crummy family! Crummy family!

1685
02:03:11,537 --> 02:03:12,704
G.W!

1686
02:03:19,787 --> 02:03:21,996
Oh, G.W, G.W!

1687
02:03:22,033 --> 02:03:25,989
Oh, oh, G.W, G.W!

1688
02:03:27,038 --> 02:03:29,266
Aah!

1689
02:03:35,954 --> 02:03:39,580
Oh, Mrs. McLintock, you're all wet!
- Am I? Try it!

1690
02:03:48,871 --> 02:03:50,496
Wrong woman, G.W.

1691
02:03:51,329 --> 02:03:52,705
Oh, pardon me.

1692
02:04:11,788 --> 02:04:14,621
Mrs. McLintock,
you setting a new style?

1693
02:04:14,661 --> 02:04:16,130
Uh!

1694
02:04:23,123 --> 02:04:24,782
Shhh!

1695
02:04:34,330 --> 02:04:37,539
Mr. McLintock! In here!

1696
02:05:00,707 --> 02:05:05,081
If I ever get through this humiliation,
you will rue the day you ever met me!

1697
02:05:05,206 --> 02:05:07,998
Oh, bellyache and fight all you want.
It won't do you any good.

1698
02:05:08,123 --> 02:05:10,999
You've been digging those burrs
into me for two years.

1699
02:05:11,123 --> 02:05:13,790
Now, you're going to get
your comeuppance.

1700
02:05:14,164 --> 02:05:15,248
Thanks.

1701
02:05:17,540 --> 02:05:19,999
My father would be proud of you!

1702
02:05:20,498 --> 02:05:22,415
Then I'll make him prouder.

1703
02:05:27,832 --> 02:05:29,082
Stop it!
Aah!

1704
02:05:32,623 --> 02:05:34,957
Keep it.
You may need it.

1705
02:05:35,207 --> 02:05:37,082
Now get your divorce.

1706
02:05:37,111 --> 02:05:38,080
Oh!

1707
02:05:38,110 --> 02:05:40,078
Oooh!

1708
02:05:40,374 --> 02:05:43,291
- Home! Don't spare the horse.
- Home? Are you...

1709
02:05:43,416 --> 02:05:44,499
You heard me.

1710
02:05:44,624 --> 02:05:47,374
Don't think you're going
to get rid of me that easy.

1711
02:05:47,411 --> 02:05:48,540
Yah!

1712
02:06:11,333 --> 02:06:13,708
- No more living in the capital?
- No.

1713
02:06:13,833 --> 02:06:16,584
- No more Newport in season?
- Nope.

1714
02:06:16,833 --> 02:06:19,709
No more dancing
at the Governor's Ball?

1715
02:06:19,833 --> 02:06:21,166
No, G.W.

1716
02:06:21,292 --> 02:06:22,750
Happy days!

1717
02:06:25,041 --> 02:06:28,292
310 times,
without a miss.

1718
02:06:29,583 --> 02:06:31,125
That's a record.
