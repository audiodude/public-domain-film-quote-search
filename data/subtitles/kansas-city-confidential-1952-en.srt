innocent until proven guilty

1036
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,867

advise me to answer

1040
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,976
i tell you not to
answer at all unless

1041
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,680
you could answer honestly

1042
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,680
it might incriminate you

1043
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,400
now you're giving
me some good advice

a little problem yeah

01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:40,976
used to happen
pretty often when you

were younger i always knew when

1195

for the movies

1201
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,976
that time you got
into your first form

1202
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,533
when your boat came
down with the mises

one finally had to take

you out myself that night

1205
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:11,976

1384
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:38,976
