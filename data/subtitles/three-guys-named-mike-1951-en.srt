- Already?

00:01:29,642 --> 00:01:29,642
- You wouldn't want Marcy to
miss the train, would you?

7
00:01:30,636 --> 00:01:30,636
- Yeah, I would.

8
00:01:31,654 --> 00:01:31,654
Wouldn't mind it a bit.

00:01:33,598 --> 00:01:33,598

Get your feet out of the way.

- Yeah, he wanted to come
down to the train, dad,

37

00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:06,626
- Oh, and before I forget,
we've got a credit

00:03:09,644 --> 00:03:09,644
If you go down there,
Mother, ask for Marty.

- Marty?

74
00:03:11,593 --> 00:03:11,593
He must be new.

75
00:03:11,643 --> 00:03:11,643
- Yeah.

76
00:03:14,597 --> 00:03:14,597
And I was thinking, Daddy,
when you buy your new suit,

77
00:03:15,619 --> 00:03:15,619
ask him to show you
some pinstripes.

78
00:03:16,626 --> 00:03:16,626
I think they'd look good on you.

- Oh, you do?

00:03:17,626 --> 00:03:17,626
- Mm-hm.

81
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:18,666
And guess where I put
your pipe cleaners?

82
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:19,616
- Where?

83
00:03:20,654 --> 00:03:20,654
- In your top desk drawer.

84
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:24,591
- Well, it'll be nice having
them where they belong.

85
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:27,667
- Well, now you two take care
of yourself while I'm away.

00:03:28,617 --> 00:03:28,617
- Ah-

- We'll be all right.

88
00:03:30,584 --> 00:03:30,584
- Be all right.

89
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:30,671
- Guess that's it.

90
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:32,612
- Well, we'd better set out.

91
00:03:33,586 --> 00:03:33,586
The taxi's waiting.

92
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:33,671
- Well, what's the hurry?

93
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:37,591
The taxi can wait.

94
00:03:40,613 --> 00:03:40,613
Oh, we're going to
miss you, honey.

95
00:03:42,603 --> 00:03:42,603
- I'm going to miss you, too.

96
00:03:43,574 --> 00:03:43,574
I might be back.

97
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:44,591
Maybe they'll turn me down.

98
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:47,641
- No, they won't, but let
me give you some advice.

99
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:49,664
Don't give them a million
suggestions your first day.

100
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:53,608
You know, don't take
over all at once.

101
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:56,600
They've probably been getting
along fine up until now.

102
00:03:57,652 --> 00:03:57,652
And when you go in
for your interview,

103
00:04:01,640 --> 00:05:01,640
- I had a friend who was one.

104
00:04:01,667 --> 00:05:01,675
Will you remember that?

105
00:04:02,658 --> 00:04:10,117
- Yes, sir.

106
00:04:10,152 --> 00:04:17,576
- How do you do?

107
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:18,589
- I'm Marcy Lewis.

108
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:19,620
- Sit down, Miss Lewis.

109
00:04:21,605 --> 00:04:21,605
- Thank you very much, Mr. Wells.

110
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:27,629
- I thought you wrote a
very impressive letter.

111
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:32,606
So you're from
Havenville, Indiana?

112
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:35,598
- Yes, sir.

113
00:04:36,655 --> 00:04:36,655
- Do you like it there?

114
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:37,645
- Yes, sir.

115
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:41,631
- Where did you go to school?

116
00:04:43,643 --> 00:04:43,643
- Havenville.

117
00:04:46,585 --> 00:04:46,585
- Oh.

118
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Um, tell me about your parents.

119
00:04:50,576 --> 00:04:50,576
- They're living.

120
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:55,659
- Tell me, um, what
made you decide

121
00:04:58,572 --> 00:04:58,572
to become an airline stewardess?

122
00:05:01,591 --> 00:06:01,591
It's- it's a home in the air.

123
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:03,605
- I see.

124
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:03,640
- She-

125
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:05,652
- Yes?

126
00:05:06,617 --> 00:05:06,617
- She likes it.

127
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:18,580
- You know, Miss
Lewis, sometimes girls

128
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:19,661
who are very well
adapted to other things

129
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:22,640
aren't quite suited
to this kind of work.

130
00:05:24,622 --> 00:05:24,622
Oh, it's no reflection
on the individual.

131
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:28,627
95% of our applicants
are rejected.

132
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:31,597
- You mean I'm not accepted?

133
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:32,581
- I'm afraid not.

134
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:36,610
- Yes, sir.

135
00:05:40,609 --> 00:05:40,609
- You see, we're
looking primarily

136
00:05:43,628 --> 00:05:43,628
for girls who like to meet
people and take care of them.

137
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:46,569
A stewardess is the greatest
salesman an airline can have.

138
00:05:47,576 --> 00:05:47,576
We've got to be very particular.

139
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:49,607
- But you're absolutely
right, Mr. Williams.

140
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:50,634
If you had a girl
who was tongue tied

141
00:05:51,646 --> 00:05:51,646
and couldn't take
care of people,

142
00:05:54,575 --> 00:05:54,575
you'd have the passengers
at each other's throats.

143
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:56,599
And I love meeting
people and I love flying.

144
00:05:59,575 --> 00:05:59,575
You know, an airplane is more
than just a piece of metal.

145
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:03,559
- You mind if I take
the one next to yours?

146
00:06:03,594 --> 00:06:03,594
That might be a wonderful
slogan for our company,

147
00:06:04,628 --> 00:06:04,628
your home in the air.

148
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:06,565
If you don't like that
one, Mr. Williams,

149
00:06:08,573 --> 00:06:08,573
I've got a lot of other slogans.

150
00:06:09,606 --> 00:06:09,606
I've wanted to be an
airline stewardess

151
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:10,625
ever since I can remember.

152
00:06:13,609 --> 00:06:13,609
Aviation is the most
exciting thing in the world.

153
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:15,642
You know, God didn't mean
people to be strangers,

154
00:06:18,584 --> 00:06:18,584
and with commercial aviation,
people all over the world

155
00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:19,614
are becoming neighbors.

156
00:06:21,584 --> 00:06:21,584
Let me tell you
about my uncle that

157
00:06:22,577 --> 00:06:22,577
used to fly in the last war.

158
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:24,601
He was my mother's brother,
but you won't believe this.

159
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:25,630
When he started to fly-

160
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:30,599
- June, you go to dormitory DC3.

161
00:06:31,588 --> 00:06:31,588
That's the first room.

162
00:06:32,577 --> 00:06:32,577
- OK.

163
00:06:32,655 --> 00:06:32,655
- Hello.

164
00:06:33,604 --> 00:06:33,604
- Hello.

165
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:34,599

00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:40,505
Now how about moving that ship?

500
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:54,541
- Magazines?

00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:03,509
- Oh, yes.

505
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:04,542
Wouldn't you like
to take your hat off

506
00:21:05,522 --> 00:21:05,522
and be more comfortable?

507
00:21:06,485 --> 00:21:06,485
- Thank you so much.

508
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:09,535
- Miss, if it isn't too much
trouble, I'd like some lunch.

509
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:10,509
- Well, of course.

510
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:12,501
I'm going to serve right away.

511
00:21:13,537 --> 00:21:13,537
Here's something
for you to read.

512
00:21:31,517 --> 00:21:31,517
I couldn't have.

513
00:22:00,562 --> 00:23:00,562
Radio back for instructions.

514
00:22:12,563 --> 00:22:16,511
- Time's lunch?

515
00:22:16,546 --> 00:22:16,546
- That's what I
wanted to talk about.

516
00:22:26,481 --> 00:22:26,481
Well, you see, there was so
much excitement and confusion,

517
00:22:27,552 --> 00:22:27,552
and then one of the
passengers said he was hungry,

518
00:22:31,544 --> 00:22:31,544
and then I went to look-
I forgot to check-

519
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:32,552
- You forgot the food?

520
00:22:34,489 --> 00:22:34,489
- Yes, sir.

521
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:35,479
- What?

522
00:22:36,533 --> 00:22:36,533
- Yes, sir.

523
00:22:40,513 --> 00:22:40,513
- Oh, of all the stewardesses in
this country, I had to get you.

524
00:22:41,556 --> 00:22:41,556
What I'd like to know
what have I done to-

525
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:43,540
- I'm sorry.

526
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:44,520
- (MOCKING TONE) I sorry.

527
00:22:50,538 --> 00:22:50,538
A stewardess's job is to
make a good impression.

528
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:54,464
Now, of course, I'm
only a chauffeur,

529
00:22:57,465 --> 00:22:57,465
but what I'd like you to know is
what an impression you've made

530
00:22:59,474 --> 00:22:59,474
and how indispensable
you've been.

531
00:23:01,526 --> 00:24:01,526
- Well, you know how
it is, schedules

532
00:23:02,496 --> 00:24:01,561
Those passengers have to be fed.

533
00:23:03,479 --> 00:24:01,596
You know what that means?

534
00:23:03,543 --> 00:23:05,460
- Flight 783-

535
00:23:05,495 --> 00:23:05,495
- That means we have to
go back to the airport.

536
00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:06,529
That's 15 minutes lost.

537
00:23:08,495 --> 00:23:08,495
Then land, that's
10 minutes lost.

538
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:09,555
With any luck, we'll get
off a half an hour late

539
00:23:11,561 --> 00:23:11,561
and then we can
start all over again.

540
00:23:14,514 --> 00:23:14,514
It's an hour lost
and you're sorry.

541
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:16,500
- Maybe we won't have to-

542
00:23:39,469 --> 00:23:39,469
- We're back.

543
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:39,559
- But you didn't write.

544
00:23:46,556 --> 00:23:46,556
- I suppose things like
this happen often.

545
00:23:53,511 --> 00:23:53,511
- I've never seen this happen
before, but don't judge by me.

546
00:23:57,532 --> 00:23:57,532
I've only been with the
company for 15 years.

547
00:23:59,555 --> 00:23:59,555
- Are they terribly upset?

548
00:24:03,557 --> 00:24:03,557
and all that nonsense.

549
00:24:07,505 --> 00:24:07,505
Look, if this airplane ever
reaches Nashville, Mr. Thomas,

550
00:24:13,484 --> 00:24:13,484
the operations chief there,
is very anxious to see you.

551
00:24:14,481 --> 00:24:14,481
- He is, huh?

552
00:24:22,457 --> 00:24:22,457
- Well, goodbye again.

553
00:24:30,521 --> 00:24:30,521
- Where do they get
dames like that?

554
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:34,480
She's a menace to
commercial aviation.

555
00:24:36,528 --> 00:24:36,528
- Take it easy, Mike.

556
00:24:39,481 --> 00:24:39,481
You're like a flying busboy.

564
00:25:19,496 --> 00:25:19,496
What did you say her name was?

565
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:21,530
- Marcy Lewis.

566
00:25:23,542 --> 00:25:23,542
- Is Mike really sore?

567
00:25:24,492 --> 00:25:24,492
- Sore?

568
00:25:25,536 --> 00:25:25,536
He wanted to land
in my parachute.

569
00:25:27,471 --> 00:25:27,471
- Thanks for everything, Marcy.

570

00:25:35,542 --> 00:25:35,542
- We enjoyed the trip.

574
00:25:38,463 --> 00:25:38,463
Goodbye.

575
00:25:40,489 --> 00:25:40,489
- Well, I don't know, Mike.

576
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:42,500
This is a pretty serious thing.

577
00:25:44,449 --> 00:25:44,449
We can't just overlook it.

578
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:46,463
- Well, I'm not asking you
to overlook it, Tommy.

579
00:25:49,484 --> 00:25:49,484
I just hope that you won't be
too hard on her, that's all.

580
00:25:50,528 --> 00:25:50,528
Sure, she was excited.

581
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:53,530
It was her first flight.

582
00:25:56,452 --> 00:25:56,452
She's great with passengers.

583
00:25:58,517 --> 00:25:58,517
- Well, I'll see.

584
00:25:59,467 --> 00:25:59,467
- Thanks, Tommy.

585
00:26:00,499 --> 00:27:00,499
I promise you, you
won't be sorry.

586
00:26:06,496 --> 00:27:00,534
- Mr. Thomas?

587
00:26:07,523 --> 00:26:10,433
- Yes.

588
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:10,468
Come over here, Miss Lewis.

589
00:26:11,526 --> 00:26:11,526
- You know who I am?

590
00:26:14,522 --> 00:26:14,522
- The whole airline
knows who you are.

Aviation stocks are tumbling.

592

- I said I was sorry.

593
00:26:23,528 --> 00:26:23,528
I tried to take care
of all the passengers.

594
00:26:26,456 --> 00:26:26,456
I did everything I could
to make them feel at home.

595
00:26:32,462 --> 00:26:32,462
Maybe I tried too hard,
but- anyway, I tried.

596

Well, I don't mind.

I can go back to Havenville.

Furthermore, I'm going by bus.

check your schedule.

goes out in an hour.

Oh.

604
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:58,533
Oh, thank you, Mr. Thomas.

605
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:01,533
- I hope not.

606
00:27:05,454 --> 00:27:05,454
You're flying with Mike Jamison.

607
00:27:06,532 --> 00:27:06,532

Well, anyway, thank you.

- Oh.

613

- You'll be disappointed to
know that I'm not being fired.

614
00:27:24,489 --> 00:27:24,489
- Oh, you don't say?

615
00:27:25,524 --> 00:27:25,524
- Mr. Thomas was
very understanding.

616
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:27,520
He felt it could
have been worse.

617
00:27:28,484 --> 00:27:28,484
- Yes.

618
00:27:29,511 --> 00:27:29,511
You could have
forgotten the airplane.

664
00:30:00,422 --> 00:30:02,468

665
00:30:02,503 --> 00:30:02,503
You're number three

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:04,480

673
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:48,519
- Oh, Jan!

674
00:30:50,511 --> 00:30:50,511
- Hi, Marcy.

675
00:30:51,508 --> 00:30:51,508
- Oh, you look wonderful.

676
00:30:52,504 --> 00:30:52,504
- So do you.

677
00:30:53,499 --> 00:30:53,499
- Is everything all right?

678
00:30:54,449 --> 00:30:54,449
- Just fine.

679
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:55,505
- Oh listen, I've got
so much to tell you,

680
00:30:58,426 --> 00:30:58,426
I don't know what to- I
don't know where to start.

681
00:30:58,479 --> 00:30:58,479
- Start anywhere.

682
00:31:00,472 --> 00:31:00,472
- OK.

683
00:31:01,512 --> 00:31:01,512
- Top of the bottle
came off and spilled

684
00:31:02,492 --> 00:31:02,492
all over the microphone.

685
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:03,440
- This way.

686
00:31:03,511 --> 00:31:03,511
- Well, I knew I had
to do something,

687
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:05,470
so I took my perfume
out and put that on.

688
00:31:06,452 --> 00:31:06,452
- Oh no.

689
00:31:07,511 --> 00:31:07,511
- I told you what happened
on my first flight.

690
00:31:08,479 --> 00:31:08,479
- Didn't have to.

691
00:31:10,462 --> 00:31:10,462
Everybody talked
about it for weeks.

692
00:31:11,472 --> 00:31:11,472
- Oh, this is darling.

693
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:12,491
- Mm-hm.
- Who have you been flying with?

694
00:31:13,452 --> 00:31:13,452
- Well-

695
00:31:14,491 --> 00:31:14,491
- And aren't the
pilots wonderful?

696
00:31:15,481 --> 00:31:15,481
- Absolutely.

697
00:31:16,496 --> 00:31:16,496
- Have you been having any fun?

698
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:17,509
- Well, I- - Hm?

700
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:18,459
Hm?

701
00:31:19,465 --> 00:31:19,465
- Oh, I guess so.

702
00:31:20,473 --> 00:31:20,473
- Oh.

703
00:31:21,473 --> 00:31:21,473
How is Roger?

704
00:31:23,493 --> 00:31:23,493
- Well, he hasn't married
anybody else yet.

705
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:24,480
- That's romantic of him.

706
00:31:26,489 --> 00:31:26,489
You know, you and I may have
to do something about this boy.

707
00:31:27,498 --> 00:31:27,498
- Yeah.

708
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:28,458
Hey, Marcy.

709
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:29,512
Do you realize that
tomorrow, we'll

710
00:31:32,451 --> 00:31:32,451
be flying the Mercury
run to Hollywood?

711
00:31:34,418 --> 00:31:34,418
- You'll love Hollywood, Jan.

712
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:35,429
It's a wonderful place.

713
00:31:36,508 --> 00:31:36,508
Everything out there is
touched with a kind of magic.

714
00:31:38,452 --> 00:31:38,452
- Gee, it sounds wonderful.

715
00:31:39,454 --> 00:31:39,454
When were you there?

716
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:40,441
- This'll be my first trip.

717
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:41,508
- Oh honestly, Marcy.

718
00:31:42,457 --> 00:31:42,457
- What?

719
00:31:52,447 --> 00:31:52,447
ANNOUNCER (OFFSCREEN): United
Airlines mainliner service

720
00:31:57,442 --> 00:31:57,442
Flight 608 from Los Angeles
now arriving at Gate Two.

721
00:32:01,434 --> 00:32:22,395
(WHISPERING) Where is he?

722
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:22,430
- I'm going to turn
the oven off, Jan.

723
00:32:22,481 --> 00:32:22,481
- OK.

724
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:23,500
Number three?

725
00:32:24,478 --> 00:32:24,478
- Mm-hm.

726
00:32:27,449 --> 00:32:27,449
Did you take a look at all
the passengers on board?

727
00:32:28,438 --> 00:32:28,438
- Mm-hm.

728
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:28,488
Why?

729
00:32:30,465 --> 00:32:30,465
Did anybody leave?

730
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:32,467
- No, but there's a man
named Michael Lawrence

731
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:33,490
I've got a feeling about.

732
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:34,490
- What kind of a feeling?

733
00:32:37,437 --> 00:32:37,437
I need two milks.

734
00:32:39,466 --> 00:32:39,466
- Nothing, except I
think he's a VIP.

735
00:32:41,505 --> 00:32:41,505
- The list didn't say anything
about a very important person.

736
00:32:43,427 --> 00:32:43,427
- Well, he isn't listed.

737
00:32:44,491 --> 00:32:44,491
It's just a feeling.

738
00:32:46,482 --> 00:32:46,482
- Sort of an intuition?

739
00:32:47,449 --> 00:32:47,449
- Yeah, sort of.

740
00:32:49,463 --> 00:32:49,463
- Think it's too early
to get the desserts out?

741
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:52,470
- Are you ready to serve?

742
00:32:54,443 --> 00:32:54,443
- Now, Marcy, these
intuitions of yours.

743
00:33:03,424 --> 00:33:03,424
- Up front.

744
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:04,470
- His head looks fine.

745
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:06,417
I'll take his dinner
and let you know.

746
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:07,440
- Thank you very much.

747
00:33:16,445 --> 00:33:16,445
Here's your dinner,
Mr. Lawrence.

748
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:18,440
- Thank you.

749
00:33:18,493 --> 00:33:18,493
- You're welcome.

750
00:33:45,447 --> 00:33:45,447
- Did you enjoy your
dinner, Mr. Lawrence?

751
00:33:46,445 --> 00:33:46,445
- Yes, thank you.

752
00:33:50,455 --> 00:33:50,455
- Did you have enough?

753
00:33:53,446 --> 00:33:53,446
- Yes, thank you.

754
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:55,409
- Would you like some
more hot coffee?

755
00:33:56,404 --> 00:33:56,404
- Mm-mm.

756
00:33:56,498 --> 00:33:56,498
- What?

757
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:57,493
- No thank you.

758
00:34:05,427 --> 00:34:05,427
- This plane is going
to be 48 hours late.

759
00:34:05,487 --> 00:34:05,487
- That's nice.

760
00:35:00,484 --> 00:36:00,484
Did you know that the
Big Dipper scoops up

761
00:35:10,428 --> 00:35:10,913
- Hello.

762
00:35:10,948 --> 00:35:11,399
- Oh good.

763
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:12,420
You're awake.

764
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:12,486
- Oh wow.

765
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:16,405
So am I. Wh- what's your name?

766
00:35:16,455 --> 00:35:16,455
- Natalie.

767
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:17,479
What's yours?

768
00:35:18,459 --> 00:35:18,459
- My name's Mike.

769
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:19,452
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

770
00:35:20,427 --> 00:35:20,427
Did she disturb you?

771
00:35:21,441 --> 00:35:21,441
- Oh, that's all right.

772
00:35:24,432 --> 00:35:24,432
She got lonesome, I guess, and
needed somebody to talk to.

773
00:35:26,475 --> 00:35:26,475
- Don't you think you'd
better go to sleep, now?

774
00:35:28,411 --> 00:35:28,411
- I'm not the least bit sleepy.

775
00:35:30,415 --> 00:35:30,415
- Oh, why don't you let
her sit there a minute?

776
00:35:30,465 --> 00:35:30,465
She's- over-

777
00:35:31,485 --> 00:35:31,485
- Are you sure she
won't disturb you?

778
00:35:32,448 --> 00:35:32,448
- No, no.

779
00:35:36,432 --> 00:35:36,432
- Don't you think
Mike is handsome?

780
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:41,410
- Well, I- yes, I- I do.

781
00:35:42,401 --> 00:35:42,401
- Thanks.

782
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:43,489
- Wouldn't you like me
to tell you a story?

783
00:35:46,461 --> 00:35:46,461
- I don't think so, thank you.

784
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:48,416
- Have you ever flown before?

785
00:35:48,466 --> 00:35:48,466
- Oh yes.

786
00:35:51,407 --> 00:35:51,407
I love to watch the stars.

787
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:52,448
- You do?

788
00:35:55,436 --> 00:35:55,436
Well, there's the
Big Dipper out there.

789
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:57,430
See it?

790
00:35:59,428 --> 00:35:59,428
And there's the Milky Way.

791
00:36:00,436 --> 00:36:02,418
If you had a house
on the moon, you'd

792
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:04,400
all the milk that
passes through the sky?

793
00:36:06,442 --> 00:36:06,442
- Did you know that, Mike?

794
00:36:10,449 --> 00:36:10,449
- Well, actually, the Big Dipper,
or Ursa Major, as it is called,

795
00:36:14,404 --> 00:36:14,404
is used very little
to scoop up milk.

796
00:36:15,455 --> 00:36:15,455
For many years, the
sailors have been

797
00:36:18,438 --> 00:36:18,438
using it to find
Polaris, the North Star.

798
00:36:20,437 --> 00:36:20,437
That's the beacon light
that guides them safely

799
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:22,417
home from voyages
all over the world.

800
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:27,416
You see that group
of stars over there

801
00:36:29,389 --> 00:36:29,389
that resemble a big chair?

802
00:36:29,486 --> 00:36:29,486
That's Cassiopeia.

803
00:36:32,437 --> 00:36:32,437
It's known as the seated lady.

804
00:36:35,419 --> 00:36:35,419
Further south, just out
of sight of Pleiades.

805
00:36:38,454 --> 00:36:38,454
Long ago, the Babylonians called
them the many little ones,

806
00:36:41,396 --> 00:36:41,396
the ancient Greeks called
them the seven sisters,

807
00:36:42,414 --> 00:36:42,414
and to the American
Indians, they

808
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:45,436
were known as the
seven brothers.

809
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:48,456
- Do- do you know about
the man in the moon?

810
00:36:51,393 --> 00:36:51,393
- I don't think Mr. Lawrence
can answer that question

811
00:36:54,475 --> 00:36:54,475
unless Mr. Lawrence
has been to the moon.

812
00:36:56,458 --> 00:36:56,458
- I can tell you a little
about the moon, Natalie.

813
00:36:59,412 --> 00:36:59,412
I've been there in a telescope.

814
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,441
I'll just get her a pillow.

815
00:37:02,476 --> 00:37:02,476
never have to clean it because
there's no dust up there,

816
00:37:05,402 --> 00:37:05,402
and you wouldn't need
any glass in your windows

817
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:07,434
because there's no rain
or wind to keep out.

818
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:09,438
And you can't hear
any noise up there.

819
00:37:11,384 --> 00:37:11,384
- That would be nice.

820
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:12,397
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

821
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:14,466
Don't you think you
ought to go to sleep now?

822
00:37:17,429 --> 00:37:17,429
- I think I could if
I had my dog with me.

823
00:37:18,467 --> 00:37:18,467
- Oh, where is he?

824
00:37:21,423 --> 00:37:21,423

00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:51,400
I'm sorry the place
is such a mess.

992
00:42:52,407 --> 00:42:52,407
We're just having it landscaped.

993
00:42:54,401 --> 00:42:54,401
- Oh, I know it's terrible,
but honestly, Marcy, I

994
00:42:56,356 --> 00:42:56,356
couldn't find anything better.

995
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:56,449
- You mean this isn't a joke?

996
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:58,370
- Well, we all live
in jokes like this.

997
00:42:59,360 --> 00:42:59,360
There's a housing shortage.

998
00:43:00,433 --> 00:43:01,362
an interest in a small child.

999
00:43:01,397 --> 00:43:01,397
You know, last night,
she wouldn't come in

1000
00:43:02,415 --> 00:43:02,415
until I turned the lights off.

1001
00:43:08,412 --> 00:43:08,412
- I've got it.

1002
00:43:09,405 --> 00:43:09,405
- She's got it.

1003
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:10,390
- Well, there goes
the housing shortage.

1004
00:43:11,443 --> 00:43:11,443
- I don't know why I
didn't think of it before.

1005
00:43:13,366 --> 00:43:13,366
There are four of
us, and if we pool

1006
00:43:14,389 --> 00:43:14,389
what we're paying
right now, we could

1007
00:43:15,417 --> 00:43:15,417
have a lovely little house.

1008
00:43:16,404 --> 00:43:16,404
- That sounds wonderful.

1009
00:43:17,388 --> 00:43:17,388
- What do you say?

1010
00:43:17,438 --> 00:43:17,438
- Oh, I say yes.

1011
00:43:18,402 --> 00:43:18,402
- Yes, indeed.

1012
00:43:21,385 --> 00:43:21,385
- Now we can invite more-

1013
00:43:23,398 --> 00:43:23,398
- Listen, let's talk
about it over lunches.

1014
00:43:24,415 --> 00:43:24,415
- Oh, there's a
wonderful restaurant

1015
00:43:25,388 --> 00:43:25,388
where we all hang out.

1016
00:43:25,438 --> 00:43:25,438
- Oh good.

1017
00:43:26,389 --> 00:43:26,389
Well, let's go.

1018
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:26,439
- Marcy!

1019
00:43:27,389 --> 00:43:27,389
- What?

1020
00:43:30,363 --> 00:43:30,363
- Where's your hat?

1021
00:43:31,446 --> 00:43:31,446
- I'll get dressed in a hurry.

1022
00:43:32,396 --> 00:43:32,396
Come on.

1023
00:43:38,435 --> 00:43:38,435
- Gee, this is a cute place.

1024
00:43:41,363 --> 00:43:41,363
- You'd never mistake the
cooking for mother's, but prices

1025
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:41,413
are reasonable.

1026
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:42,420
- You'd mistake it for my mother.

1027
00:43:43,421 --> 00:43:43,421
She's an awful cook.

1028
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:44,421
- Look, let's order right away.

1029
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:46,423
I can't wait to start
looking for a house.

1030
00:43:47,434 --> 00:43:47,434
- Where is the best
place to live?

1031
00:43:49,439 --> 00:43:49,439
- We're going to have to
take anything we can get.

1032
00:43:51,412 --> 00:43:51,412
- You know, Alice and I
have to fly this afternoon,

1033
00:43:54,356 --> 00:43:54,356
so if you'll drop us off at the
airport, you can take the car

1034
00:43:55,404 --> 00:43:55,404
and pick up a map,
and then good luck.

1035
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:56,380
- Good.

1036
00:43:58,389 --> 00:43:58,389
- It's a shame about you
being grounded, Marcy.

1037
00:43:59,406 --> 00:43:59,406
- Well, that's what
I get for taking

1038
00:44:00,340 --> 00:45:00,340
I flew to Chicago to attend
a research conference.

1039
00:44:03,380 --> 00:45:00,375
- You should get a look
at that small child.

1040
00:44:03,439 --> 00:44:06,366
- Oh?

1041
00:44:06,401 --> 00:44:06,401
- Well now, it's not
what you think at all.

1042
00:44:08,348 --> 00:44:08,348
He's some kind of a scientist.

1043
00:44:10,354 --> 00:44:10,354
He communes with time
and space and things.

1044
00:44:12,357 --> 00:44:12,357
- Sounds just like a cousin
of mine from South Carolina.

1045
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:13,390
They finally put him away.

1046
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:14,370
- What does he look like?

1047
00:44:15,347 --> 00:44:15,347
- Oh, he was a cute
little old kid.

1048
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:15,402
He was fine.

1049
00:44:16,422 --> 00:44:16,422
- Quiet, Alice.

1050
00:44:17,382 --> 00:44:17,382
- Oh, I don't know.

1051
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:19,350
He's, um, he's tall.

1052
00:44:21,435 --> 00:44:21,435
He has light hair.

1053
00:44:22,385 --> 00:44:22,385
Jan.

1054
00:44:31,391 --> 00:44:31,391
- Well, looks like your scientist
also communes with spirits.

1055
00:44:32,382 --> 00:44:32,382
- Excuse me.

1056
00:44:33,378 --> 00:44:33,378
Don't stare.

1057
00:44:39,418 --> 00:44:39,418
- Hello.

1058
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:40,420
- Hello.

1059
00:44:44,394 --> 00:44:44,394
- If you don't recognize me,
it's because I'm out of uniform.

1060
00:44:46,387 --> 00:44:46,387
- You're out of
uni- oh, of course.

1061
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:48,370
You're, um, Poochie's friend.

1062
00:44:49,402 --> 00:44:49,402
- Yes, let's not go into that.

1063
00:44:51,373 --> 00:44:51,373
I want to talk to you.

1064
00:44:52,412 --> 00:44:52,412
- Must be this apron.

1065
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:54,390
As soon as I put it on,
everybody wants to talk to me?

1066
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:56,370
- What are you, a
flying bartender?

1067
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:57,361
- Oh that.

1068
00:44:57,421 --> 00:44:57,421
No.

1069
00:45:00,386 --> 00:45:03,373
- Well, there it is.

1070
00:45:03,408 --> 00:45:03,408
- Do bartenders have
research conferences?

1071
00:45:04,357 --> 00:45:04,357
- Oh, no.

1072
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:05,436
The university sent me back.

1073
00:45:08,366 --> 00:45:08,366
I do this because,
contrary to public opinion,

1074
00:45:10,429 --> 00:45:10,429
graduate research
students have to eat.

1075
00:45:13,339 --> 00:45:13,339
That's what I am,
graduate research student.

1076
00:45:14,374 --> 00:45:14,374
- I see.

1077
00:45:16,407 --> 00:45:16,407
I'm awfully glad.

1078
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:17,390
- Why?

1079
00:45:20,394 --> 00:45:20,394
- Oh, just confirms a
feeling I had about you.

1080
00:45:23,368 --> 00:45:23,368
- What kind of a feeling?

1081
00:45:25,412 --> 00:45:25,412
- Oh, just a feeling.

1082
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:26,424
I'll be seeing you.

1083
00:45:33,373 --> 00:45:33,373
- What is that?

1084
00:45:36,337 --> 00:45:36,337
- Old Oak Road, Old Oak Lane.

1085
00:45:38,391 --> 00:45:38,391
- We seem to have misplaced
Sunset Boulevard.

1086
00:45:40,408 --> 00:45:40,408
What does it say on the map?

1087
00:45:42,362 --> 00:45:42,362
- And it says we're lost.

1088
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:44,350
- Let me see.

1089
00:45:46,389 --> 00:45:46,389
- You have to drop everything and
leave for London by tomorrow.

1090
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:47,339
- Right, Mike.

1091
00:45:49,404 --> 00:45:49,404
Tell them I'm adding a whole
new advertising campaign.

1092
00:45:52,351 --> 00:45:52,351
I want you to report to me as
soon as you've met with Henley.

1093
00:45:53,389 --> 00:45:53,389
- This new campaign
of yours is great.

1094
00:45:54,391 --> 00:45:54,391
They're going to love it.

1095
00:45:55,395 --> 00:45:55,395
- I hope so.

1096
00:45:56,374 --> 00:45:56,374
- You'd better get going.

1097
00:45:57,365 --> 00:45:57,365
- What is this?

1098
00:45:57,415 --> 00:45:57,415
Old Oak?

1099
00:45:59,356 --> 00:45:59,356
- Mm-hm.

1100
00:46:00,406 --> 00:46:00,871
- OK.

1101
00:46:00,906 --> 00:46:01,336
- Good.

1102
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:01,370
- Hm.

1103
00:46:01,423 --> 00:46:01,423
Now, let me see.

1104
00:46:04,373 --> 00:46:04,373
I have to- left,
I have to turn.

1105
00:46:07,355 --> 00:46:07,355
- Thank you.

1106
00:46:08,426 --> 00:46:08,426
What's the matter?

1107
00:46:09,409 --> 00:46:09,409
- Battery's dead.

1108
00:46:10,426 --> 00:46:10,426
- Oh no.

1109
00:46:11,376 --> 00:46:11,376
- So are we.

1110
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:13,353
OTTO (OFFSCREEN): I don't
know where I'm staying yet.

1111
00:46:14,425 --> 00:46:14,425
I'll cable you as
soon as I get there.

1112
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:16,375
MIKE (OFFSCREEN): OK,
have a good trip, Otto.

1113
00:46:18,399 --> 00:46:18,399
OTTO (OFFSCREEN): Thanks, Mike.

1114
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:20,344
- Oh, there's a cab.

1115
00:46:20,394 --> 00:46:20,394
Hey!

1116
00:46:23,385 --> 00:46:23,385
Hey, hey, wait a minute.

1117
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:25,380
- Huh?

1118
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:27,350
- He got away.

1119
00:46:28,413 --> 00:46:28,413
- What's the matter?

1120
00:46:30,334 --> 00:46:30,334
- The battery's dead.

1121
00:46:31,364 --> 00:46:31,364
- We need a push.

1122
00:46:32,354 --> 00:46:32,354
- You sure it's the battery?

1123
00:46:33,396 --> 00:46:33,396
- I think so.

1124
00:46:34,399 --> 00:46:34,399
- Is there gas in your tank?

1125
00:46:35,374 --> 00:46:35,374
- Yeah.

1126
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:36,375
- Maybe your starter's stuck.

1127
00:46:36,427 --> 00:46:36,427
Step out.

1128
00:46:37,403 --> 00:46:37,403
I'll take a look at it.

1129
00:46:38,398 --> 00:46:38,398
- All right.

1130
00:46:46,414 --> 00:46:46,414
- Your battery's dead.

1131
00:46:48,334 --> 00:46:48,334
- Isn't it nice to
have a man around?

1132
00:46:50,354 --> 00:46:50,354
- Will you give us a push?

1133
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:52,380
Get in the front seat, honey,
and turn the wheels that way.

1134
00:46:53,354 --> 00:46:53,354
We're going left.

1135
00:46:54,403 --> 00:46:54,403
- OK.

1136
00:46:56,371 --> 00:46:56,371
- Turn the ignition
on, put it in second,

1137
00:46:59,365 --> 00:46:59,365
push your clutch in, and let it
out, and we start to roll OK?

1138
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:02,343
I've got a hunting license.

1139
00:47:02,378 --> 00:47:02,378
- Well, can't you
push any harder?

1140
00:47:14,405 --> 00:47:14,405
[CAR STARTS]

1141
00:47:15,355 --> 00:47:15,355
- Oh!

1142
00:47:16,354 --> 00:47:16,354
Did you hurt yourself?

1143
00:47:16,404 --> 00:47:16,404
- No.

1144
00:47:18,353 --> 00:47:18,353
I'm fine.

1145
00:47:18,403 --> 00:47:18,403
- Oh.

1146
00:47:20,352 --> 00:47:20,352
Oh, well wait a minute.

1147
00:47:24,399 --> 00:47:24,399
Here.

1148
00:47:25,398 --> 00:47:25,398
Thanks a lot.

1149
00:47:27,347 --> 00:47:27,347
Th- thanks a lot.

1150
00:47:27,397 --> 00:47:27,397
- Thank you.

1151
00:47:28,347 --> 00:47:28,347

they made soap in the old days.

1314
00:52:08,396 --> 00:52:08,396
We can use posters
of the pioneers,

1315
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:12,299
contrast these posters with
the modern Gardenia soap plan.

1316
00:52:13,318 --> 00:52:13,318
- I like that.

1317
00:52:14,324 --> 00:52:14,324
- That stinks.

1318
00:52:16,335 --> 00:52:16,335
If I want to educate people,
I'll build a college.

1319
00:52:16,385 --> 00:52:16,385
- All right.

1320
00:52:18,328 --> 00:52:18,328
I'll find another approach.

1321
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:19,370
- I have an idea.

1322
00:52:20,362 --> 00:52:20,362
- I have a better one.

1323
00:52:21,312 --> 00:52:21,312
Let's dance.

1324
00:52:22,337 --> 00:52:22,337
- All right.

1325
00:52:23,315 --> 00:52:23,315
Excuse me.

1326
00:52:23,365 --> 00:52:23,365
- Certainly.

1327
00:52:36,303 --> 00:52:36,303
- Sorry we got
involved in business.

1328
00:52:37,344 --> 00:52:37,344
- Oh, I didn't mind.

1329
00:52:38,327 --> 00:52:38,327
Mr. Bellemy likes you.

1330
00:52:40,306 --> 00:52:40,306
I can tell.

1331
00:52:41,335 --> 00:52:41,335
- That's one thing
about old Bellemy.

1332
00:52:44,363 --> 00:52:44,363
He's got a tough exterior, but
inside, he has a heart of rock.

1333
00:52:47,326 --> 00:52:47,326
- He was a little
rough on your idea.

1334
00:52:48,349 --> 00:52:48,349
You know, I have an idea.

1335
00:52:49,362 --> 00:52:49,362
- And so have I,
and it has nothing

1336
00:52:50,393 --> 00:52:50,393
to do with gardenia soap.

1337
00:52:55,363 --> 00:52:55,363
You're a wonderful dancer.

1338
00:52:58,303 --> 00:52:58,303
- You make me look good.

1339
00:53:03,311 --> 00:53:03,311
The art of flattering
men seems to be lost.

1340
00:53:06,298 --> 00:53:06,298
Women can't seem to lie
the way they used to.

1341
00:53:08,366 --> 00:53:08,366
- Oh, we do all right.

1342
00:53:11,329 --> 00:53:11,329
You know, I really
think I know what

1343
00:53:12,376 --> 00:53:12,376
would appeal to Mr. Bellemy.

1344
00:53:14,352 --> 00:53:14,352
- Honey, honey, look,
the office is closed.

1345
00:53:16,367 --> 00:53:16,367
Look, if you're so eager
to sell gardenia soap,

1346
00:53:18,317 --> 00:53:18,317
why don't you
write him a letter?

1347
00:53:18,381 --> 00:53:18,381
- I'm sorry.

1348
00:53:22,339 --> 00:53:22,339
- That's the girl I've
adored all these years.

1349
00:53:25,334 --> 00:53:25,334
You see, if two people
really love each other,

1350
00:53:27,367 --> 00:53:27,367
these little spats
can be patched up.

1351
00:53:28,361 --> 00:53:28,361
- Yes, Mike.

1352
00:53:35,364 --> 00:53:35,364
- I'm awfully glad the
battery in your car ran down.

1353
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:37,360
We should celebrate every
anniversary in a garage.

1354
00:53:42,304 --> 00:53:42,304
Um, where would you
like to go from here?

1355
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:43,350
- Oh, I don't care.

1356
00:53:45,296 --> 00:53:45,296
Anyplace you like.

1357
00:53:47,388 --> 00:53:47,388
- Maybe we should get
home to the children?

1358
00:53:50,349 --> 00:53:50,349
- Oh, I think the governess
could take care of them all.

1359
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:52,360
- Oh.

1360
00:53:54,335 --> 00:53:54,335
How many do we have?

1361
00:53:56,328 --> 00:53:56,328
- Six.

1362
00:53:56,378 --> 00:53:56,378
- Oh.

1363
00:54:05,354 --> 00:54:05,354
- Drinky?

1364
00:54:14,316 --> 00:54:14,316
- Gee, I hate to leave you
alone with all this stuff.

1365
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:15,380
With the other
kids flying too, I

1366
00:54:17,347 --> 00:54:17,347
don't see how you can handle it.

1367
00:54:18,357 --> 00:54:18,357
- Well, at least
they'll have time

1368
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:20,323
to load their things in
the car before they leave.

1369
00:54:21,331 --> 00:54:21,331
- Yeah, once the trunks get here.

1370
00:54:23,324 --> 00:54:23,324
- Well, old Mother
Necessity will find a way.

1371
00:54:24,337 --> 00:54:24,337
Look, you'd better
get out of here

1372
00:54:26,328 --> 00:54:26,328
before your passengers
have to serve themselves.

1373
00:54:27,286 --> 00:54:27,286
- OK, OK.

1374
00:54:28,338 --> 00:54:28,338
I- I'll see you tomorrow
at the new house.

1375
00:54:29,288 --> 00:54:29,288
- OK.

1376
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:33,330
- Oh, and Marcy,
that's my best suit.

1377
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:34,371
Don't put it on the
floor of the car, huh?

1378
00:54:35,343 --> 00:54:35,343
- All right, all
right, you know me.

1379
00:54:36,325 --> 00:54:36,325
I don't make any mistakes.
- Yes, I do.

1380
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:36,375
Bye!

1381
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:38,358
- Bye.

1382
00:54:39,308 --> 00:54:39,308
Now.

1383
00:55:00,346 --> 00:56:00,346
- Hi, how do you do?

1384
00:55:15,313 --> 00:55:16,313
- Good morning.
- You're new, huh?

1385
00:55:16,353 --> 00:55:16,353
- Yes.

1386
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:18,280
- Well, I guess you'll
be wanting milk.

1387
00:55:19,305 --> 00:55:19,305
- Well, not right now.

1388
00:55:20,324 --> 00:55:20,324
Would you do something for me?
- Sure.

1389
00:55:20,374 --> 00:55:20,374
What?

1390
00:55:21,369 --> 00:55:21,369
- See the box up front?

1391
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:22,319
- Yeah.

1392
00:55:23,326 --> 00:55:23,326
- Would you mind taking that out?

1393
00:55:24,322 --> 00:55:24,322
- No trouble at all.

1394
00:55:24,372 --> 00:55:24,372
- It's heavy.

1395
00:55:25,338 --> 00:55:25,338
- I'll watch them.

1396
00:55:26,287 --> 00:55:26,287
- Morning.

Moving in?

1398
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:27,291
- Good morning.

00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:27,340
Yes.

1400
00:55:28,352 --> 00:55:28,352
- I'm your new baker.

1401
00:55:29,302 --> 00:55:29,302
- Oh.

1402
00:55:30,372 --> 00:55:30,372
Well, there are going
to be four of us.

1403
00:55:32,285 --> 00:55:32,285
We're going to eat
a lot of bread.

1404
00:55:32,335 --> 00:55:32,335
- Yeah.

1405
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:33,350
- Say, would you give us a hand?

1406
00:55:34,303 --> 00:55:34,303
- Pleasure, lady.

- Marcy!

- Hi, Mike.

1410
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:40,280
- I'm late.

1411
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:41,280
I went down the wrong street.

1412
00:55:41,345 --> 00:55:41,345
- Oh, gee.

1413

You're an angel to
come over and help.

1414

- I think we can manage.

No neon signs?

00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:48,318
- Whoa.

Hey, that's quite a
mansion you've got there.

- Well, Mike, what
are you doing here?

1419
00:55:53,347 --> 00:55:53,347
- I just flew into Boston,
ran into Jan at the airport.

She told me you were having

This is Mr. Lawrence, Mr. Tracy.

- Well, what's the problem?

That one has got glass in it.

When did you get in?

- Oh, I don't think Miss Lewis
would be interested in that.

1638
01:03:21,243 --> 01:03:21,243
- Oh, but I am.

1639
01:03:21,293 --> 01:03:21,293
- Really?

1640
01:03:22,292 --> 01:03:22,292
- Course she is.

1641
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:25,259
The Bricker Fellowship is
awarded only once a year

1642
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:26,300
to an outstanding scientist.

1643
01:03:28,313 --> 01:03:28,313
It's based on achievement
and character,

1644
01:03:30,265 --> 01:03:30,265
and this year, Mike is
one of the nominees.

1645
01:03:31,282 --> 01:03:31,282
- Well, that's a great honor.

1646
01:03:33,297 --> 01:03:33,297
- Oh, it's very
flattering, I think, too.

1647
01:03:36,236 --> 01:03:36,236
I- if I win, it means
a teaching job here,

1648
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:37,300
and I can go on
with my experiments.

1649
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:38,280
- I hope you do.

1650
01:03:39,323 --> 01:03:39,323
- I do, too.

1651
01:03:41,288 --> 01:03:41,288
- Do you think he will, Doctor?

1652
01:03:42,282 --> 01:03:42,282
- I'm not allowed to say.

1653
01:03:44,247 --> 01:03:44,247
I'm on the selection committee.

1654
01:03:45,301 --> 01:03:45,301
Would you like to hear
my relativity joke?

1655
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:46,260
- Oh, Doctor.

1656
01:03:46,317 --> 01:03:46,317
- Yes, I'd love to

1657
01:03:47,267 --> 01:03:47,267
- All right.

1658
01:03:49,301 --> 01:03:49,301
- Ask me to explain the
theory of relativity.

1659
01:03:50,267 --> 01:03:50,267
- All right.

1660
01:03:52,268 --> 01:03:52,268
Will you explain the
theory of relativity?

1661
01:03:55,257 --> 01:03:55,257
- Well, when you're sitting
in a dentist's chair for five

1662
01:03:57,284 --> 01:03:57,284
minutes, it seems
like five years,

1663
01:03:59,258 --> 01:03:59,258
but when you're
holding a pretty girl

1664
01:04:02,319 --> 01:05:02,319
In that way, you become
projected into the future.

1665
01:04:04,275 --> 01:04:04,755
- I see.

1666
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:05,236
- Oh.

1667
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:07,261
When Einstein tells it,
he gets belly laughs.

1668
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:08,311
- He never gives
up on that story.

1669
01:04:09,318 --> 01:04:09,318
- Well someday, you'll see.

1670
01:04:10,292 --> 01:04:10,292
- You bet.

1671
01:04:12,304 --> 01:04:12,304
Someday, it'll be one of
the school traditions,

1672
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:16,285
talk about Dr. Hardy's
relatively joke.

1673
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:18,254
- You love all of
this, don't you, Mike?

1674
01:04:19,259 --> 01:04:19,259
- You mean the lab?

1675
01:04:22,257 --> 01:04:22,257
- The lab, the campus, your work.

1676
01:04:23,315 --> 01:04:23,315
It shows in your face.

1677
01:04:24,294 --> 01:04:24,294
- It does?

1678
01:04:26,278 --> 01:04:26,278
- Mm-hm.

1679
01:04:28,277 --> 01:04:28,277
- I'm afraid I'm just
a teacher at heart.

1680
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:30,240
- Well, that's wonderful.

1681
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:31,325
- Now you're being polite.

1682
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:33,320
- No, I'm not.

1683
01:04:35,301 --> 01:04:35,301
- You mention the word
"teacher" to anybody,

1684
01:04:37,326 --> 01:04:37,326
and right away, they think
of a little, underpaid absent

1685
01:04:41,227 --> 01:04:41,227
minded Mr. Chips character
wearing an alpaca jacket

1686
01:04:43,252 --> 01:04:43,252
and surrounded by dusty books.

1687
01:04:46,303 --> 01:04:46,303
They don't understand, but
teaching is just about as close

1688
01:04:48,295 --> 01:04:48,295
to immortality as you can come.

1689
01:04:51,273 --> 01:04:51,273
You know, in every
class that you teach,

1690
01:04:53,257 --> 01:04:53,257
someone will remember
something you say,

1691
01:04:56,282 --> 01:04:56,282
and because of it, his life
will be changed a little,

1692
01:04:59,261 --> 01:04:59,261
and he'll changed
someone else's life.

1693
01:05:00,257 --> 01:05:06,281
- Learned about bioluminescence.

1694
01:05:06,316 --> 01:05:06,316
I'm lecturing, and you're
not even registered.

1695
01:05:09,244 --> 01:05:09,244
- I'm registered, Mike.

1696
01:05:10,287 --> 01:05:10,287
My mother was a teacher.

1697
01:05:12,282 --> 01:05:12,282
- Really I didn't know that?

1698
01:05:13,232 --> 01:05:13,232
- Mm-hm.

1699
01:05:13,292 --> 01:05:13,292
You'd like mother.

1700
01:05:16,295 --> 01:05:16,295
MIKE (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, I'm sure I would.

1701
01:05:18,234 --> 01:05:18,234
You're not at all like
I thought you'd be.

1702
01:05:18,303 --> 01:05:18,303
MARCY (OFFSCREEN): I'm not?

1703
01:05:19,283 --> 01:05:19,283
MIKE (OFFSCREEN): Uh-uh.

1704
01:05:20,276 --> 01:05:20,276
Not at all.

1705
01:05:22,299 --> 01:05:22,299
MARCY (OFFSCREEN): I was brought
up in a little college town.

1706
01:05:23,246 --> 01:05:23,246
MIKE (OFFSCREEN): Really?

1707
01:05:24,229 --> 01:05:24,229
MARCY (OFFSCREEN): Mm-hm.

1708
01:05:26,228 --> 01:05:26,228
I love this life.

1709
01:05:27,318 --> 01:05:27,318
Some people think it's
sheltered and unimportant.

1710
01:05:29,237 --> 01:05:29,237
- Oh no.

1711
01:05:30,263 --> 01:05:30,263
- It's terribly important.

1712
01:05:31,238 --> 01:05:31,238
- I think so too.

1713
01:05:31,311 --> 01:05:31,311
- And very exciting.

1714
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:32,261
- Mm-hm.

1715
01:05:35,248 --> 01:05:35,248
- Mike?

1716
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:35,298
- What?

1717
01:05:37,304 --> 01:05:37,304
- I'm so glad we met.

1718
01:05:41,313 --> 01:05:41,313
- So am I. Well,
if you don't mind,

1719
01:05:44,252 --> 01:05:44,252
Doctor- oh, I guess he doesn't.

1720
01:05:50,302 --> 01:05:50,302
- How was your date last night?

1721
01:05:51,311 --> 01:05:51,311
- Oh, we had fun.

1722
01:05:53,310 --> 01:05:53,310
He's a very
remarkable young man.

1723
01:05:54,281 --> 01:05:54,281
- What did you do?

1724
01:05:55,277 --> 01:05:55,277
- You want some coffee?

1725
01:05:56,265 --> 01:05:56,265
- Mm-hm.

1726
01:05:58,222 --> 01:05:58,222
- What'd you do last night?

1727
01:06:00,278 --> 01:06:00,762
- Yes.

1728
01:06:00,797 --> 01:06:01,247
- Oh.

1729
01:06:02,246 --> 01:06:02,246
[TELEPHONE RINGING]

1730
01:06:02,296 --> 01:06:02,296
- I'll get it.

1731
01:06:04,225 --> 01:06:04,225
- Do you want some coffee, Jan?

1732
01:06:05,224 --> 01:06:05,224
- Mm-hm, please.

1733
01:06:09,222 --> 01:06:09,222
- JAN (OFFSCREEN): Hello?

1734
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:10,220
Oh, yes.

1735
01:06:12,269 --> 01:06:12,269
That's it.

1736
01:06:13,256 --> 01:06:13,256
- It's Mike.

1737
01:06:13,306 --> 01:06:13,306
- Hm?

1738
01:06:14,299 --> 01:06:14,299
- It's Mike.

1739
01:06:15,249 --> 01:06:15,249
- Oh.

1740
01:06:15,299 --> 01:06:15,299
Thanks.

1741
01:06:21,221 --> 01:06:21,221
- Did you hear what she
learned last night?

1742
01:06:21,312 --> 01:06:21,312
- Good morning, professor.

1743
01:06:24,239 --> 01:06:24,239
How are all the test tubes?

1744
01:06:26,224 --> 01:06:26,224
Oh, Mickey.

1745
01:06:28,277 --> 01:06:28,277
Well, how are you?

1746
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:30,270
Um, what happened?

1747
01:06:31,314 --> 01:06:31,314
Well, I didn't-

1748
01:06:32,308 --> 01:06:32,308
- Shh.

1749
01:06:33,258 --> 01:06:33,258
- All right.

1750
01:06:35,299 --> 01:06:35,299
I'll come down this afternoon.

1751
01:06:38,289 --> 01:06:38,289
All right, I'll come
down right away.

1752
01:06:39,261 --> 01:06:39,261
All right.

1753
01:06:39,311 --> 01:06:39,311
Goodbye.

1754
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:45,230
- I seem to be in trouble again.

1755
01:06:46,226 --> 01:06:46,226
- What did you do?

1756
01:06:48,277 --> 01:06:48,277
- He didn't say, but I did it.

1757
01:06:50,251 --> 01:06:50,251
Hm.

1758
01:06:53,228 --> 01:06:53,228
Oh, take this upstairs.

1759
01:06:55,251 --> 01:06:55,251
Worry myself to death sometimes.

1760
01:06:57,231 --> 01:06:57,231
- You know, maybe she shouldn't
have learned about bi-

1761
01:06:58,295 --> 01:06:58,295
- Alice, finish your breakfast.

1762
01:07:01,265 --> 01:07:01,265
- I can't eat.

1763
01:07:02,210 --> 01:08:02,210
Honey, I spent 30
minutes on the phone

1764
01:07:05,286 --> 01:08:02,245
- Miss Lewis, Mr. Tracy.

1765
01:07:07,226 --> 01:07:08,270
- Hello, Marcy.

1766
01:07:08,305 --> 01:07:08,305
This is Mr. Tanner, Mr. Osgood.

1767
01:07:09,259 --> 01:07:09,309
- How do you do?

1768
01:07:11,264 --> 01:07:11,264
- Mr. Parker, our
photographer, Mr. Hamilton,

1769
01:07:12,254 --> 01:07:12,254
head of our art department.

1770
01:07:13,218 --> 01:07:13,218
- How do you do?

1771
01:07:14,273 --> 01:07:14,273
- Gentlemen, this is
our little Marcy.

1772
01:07:16,276 --> 01:07:16,276
Won't you sit right
down over here?

1773
01:07:18,271 --> 01:07:18,271
- We've certainly got to
hand it to you, Miss Lewis.

1774
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:19,250
- You do?

1775
01:07:20,242 --> 01:07:20,242
- It's all right, Marcy.

1776
01:07:21,226 --> 01:07:21,226
We know all about it.

1777
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:22,270
We've heard from Bellemy.

1778
01:07:24,213 --> 01:07:24,213
- Oh, how is he?

1779
01:07:27,268 --> 01:07:27,268
- He's fine, like a kid,
full of enthusiasm.

1780
01:07:29,279 --> 01:07:29,279
He's got the greatest
advertising campaign

1781
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:31,250
in the history of
his company lined up.

1782
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:32,280
- Well, that's wonderful, Mike.

1783
01:07:34,263 --> 01:07:34,263
Is it yours?

1784
01:07:35,223 --> 01:07:35,223
- No, yours.

1785
01:07:39,279 --> 01:07:39,279
- Mine?

1786
01:07:41,259 --> 01:07:41,259
- Didn't you write him
a letter giving him

1787
01:07:44,259 --> 01:07:44,259
an idea for gardenia soap?

1788
01:07:46,245 --> 01:07:46,245
- Oh, yes.

1789
01:07:47,302 --> 01:07:47,302
Remember that night we
were dancing in Chicago,

1790
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:49,220
you told me to write him a note?

1791
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:49,270
- Uh-huh.

1792
01:07:50,279 --> 01:07:50,279
- Well, I did.

1793
01:07:51,237 --> 01:07:51,237
- You did?

1794
01:07:52,278 --> 01:07:52,278
- Mm-hm.

1795
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:54,220
Did he like it?

1796
01:07:57,267 --> 01:07:57,267
- He's insane about it, and I
use the word "insane" advisedly.

1797
01:07:59,291 --> 01:07:59,291
He's talking bonuses.

1798
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:04,229
- CJ, don't let's
forget to call Bellemy.

1799
01:08:04,264 --> 01:08:04,264
this morning listening to
him rave about this idea,

1800
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:06,300
and I don't even
know what it's about.

1801
01:08:08,305 --> 01:08:08,305
- Well, it's a wonderful idea.

1802
01:08:09,292 --> 01:08:09,292
- It is?

1803
01:08:13,265 --> 01:08:13,265
- Um, Miss Lewis, could you be
a little bit more specific?

1804
01:08:14,288 --> 01:08:14,288
- Well, of course.

1805
01:08:16,233 --> 01:08:16,233
- That would be nice.

1806
01:08:17,286 --> 01:08:17,286
- Well, the idea is this.

1807
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:19,261
You've seen pictures of
actresses, socialites,

1808
01:08:21,253 --> 01:08:21,253
and athletes endorsing
different things,

1809
01:08:24,218 --> 01:08:24,218
and I was thinking, why
not airline stewardesses?

1810
01:08:25,251 --> 01:08:25,251
I know people are
interested in us

1811
01:08:27,282 --> 01:08:27,282
because they're always
asking me about our work,

1812
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:29,271
and if you use pictures
of airline stewardesses

1813
01:08:31,295 --> 01:08:31,295
all over the world, it
would tie in with the idea

1814
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:34,210
that Gardenia soap is the
same under all conditions.

1815
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:40,282
You like it?

1816
01:08:42,278 --> 01:08:42,278
- Like it?

1817
01:08:43,228 --> 01:08:43,228
Like it?

1818
01:08:44,277 --> 01:08:44,277
Honey, I think it's great.

1819
01:08:45,292 --> 01:08:45,292
It's just great.

1820
01:08:46,243 --> 01:08:46,243
- It's fine.

1821
01:08:48,221 --> 01:08:48,221
- Osgood, I want you to
get an exclusive tie-up

1822
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:48,300
with the airline.

1823
01:08:50,273 --> 01:08:50,273
We're going to use 24
sheets all over the country.

1824
01:08:51,223 --> 01:08:51,223
- Right.

1825
01:08:54,208 --> 01:08:54,208
- Hamilton, give me a layout for
a series of radio commercials.

1826
01:08:55,228 --> 01:08:55,228
Use the marriage angle.

1827
01:08:56,291 --> 01:08:56,291
Airline stewardesses
have gotten married.

1828
01:08:57,294 --> 01:08:57,294
- Oh, but they don't fly
after they're married.

1829
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:58,300
- Then strike the marriage angle.

1830
01:08:59,288 --> 01:08:59,288
We'll keep them single.

1831
01:09:00,228 --> 01:09:01,263
- Mike!

1832
01:09:01,298 --> 01:09:01,298
- Yes, good idea.

1833
01:09:03,282 --> 01:09:03,282
- Parker, I want you to
use a different stewardess

1834
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:04,273
for every layout.

1835
01:09:06,243 --> 01:09:06,243
We'll make it a Gardenia
girl of the month.

1836
01:09:08,224 --> 01:09:08,224
get your girls to
start shooting art.

1837
01:09:10,207 --> 01:09:10,207
We could use backgrounds
all over the world,

1838
01:09:11,291 --> 01:09:11,291
but wherever they are,
they're using Gardenia soap.

1839
01:09:12,283 --> 01:09:12,283
Got it?

1840
01:09:14,202 --> 01:09:14,202
- Got it.

1841
01:09:14,297 --> 01:09:14,297
One thing.

1842
01:09:16,211 --> 01:09:16,211
- Yeah?

1843
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:17,290
- Who's going to be our
first Gardenia girl?

01:23:42,128 --> 01:23:42,128
Stop it!

2278
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:44,170
Stop it!

2279
01:23:46,133 --> 01:23:46,133
WOMAN (OFFSCREEN):
Photographer's studio scene

2280
01:23:48,166 --> 01:23:48,166
of Sunset Strip brawl.

2281
01:23:48,216 --> 01:23:48,216
Hm.

2282
01:23:55,189 --> 01:23:55,189
- Well, this ought to sell
a lot of Gardenia soap.

2283
01:23:56,199 --> 01:23:56,199
- Boy, what a brawl.

2284
01:23:58,142 --> 01:23:58,142
- How can you joke about this?

2285
01:24:00,206 --> 01:25:00,206
wouldn't have gone down
there in the first place,

2286
01:24:01,206 --> 01:24:04,115
Mike Lawrence has
been disqualified

2287
01:24:04,150 --> 01:24:04,150
for his fellowship, Mike
Jamison has been grounded,

2288
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:06,159
and Mike Tracy lost
the Bellamy account

2289
01:24:07,201 --> 01:24:07,201
and I've been suspended.

2290
01:24:09,137 --> 01:24:09,137
- I'd say you've had a busy day.

2291
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:11,150
- But honey, worrying about
it isn't going to help.

2292
01:24:13,142 --> 01:24:13,142
- I'd just like to unscramble it.

2293
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:14,208
- Darling, if you don't
mind a suggestion,

2294
01:24:17,175 --> 01:24:17,175
why don't you let them all alone
before you get them all hanged?

2295
01:24:18,198 --> 01:24:18,198
- Hm.

2296
01:24:21,159 --> 01:24:21,159
- Anyway, one good thing's
come out of all this.

2297
01:24:22,156 --> 01:24:22,156
- What?

2298
01:24:24,148 --> 01:24:24,148
- Roger saw the
paper this morning.

2299
01:24:27,153 --> 01:24:27,153
He's informed me that we're
to be married right away.

2300
01:24:28,148 --> 01:24:28,148
- Oh, he woke up.

2301
01:24:29,186 --> 01:24:29,186
- I'm glad that's settled.

2302
01:24:30,205 --> 01:24:30,205
- That's wonderful.

2303
01:24:33,207 --> 01:24:33,207
- Oh, I'm so happy for you, Jan.

2304
01:24:35,159 --> 01:24:35,159
Just great.

2305
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:37,120
- Anybody want some more coffee?

2306
01:24:38,119 --> 01:24:38,119
- Mm.

2307
01:24:39,135 --> 01:24:39,135
- Alice?

2308
01:24:40,121 --> 01:24:40,121
Hold your cups up, please.

2309
01:24:44,147 --> 01:24:44,147
Kathy?

2310
01:24:46,175 --> 01:24:46,175
KATHY (OFFSCREEN):
Mm-hm, a little.

2311
01:24:48,164 --> 01:24:48,164
JAN (OFFSCREEN):
How's the toast?

2312
01:24:51,189 --> 01:24:51,189
- I realize the fellowship
depends partly on character,

2313
01:24:54,184 --> 01:24:54,184
but Mike has one of the finest
characters I've ever known,

2314
01:24:57,206 --> 01:24:57,206
Dr. Hardy, and that's
what makes me feel so bad.

2315
01:24:59,143 --> 01:24:59,143
If he didn't care
about people, he

2316
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:02,161
I issued the order myself.

2317
01:25:02,196 --> 01:25:02,196
and he wouldn't be
in all this trouble.

2318
01:25:05,159 --> 01:25:05,159
If he didn't care about people,
what kind of a scientist

2319
01:25:06,121 --> 01:25:06,121
would he make?

2320
01:25:07,208 --> 01:25:07,208
Why would he want to
devote his entire life

2321
01:25:11,202 --> 01:25:11,202
to working and teaching to
make life easier for all of us?

2322
01:25:15,171 --> 01:25:15,171
Please, don't take this
opportunity away from him.

2323
01:25:16,164 --> 01:25:16,164
It wasn't his fault.

2324
01:25:18,170 --> 01:25:18,170
He had no idea
this would happen.

2325
01:25:20,206 --> 01:25:20,206
It isn't fair for you to
take your account away

2326
01:25:22,156 --> 01:25:22,156
from Mike because of this.

2327
01:25:24,109 --> 01:25:24,109
He's impulsive.

2328
01:25:25,172 --> 01:25:25,172
That's what makes him a creator.

2329
01:25:27,147 --> 01:25:27,147
If it weren't for that,
he wouldn't get ideas

2330
01:25:29,165 --> 01:25:29,165
like the Gardenia
girl campaign, which

2331
01:25:31,190 --> 01:25:31,190
is still great advertising.

2332
01:25:33,150 --> 01:25:33,150
I don't have to tell
you how lucky you

2333
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:35,170
are to have a man like
Mike working for you.

2334
01:25:36,145 --> 01:25:36,145
Look at his record.

2335
01:25:40,110 --> 01:25:40,110
You can't dismiss that.

2336
01:25:43,152 --> 01:25:43,152
Mr. Smith, Mike Jamison
is the best pilot

2337
01:25:45,134 --> 01:25:45,134
you have for the simple
reason that flying

2338
01:25:47,112 --> 01:25:47,112
is the most important
thing in his life.

2339
01:25:49,157 --> 01:25:49,157
If he weren't adventurous
and courageous, he-

2340
01:25:52,124 --> 01:25:52,124
he just wouldn't be
Captain Mike Jamison.

2341
01:25:55,135 --> 01:25:55,135
- This used to be such a quiet
business before you came along,

2342
01:25:56,141 --> 01:25:56,141
Marcy.

2343
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:57,160
- I'm on suspension.

2344
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:58,120
- I know.

2345
01:26:00,119 --> 01:26:02,135
- This is important.

2346
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:02,170
It's none of my
business, but, um,

2347
01:26:05,110 --> 01:26:05,110
what were you doing
in that sarong?

2348
01:26:06,163 --> 01:26:06,163
- Posing for the Gardenia ad.

2349
01:26:07,161 --> 01:26:07,161
- Oh, I wondered.

2350
01:26:09,109 --> 01:26:09,109
- Then the I started
and I had to-

2351
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:11,120
- Yes, I read the rest of it.

2352
01:26:14,196 --> 01:26:14,196
Look, if you can find something
a little less colorful to wear,

2353
01:26:18,139 --> 01:26:18,139
like our regulation
uniform, you and Mike

2354
01:26:20,166 --> 01:26:20,166
can go back to,
um, cloud hopping.

2355
01:26:23,115 --> 01:26:23,115
- Um, what do you mean
by cloud hopping?

2356
01:26:24,192 --> 01:26:24,192
- Well, that's up to Marcy.

2357
01:26:27,126 --> 01:26:27,126
- Oh, she- she and Mike
were getting along very well

2358
01:26:27,202 --> 01:26:27,202
on the ground.

2359
01:26:30,126 --> 01:26:30,126
- No, that's not what she needs.

2360
01:26:33,171 --> 01:26:33,171
She needs a guy like Mike
who's creative, impulsive.

2361
01:26:35,112 --> 01:26:35,112
She told me so herself.

2362
01:26:38,105 --> 01:26:38,105
- Mr. Bellamy, you
just heard Miss Lewis.

2363
01:26:40,109 --> 01:26:40,109
She admires a man of courage.

2364
01:26:41,147 --> 01:26:41,147
- Oh no, she admires
a man of character.

2365
01:26:42,177 --> 01:26:42,177
- Now, wait a minute.

2366
01:26:43,191 --> 01:26:43,191
[ARGUING]

2367
01:26:44,187 --> 01:26:44,187
- I have to disagree with you.

2368
01:26:45,136 --> 01:26:45,136
- Gentlemen.

2369
01:26:48,134 --> 01:26:48,134
- She needs a pioneering spirit,
a man who will direct her-

ANNOUNCER (OFFSCREEN):

Four, the Mercury, for
Chicago and New York

now boarding at American-

2373
01:26:57,111 --> 01:26:57,111

2374
01:26:58,128 --> 01:26:58,128
- Hi, Mike.
- Oh, now wait a minute.

2375
01:26:59,112 --> 01:26:59,112
- No, I want to talk to you.
- I've got to get aboard.

2376
01:26:59,156 --> 01:26:59,156
I-

2377
01:27:01,117 --> 01:27:01,117
- Mike, I have to leave.

2378
01:27:02,137 --> 01:27:02,137
- Look, not until
I've talked to you.

2379
01:27:03,139 --> 01:27:03,139
- That's my flight.
- Look, Marcy.

2380
01:27:04,175 --> 01:27:04,175
I- I don't know how
to say this, but-

2381
01:27:05,126 --> 01:27:05,126
- Marcy!

2382
01:27:06,187 --> 01:27:06,187
Marcy, I- I've got
to talk to you alone.

2383
01:27:07,168 --> 01:27:07,168
Excuse us, please.
- Now just a minute.

2384
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:09,130
- Look, I've got to say
this before you leave.

2385
01:27:10,099 --> 01:27:10,099
- If you don't mind.

2386
01:27:11,099 --> 01:27:11,099
- Jan told me you were leaving.

2387
01:27:11,148 --> 01:27:11,148
- I am.

2388
01:27:13,166 --> 01:27:13,166
- This is important.

2389
01:27:17,168 --> 01:27:17,168
- Well, I'm- I'm
glad I got here.

2390
01:27:18,164 --> 01:27:18,164
- Well, I have-

2391
01:27:19,172 --> 01:27:19,172
- Look, Marcy.

2392
01:27:21,175 --> 01:27:21,175
I never thought I'd have to
propose in front of a crowd,

2393
01:27:26,109 --> 01:27:26,109
but Marcy, will you marry me?

2394
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:27,110
- Oh, Mike.

2395
01:27:29,098 --> 01:27:29,098
Remember what we said about
the world being filled

2396
01:27:32,103 --> 01:27:32,103
with wonderful people
talking strange languages?

2397
01:27:33,139 --> 01:27:33,139
We could listen
to them together.

2398
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:37,130
We've got the whole
world to fly around in.

2399
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:39,170
We could be awfully
happy, Marcy.

2400
01:27:40,193 --> 01:27:40,193
I-

2401
01:27:42,134 --> 01:27:42,134
- Marcy.

2402
01:27:44,136 --> 01:27:44,136
Marcy, that's wrong for you.

2403
01:27:46,102 --> 01:27:46,102
You and I are not
going to watch history.

2404
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:47,110
We're going to make it.

2405
01:27:49,129 --> 01:27:49,129
It's ideas that move
the world, Marcy.

2406
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:52,166
That's what your excitement
is, the same as mine.

2407
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:55,180
Besides, those six
kids need a father.

MIKE (OFFSCREEN): Marcy!

2409

- Yes, Mike?

01:28:00,168 --> 01:28:08,121
- He lights up.

2411
01:28:08,156 --> 01:28:08,156
- There's not much
more I can say.

2412
01:28:11,184 --> 01:28:11,184
All this sounds
pretty wonderful.

2413
01:28:15,184 --> 01:28:15,184
- Then why are you here, Mike?

2414
01:28:17,103 --> 01:28:17,103
- Because I love you.

2415
01:28:26,151 --> 01:28:26,151
Oh, Marcy.

2416
01:28:28,127 --> 01:28:28,127
You don't have to say anything.

2417
01:28:30,093 --> 01:28:30,093
Being married to
a teacher wouldn't

2418
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:31,180
be very exciting, and-

2419
01:28:35,096 --> 01:28:35,096
- Oh, you're going
to be surprised.

2420
01:28:36,177 --> 01:28:36,177
- What?

2421
01:28:39,142 --> 01:28:39,142

01:28:42,174 --> 01:28:42,174

Mike.

01:28:58,161 --> 01:28:58,161
It's simple bioluminescence.

01:28:59,179 --> 01:28:59,179
- It's what?

2435
01:29:01,141 --> 01:29:01,141
- Lights up?

2436
01:29:03,097 --> 01:29:03,097
- Goodbye.

2437
01:29:03,179 --> 01:29:03,179
- So long.

2438
01:29:04,161 --> 01:29:04,161
- Bye, Marcy.

2439
01:29:09,179 --> 01:29:09,179
- Marcy, here's your
clearance slip.

2440
01:29:11,162 --> 01:29:11,162
Hey, that's an extra passenger.

2441
01:29:12,111 --> 01:29:12,111
- He's with me.

2442
01:29:12,161 --> 01:29:12,161
- I'm with her.

2443
01:29:14,144 --> 01:29:14,144
- Hey Marcy, you can't do that.

2444
01:29:15,171 --> 01:29:15,171
It's against the rules.

2445
01:29:16,121 --> 01:29:16,171
Marcy!

2446
01:29:21,130 --> 01:29:21,130
She can't do that.

2447
01:29:22,152 --> 01:29:22,152
It's against the rules.

2448
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:23,180
- Rules weren't made for Marcy.

2449
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:26,100
- They sure weren't.

2450
01:29:28,121 --> 01:29:28,121
- Well, we got each other.

2451
01:29:28,172 --> 01:29:28,172
- Yeah.

2452
01:29:38,103 --> 01:32:00,124
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2453
01:32:00,159 --> 01:32:40,113
that you have to
be your own boss

2454
01:32:40,148 --> 01:32:40,148
- and I have repeat
customers all year round.

2455
01:32:48,103 --> 01:32:48,103
My gross sales for a whole
year were close to $300,000.

2456
01:32:50,126 --> 01:32:50,126
SMC definitely changed my life.

2457
01:32:52,085 --> 01:32:52,085
I feel free.

2458
01:32:54,117 --> 01:32:54,117
I don't have to
work for somebody.

2459
01:32:56,106 --> 01:32:56,106
I don't have that pressure.

2460
01:32:58,151 --> 01:32:58,151
I make a lot of
money and I find out

2461
01:33:00,093 --> 01:33:04,086
to help you succeed.

2462
01:33:04,121 --> 01:33:04,121
and go out there and have fun.

2463
01:33:06,094 --> 01:33:06,094
I feel really good about that.

2464
01:33:13,121 --> 01:33:13,121
- SMC gives you the
best of all worlds.

2465
01:33:17,124 --> 01:33:17,124
You can start a business of your
own, part time or full time,

2466
01:33:21,093 --> 01:33:21,093
from the comfort of your home
or office or retail outlet,

2467
01:33:24,119 --> 01:33:24,119
or at festivals and swap meets
with an initial investment

2468
01:33:27,072 --> 01:33:27,072
as low as $25 or less.

2469
01:33:30,112 --> 01:33:30,112
Best of all, it's your business,
but it's awfully comforting

2470
01:33:32,139 --> 01:33:32,139
to know you don't
have to go it alone,

2471
01:33:35,074 --> 01:33:35,074
that you have the full
support and resources

2472
01:33:37,068 --> 01:33:37,068
of a multi-million
dollar company

2473
01:33:40,068 --> 01:33:40,068
with more than 50 years of
experience helping people

2474
01:33:41,159 --> 01:33:41,159
like you start
their own business.

2475
01:33:46,098 --> 01:33:46,098
- I think anybody
going into business

2476
01:33:48,117 --> 01:33:48,117
for the first time needs help.

2477
01:33:50,093 --> 01:33:50,093
More than anything
else, they need help,

2478
01:33:54,123 --> 01:33:54,123
and SMC is committed to giving
them all the help that we can.

2479
01:33:56,071 --> 01:33:56,071
So we give you a
personal business coach

2480
01:33:59,080 --> 01:33:59,080
for your first 60 days,
and it's that coach's job

2481
01:34:01,055 --> 01:34:02,058
I mean, there were no
income coming any place,

2482
01:34:02,093 --> 01:34:02,093
They're going to help you figure
out what the best marketing

2483
01:34:04,111 --> 01:34:04,111
program is for you, they're
going to help you figure out

2484
01:34:05,138 --> 01:34:05,138
which products you
should be selling,

2485
01:34:07,103 --> 01:34:07,103
how much you should charge.

2486
01:34:10,072 --> 01:34:10,072
Their job is to make sure
that in your first 60 days,

2487
01:34:11,141 --> 01:34:11,141
you're putting money
in your pocket.

2488
01:34:14,114 --> 01:34:14,114
A lot of people who have
been really successful at SMC

2489
01:34:16,126 --> 01:34:16,126
have never sold anything
before in their life.

2490
01:34:18,097 --> 01:34:18,097
In fact, they'll tell
you that they still

2491
01:34:21,093 --> 01:34:21,093
don't know how to sell, and
yet they're selling every day.

2492
01:34:22,112 --> 01:34:22,112
It's because
really, they tell me

2493
01:34:24,066 --> 01:34:24,066
the products sell themselves.

2494
01:34:26,150 --> 01:34:26,150
They just show their catalogs
or they show their samples,

2495
01:34:27,150 --> 01:34:27,150
and they get orders.

2496
01:34:30,057 --> 01:34:30,057
There's really not a
lot of selling involved.

2497
01:34:33,139 --> 01:34:33,139
Plus, we have marketing programs
that run the gamut from swap

2498
01:34:36,155 --> 01:34:36,155
meets and flea markets
to internet sales,

2499
01:34:38,136 --> 01:34:38,136
mail order sales,
where you might never,

2500
01:34:40,117 --> 01:34:40,117
ever meet any of your customers.

2501
01:34:43,123 --> 01:34:43,123
I think it's everybody's
dream to be able to make money

2502
01:34:46,084 --> 01:34:46,084
at home, have time to
spend with the family,

2503
01:34:47,125 --> 01:34:47,125
really have control
of your life,

2504
01:34:52,133 --> 01:34:52,133
and SMC has really allowed a lot
of our members to do just that.

2505
01:34:55,079 --> 01:34:55,079
- I worked 27 years
for this company

2506
01:34:57,085 --> 01:34:57,085
and had the rug pulled
out from under us.

2507
01:34:58,109 --> 01:34:58,109
The whole plant went down.

2508
01:35:01,082 --> 01:35:01,601
- SMC shows you nearly
a dozen different ways

2509
01:35:01,636 --> 01:35:02,121
so I just thought it
would be good to help

2510
01:35:04,082 --> 01:35:04,082
my wife in her business, then.

2511
01:35:08,112 --> 01:35:08,112
- Our goal became to
survive, but the coffee shop

2512
01:35:10,103 --> 01:35:10,103
wasn't going to
make enough money.

2513
01:35:13,151 --> 01:35:13,151
You just can't sell
enough cups of coffee

2514
01:35:15,121 --> 01:35:15,121
to support two people.

2515
01:35:18,099 --> 01:35:18,099
- Anyway, I contacted
SMC, and that's

2516
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:20,064
how we got into the business.

2517
01:35:23,082 --> 01:35:23,082
- With SMC, the amount
that we put into it,

2518
01:35:24,129 --> 01:35:24,129
we saw it come back quickly.

2519
01:35:27,089 --> 01:35:27,089
Sold a few items, saw that
money come back, now we

2520
01:35:31,058 --> 01:35:31,058
have more cash, put it out
again, and we're making money.

2521
01:35:34,096 --> 01:35:34,096
The customers love the
quality, and they always

2522
01:35:37,139 --> 01:35:37,139
comment on our prices,
how good the prices are,

2523
01:35:40,123 --> 01:35:40,123
and they keep coming
back very often.

2524
01:35:43,088 --> 01:35:43,088
- It's not hard to
sell SMC because there

2525
01:35:46,139 --> 01:35:46,139
is such a great variety
of items that they offer

2526
01:35:48,088 --> 01:35:48,088
and it's good quality.

2527
01:35:50,092 --> 01:35:50,092
The merchandise sells itself.

2528
01:35:53,056 --> 01:35:53,056
SMC was a great
thing to get into.

2529
01:35:53,139 --> 01:35:53,139
I love my job.

2530
01:36:03,097 --> 01:36:03,097
to make money with
small business,

2531
01:36:03,108 --> 01:36:04,603
You can order in huge
quantities or as little as-

2532
01:36:04,638 --> 01:36:06,099
each detailed with step
by step instructions.

2533
01:36:08,056 --> 01:36:08,056
They support you
with rock bottom,

2534
01:36:11,136 --> 01:36:11,136
below wholesale prices on
more than 3,000 high profit,

2535
01:36:15,084 --> 01:36:15,084
high demand products selected
by an expert buying team.

2536
01:36:17,085 --> 01:36:17,085
Take this charming
birdhouse, for example,

2537
01:36:19,101 --> 01:36:19,101
with a delightful
Noah's Ark design that

2538
01:36:21,106 --> 01:36:21,106
welcomes all feathered
friends aboard.

2539
01:36:24,091 --> 01:36:24,091
This high demand item
retails for $24.95,

2540
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:28,100
but your cost with
SMC is only $8.30.

2541
01:36:32,091 --> 01:36:32,091
That's a profit of more than
$16 on every one you sell.

2542
01:36:35,106 --> 01:36:35,106
Another hot selling item is
this high quality tool set,

2543
01:36:39,076 --> 01:36:39,076
135 piece handyman's
helper, and a must for every

2544
01:36:41,053 --> 01:36:41,053
fix it project around the house.

2545
01:36:42,128 --> 01:36:42,128
It'll help you build
up profits too,

2546
01:36:48,094 --> 01:36:48,094
because it retails for $69.95,
but your cost is just $23.30.

2547
01:36:50,137 --> 01:36:50,137
So with a margin
of over $46, you

2548
01:36:53,061 --> 01:36:53,061
triple your money with each one.

2549
01:36:55,121 --> 01:36:55,121
SMC prices are so
low, many members

2550
01:36:57,142 --> 01:36:57,142
earn a nice income by
simply providing products

2551
01:36:59,118 --> 01:36:59,118
to other wholesalers.
