00:02:02,082 --> 00:02:03,356
Hi Frankie.

2
00:02:04,322 --> 00:02:06,040
Hello.

3
00:02:14,922 --> 00:02:16,595
Get in here.

4
00:02:37,895 --> 00:02:40,615
Nothing like that first drink of the day

5
00:02:42,775 --> 00:02:45,688
Go on, drink up! Enjoy

6
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:48,553
They tell me, you're quite a dancer?

7
00:02:48,554 --> 00:02:50,628
Well how about a dance anyway?
No? 

8
00:03:17,482 --> 00:03:20,953
Hey give them back. What's the big idea?

9
00:03:22,443 --> 00:03:24,638
Frankie...

10
00:03:25,242 --> 00:03:28,041
Frankie, when did you get back?
How are you?

11
00:03:28,562 --> 00:03:30,554
You all right? You know.....

12
00:03:31,683 --> 00:03:34,594
- The monkey is gone.
- Let me look at you.

13
00:03:37,163 --> 00:03:40,712
- Not even a postie card.
- You can't read anyway.

14
00:03:41,968 --> 00:03:44,933
- You're good at drawing pictures.
- Oh, you goof-ball.

15
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:46,934
How's the lost dog business?

16
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:51,011
As soon as they see me walking around,
people start locking up their mutts.

17
00:03:51,342 --> 00:03:55,300
I tell you folks just don't have that
trust in their fellow man anymore.

18
00:03:57,782 --> 00:04:00,979
- Hey Antic, look who's out.
- Frankie!

19
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:06,739
- You all right? Good kid.
- Enough already, buy me a drink.

20
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:10,627
- Look what the cat dragged in.
- Frankie!

21
00:04:11,035 --> 00:04:13,704
You've been gone so long, I thought
maybe you'd been made warden.

22
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:16,064
- Well you're looking good.
- Put on 6 pounds.

23
00:04:16,355 --> 00:04:16,992
6 pounds!

24
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:19,859
He's been gone so long, I thought
maybe he'd been made warden.

25
00:04:20,115 --> 00:04:23,027
- How was it down there Frankie?
- Greatest place you've ever seen.

26
00:04:24,234 --> 00:04:26,533
I知 telling ya, ball games, great food.

27
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:28,831
I even learned how to play the drums.

28
00:04:29,075 --> 00:04:31,107
You make it sound as
if I missed something by

29
00:04:31,108 --> 00:04:33,227
not going to jail years
ago. It's a prison, no?

30
00:04:33,595 --> 00:04:36,560
More of a hospital kind.
Let me show you something.

31
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:39,761
Ah, Federal Pens is always best.
Ask anybody.

32
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:43,521
He's been gone so long, I
think he's been made warden.

33
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:47,479
Ever see anything so pretty.

34
00:04:47,608 --> 00:04:49,997
- Don't touch!
- Hey, how'd you sneak them out Frankie?

35
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,161
- Them guys gave them to me in the band.
- They let you have a band?

36
00:04:53,448 --> 00:04:56,361
Yeah, I was in it. They chipped in
and bought me these when I left.

37
00:04:57,969 --> 00:05:02,139
Long time. How was it there? Bad?

38
00:05:05,742 --> 00:05:10,213
- lt wasn't bad.
- Six months. You could hardly wait, I bet?

39
00:05:12,781 --> 00:05:17,412
- Come over to my place
- No thanks.

40
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,854
You broke? Now ain't you being stupid?
It's for free.

41
00:05:21,702 --> 00:05:24,262
I don't need it, that's all. I kicked it.

42
00:05:27,549 --> 00:05:29,193
Oh, kicked it?

43
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:33,304
- One of them.
- I mean it.

44
00:05:33,436 --> 00:05:35,073
Sure

45
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:38,787
I'lll be around.

46
00:05:43,675 --> 00:05:47,554
Frankie, don't do it. Don't start
up with that peddler again.

47
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:51,652
I'd rather chop my arm off,
before I'd let him touch it.

48
00:05:52,716 --> 00:05:55,481
this Dr. Lennick who took care
of me down at the hospital,

49
00:05:55,482 --> 00:05:57,683
real good guy he told
me at least 10 times....

50
00:05:58,128 --> 00:06:00,178
He told me Frankie, you get out of here

51
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:02,281
and take one fix, you're hooked again.

52
00:06:05,008 --> 00:06:06,681
Don't worry about me buddy boy

53
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:11,127
Let's get out of here. Thanks Antic.

54
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:16,119
Take care of the dog for me. I've
got a customer coming to get it.

55
00:06:23,702 --> 00:06:25,259
- Don't let him give you no gas.

56
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,861
- Him? I ain't going to be around
here long enough to let him bother me.

57
00:06:28,862 --> 00:06:29,175
- Don't let him give you no gas.

58
00:06:29,176 --> 00:06:29,900
- Him? I ain't going to be around
here long enough to let him bother me.

59
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:33,531
- I知 going to get me a job in a big-name band.
- You're kidding?

60
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,679
What do you think I stretching
my wrist for buddy-o?

61
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,301
The guy that teaches drumming
down there, says I'm a natural.

62
00:06:39,662 --> 00:06:42,176
I can't miss he says.
Arm's made of pure gold.

63
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:44,174
You mean a job winding these drums?

64
00:06:44,662 --> 00:06:48,963
- I've got everything planned too.
Going to call myself Jack Duvall.

65
00:06:48,964 --> 00:06:52,828
- Probably I ain't going to see
you around so much then, huh?

66
00:06:53,836 --> 00:06:55,372
Maybe I can set something up for you.

67
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,033
Carrying the instruments or something.

68
00:06:58,076 --> 00:07:00,351
- Traveling around the country high
-type night clubs.

69
00:07:00,352 --> 00:07:02,832
- How does that sound to you?
- When is it going to be, when??

70
00:07:03,236 --> 00:07:05,924
Right away, today. I知 the kind
of guy boy that when I move,

71
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,435
watch my smoke. But I知 going
to need some good clothes.

72
00:07:08,836 --> 00:07:11,783
- Well you go on up. I知
going to find you some.

73
00:07:11,784 --> 00:07:13,167
- Yeah, yeah, size 39.

74
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:14,684
- 39.
- Stripes.

75
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,442
Something nice.

76
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:29,808
You stop that noise! You and your
husband or I throw you both out.

77
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:36,481
Who is landlord? Me! You do as I say.

78
00:07:36,876 --> 00:07:39,829
Your mother's eye socks, I do like you say!

79
00:07:41,157 --> 00:07:44,069
Frankie...

80
00:07:44,437 --> 00:07:48,589
You look great! How're ya
feeling Frankie? I mean....

81
00:07:49,117 --> 00:07:51,790
- Fine, fine, just
fine. Hi ya landlord.

82
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:55,636
- She and husband fight all
the time. Holler throw things!

83
00:07:56,637 --> 00:07:57,667
- Nothing changes.

84
00:07:57,668 --> 00:08:00,870
- This is respectable house,
and I am respectable man!

85
00:08:01,318 --> 00:08:04,282
Respectable my eye! Go on get out,
you're late for the parole board.

86
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,539
Frankie...

87
00:08:36,825 --> 00:08:39,736
You're home.

88
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:44,456
Oh Frankie, I love you so much!

89
00:08:47,864 --> 00:08:50,776
I've missed you so.

90
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,550
I've been so lonely Frankie, without you.

91
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:04,190
- I've been so lonely without you.
- Sssh, stop crying.

92
00:09:05,718 --> 00:09:07,993
Let me look at you.

93
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,710
- My eyes are going to be all red.
- No, you look fine.

94
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:17,707
- ls the cold sore gone?
- Yeah, you look real good.

95
00:09:25,444 --> 00:09:30,211
I've had this cold sore, and I wanted to
look real nice for you when you came back.

96
00:09:30,212 --> 00:09:33,786
I was afraid that it wouldn't
be gone, so I put this cream on.

97
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:40,436
Everything is going to be all right..

98
00:09:42,444 --> 00:09:46,606
Oh, you didn't see. Look, Vi
got the cake by the bakery,

99
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:50,256
but the sign I made. Sort
of like a welcome home.

100
00:09:54,098 --> 00:09:56,009
Gee, it's like a real party or something.

101
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,134
Real nice.

102
00:10:01,138 --> 00:10:04,050
- How are you Frankie?
- I知 clean.

103
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:06,095
Sure?

104
00:10:07,058 --> 00:10:09,970
- I kicked it for keeps.
- Did it hurt?

105
00:10:11,818 --> 00:10:13,496
How was it there for you?

106
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:16,186
They treated me fine down there. 

107
00:10:16,187 --> 00:10:18,223
There was this doctor, Dr. Lennex,
he was real good to me.

108
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:25,142
Frankie! Did you miss me?

109
00:10:26,511 --> 00:10:29,822
Of course I missed you. What
kind of silly question is that?

110
00:10:31,671 --> 00:10:35,061
Of course I missed you. Honest, no kidding.

111
00:10:37,311 --> 00:10:41,153
- What have you got there?
- You'll see. Oh, I brought you something.

112
00:10:45,804 --> 00:10:47,286
- Oh, it an exquisite thing.

113
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:50,514
- You like it? I made it myself,
out of cigarette wrappers.

114
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:55,677
It's just an exquisite thing, that's all.
- You made it? Yeah.

115
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,782
Yeah, for a hobby like.
You see part of the cure,

116
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,438
was to keep yourself busy,
doing things you enjoy

117
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:05,238
Like for instance, I wanted
to learn to drum and music.

118
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:07,333
And Dr. Lennex got
them to help me do it.

119
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:12,674
During the day I was kept busy
enough, but during the night I'd

120
00:11:12,675 --> 00:11:15,297
get restless and I wanted to
keep my mind of the craving.

121
00:11:15,979 --> 00:11:17,889
I made that.

122
00:11:19,018 --> 00:11:21,931
- There's something important I've got to tell you.
- What?

123
00:11:22,658 --> 00:11:24,808
I forget right now.

124
00:11:26,778 --> 00:11:28,097
A whistle?

125
00:11:28,538 --> 00:11:30,989
I was scared sometimes being alone.

126
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,540
So I got it for me and I should blow
for her when I wanted her

127
00:11:34,672 --> 00:11:36,583
Go on, you were telling me.

128
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:39,888
The first thing you
do when you get there,

129
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:41,344
is you talk to a doctor
for about 2 hours.

130
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,413
I know! I know what it is. I
know what I wanted to tell you.

131
00:11:44,632 --> 00:11:46,758
I took me to this movie
and the girl's kid brother

132
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,803
had a friend and who do
you think he looked like?

133
00:11:49,311 --> 00:11:50,791
- Who?
- You!

134
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:55,789
That was a good movie. 
Stage show was real good too.

135
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,118
We owe thy 80 cents for
the movie, I was broke.

136
00:11:58,119 --> 00:11:59,604
We owe her for the cake too.

137
00:12:01,365 --> 00:12:05,154
How come you didn't have any money?
Swrick didn't kick in regular?

138
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:08,244
- No.
- Well, he was suppose to.

139
00:12:09,365 --> 00:12:12,277
lt was his joint they raided, not mine.
I was just the dealer.

140
00:12:13,286 --> 00:12:15,436
I kept my mouth shut and took the rap.

141
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:20,869
- If he didn't send 50 a
month regular, how much did he?

142
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,358
- Well he sent 50, but not regular

143
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,334
See I had to kick in for me sometimes.

144
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:31,771
She took good care of you?
You had fun with her?

145
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:35,491
Yeah.....but not like when you're here.

146
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:40,069
lt was terrible being
alone Frankie... and my

147
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,531
legs when they hurt, she
don't massage like you.

148
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:50,806
- What do they say by the clinic?
- I stopped going by that goofy clinic.

149
00:12:51,632 --> 00:12:53,724
The clinic must know
what right. You got to

150
00:12:53,725 --> 00:12:55,864
start the clinic again.
You got to get well.

151
00:12:56,912 --> 00:12:59,825
I dreamed that this new doctor
around the corner, he cured me.

152
00:12:59,826 --> 00:13:02,783
I'd have gone to him already,
but he ain't free like the clinic.

153
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:06,624
But now you're back making
money again, and I'lll go.

154
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:10,824
I知 finished with Shrika. I
won't deal for him no more.

155
00:13:11,913 --> 00:13:13,710
But you always deal. You're a dealer.

156
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:15,701
You're the best dealer in the business.

157
00:13:16,246 --> 00:13:18,675
No more. I知 a drummer now..

158
00:13:21,005 --> 00:13:24,742
- Don't make jokes Frankie. I
never know when you're making jokes.

159
00:13:24,743 --> 00:13:26,080
- Who's joking? Listen.

160
00:13:32,606 --> 00:13:34,722
Nice huh?

161
00:13:35,406 --> 00:13:37,748
It's Dr. Lennex. I told him my whole

162
00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:40,480
life story from when I was born, almost.

163
00:13:41,047 --> 00:13:45,111
And about you and me. But he told me
that if I lived when I got out, like I

164
00:13:45,112 --> 00:13:49,388
lived before I went in there, chances
are I would be hooked again in no time...

165
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,652
So that's why I want to get with a band.

166
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,171
Listen.

167
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:05,092
- How's that?
- Cute.

168
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,530
- What did you tell him about me, this doctor?
- I told

169
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:12,581
him about getting some
money and getting you well.

170
00:14:14,193 --> 00:14:16,707
Then he said getting with a band
was a good way to go at it.

171
00:14:17,593 --> 00:14:20,505
He even gave me the name of a guy
right here in town, to get a job.

172
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:25,374
I mean with this man, if he's
ever heard of this great doctor.

173
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,340
Most time these things
just don't come through.

174
00:14:29,113 --> 00:14:31,230
- I got this.
- What is it?

175
00:14:31,553 --> 00:14:33,464
It's a letter from the Doc.

176
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:37,836
- I think I'll go call him now
- Now? Let's talk about it tomorrow.

177
00:14:38,407 --> 00:14:41,716
- You'll be all right.
- You've haven't even tasted the cake yet.

178
00:14:42,847 --> 00:14:43,487
- I'lll only be a minute.
- I'lll be right up. No, now Frankie.

179
00:14:43,488 --> 00:14:51,525
- I'lll only be a minute.
- I'lll be right up. No, now Frankie.

180
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:55,678
First, taste a piece of nice....cake.

181
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,574
- Hey, you coming baby?
- Yeah, I知 coming John.

182
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,732
- Molly!
- Yeah, I知 coming John.

183
00:15:20,724 --> 00:15:22,998
I want to talk to Mr. Harry Lane, please.

184
00:15:23,403 --> 00:15:26,051
- How about it huh?
- Machine, Mr. Frankie Machine.

185
00:15:26,504 --> 00:15:29,448
Yeah, I've got a letter of
introduction for him. From Dr Lennex.

186
00:15:31,696 --> 00:15:35,326
- Hello Frankie.
- Dr. Martin Lennex.

187
00:15:37,057 --> 00:15:39,286
- How have you been Molly?
- Okay.

188
00:15:39,656 --> 00:15:42,569
Come on baby, let's go.

189
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:45,887
A guy I met while you was away.

190
00:15:47,017 --> 00:15:51,055
- Mr. Lane. I've got a letter for you.
- Come on, what do you say kiddo?

191
00:15:51,736 --> 00:15:55,908
This afternoon huh? Well I sure do
appreciate it Mr. Lane, thank you very much.

192
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,102
Okay, good-bye.

193
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,921
Frankie! A new thing,
by Brax Department Store.

194
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,863
No sales girls, you just help yourself.

195
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,939
It's what they call an honor system.

196
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,589
What's the matter Frankie?
Feel that material.

197
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,142
And I figured, as long as I'm there....

198
00:16:19,349 --> 00:16:21,275
Nice huh?

199
00:16:21,964 --> 00:16:24,682
You all right? Frankie?

200
00:16:25,604 --> 00:16:28,437
- I got the drummer job.
- Already? Wow!

201
00:16:28,763 --> 00:16:30,800
When I move, I move like a streak.

202
00:16:35,924 --> 00:16:38,154
Think it looks all right?

203
00:16:39,684 --> 00:16:42,596
How come you ask me all of a sudden?

204
00:16:43,644 --> 00:16:46,256
- I just want to know if
it looks all right Sash?

205
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:48,293
- And my name ain't Sash, it's Sophia.

206
00:16:51,657 --> 00:16:53,136
What's the matter?

207
00:16:53,537 --> 00:16:55,312
Nothing's the matter, 'cept how would

208
00:16:55,313 --> 00:16:57,086
you feel if your spine was hurting?

209
00:16:58,937 --> 00:17:02,140
- Why didn't you say so?
- On account of it being

210
00:17:02,141 --> 00:17:05,536
your first day back, and
I didn't want you to worry.

211
00:17:06,097 --> 00:17:09,184
- Don't be like that Sash.
- ls it bad? Maybe

212
00:17:09,185 --> 00:17:11,936
the new doctor will do me some good huh?

213
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:14,568
- We'll go see him when I get back.

214
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:15,862
- Oh, take me now Frankie.

215
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:20,303
Sash, I've got this appointment.
You know how much it means to me..

216
00:17:21,031 --> 00:17:23,066
We'll go as soon as I get back.

217
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,663
- Please Frankie.
- I'lll hurry.

218
00:17:27,271 --> 00:17:30,063
- Well give me a little
more massage first then, huh?

219
00:17:30,064 --> 00:17:34,302
- Sash, I知 doing this for you to get
some money so we can get you a good doctor.

220
00:17:34,991 --> 00:17:35,671
- Frankie...

221
00:17:35,672 --> 00:17:38,957
- Look, I'lll get you a dog
too. Get her a dog, will ya?

222
00:17:39,364 --> 00:17:41,124
I'lll give the job
my personal attention.

223
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,800
Just have confidence in the management.

224
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:47,040
Wish me luck Sash.

225
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:54,117
Frankie!

226
00:17:56,164 --> 00:17:59,077
Wait. Wait Frankie!

227
00:18:32,351 --> 00:18:35,548
- Wishes or wants, what could I do?
- Yeah, she just don't realize.

228
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:40,030
- Shut up punk. Just don't realize. How
would you like to be nailed to a chair?

229
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:53,744
Frankie, Frankie, how are you? Well, it
didn't do you no harm, did it Frankie?

230
00:18:55,499 --> 00:18:56,359
- You look good.

231
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,153
- That's right Shrika, it
was a real country club.

232
00:19:01,845 --> 00:19:03,857
- They give you this
when they let you out?

233
00:19:03,858 --> 00:19:06,235
- They didn't give him
nothing. I got it at Brax's.

234
00:19:06,925 --> 00:19:08,947
I come as soon as I hear
you are out. I figured

235
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:10,884
you was worried about
getting this job again.

236
00:19:11,645 --> 00:19:13,795
Don't worry. Shrika don't forget.

237
00:19:14,525 --> 00:19:17,436
- Job's waiting.
- You need a dealer, you say?

238
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:19,826
Do you? No! I've been dealing myself and

239
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:22,013
I've built up a game
like nobody's business.

240
00:19:22,014 --> 00:19:24,770
I've got a great following.
The play is bigger than ever.

241
00:19:25,818 --> 00:19:28,412
- I hear that you wasn't doing so good.
- From who?

242
00:19:28,738 --> 00:19:31,650
When I say "great", I don't
mean a lot, a few..loaded.

243
00:19:32,618 --> 00:19:34,125
- So, what do you want me for?

244
00:19:34,126 --> 00:19:36,736
- Like I知 telling you.
I take care of my friends.

245
00:19:37,658 --> 00:19:40,570
Can I polish your halo
Shrika, only a quarter

246
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:45,200
Look, I've been doing all right.
But I don't say the customers

247
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:48,740
like me better than they like
you. The dealer makes the house.

248
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,866
- What do you say?
- No!

249
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,904
- You're dealing for some other joint?
- I ain't dealing

250
00:19:55,905 --> 00:19:58,141
for nobody I ain't
dealing for nobody no more!

251
00:19:59,152 --> 00:20:02,934
ls that the way you re-pay me?
Didn't I send money to Sash? Here,

252
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:06,945
I've gone and told all my friends
that you'd be working for me again.

253
00:20:07,352 --> 00:20:09,561
What am I suppose to do?
As far as I'm concerned, you

254
00:20:09,562 --> 00:20:11,606
can go back to matching
pennies with school kids.

255
00:20:17,845 --> 00:20:19,642
Who is he?

256
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:27,345
- ls that a thing with them?

257
00:20:27,346 --> 00:20:29,481
- They see each other.
You want to meet him?

258
00:20:30,886 --> 00:20:33,320
- See ya Frankie.

259
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:39,257
Hey you...

260
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:45,690
- Get in dealer.
- Who me? What for?

261
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,170
- You too punk.
- I didn't do nothing.

262
00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:51,063
Now wait, listen. I知
on my way to get a job.

263
00:20:51,064 --> 00:20:52,175
It's important to me.

264
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:57,449
- You can pick me up some other time.
- I just need an hour

265
00:21:08,912 --> 00:21:11,150
Are you looking at being
sued for liable or something.

266
00:21:11,151 --> 00:21:12,208
I could sue you right now

267
00:21:13,632 --> 00:21:16,164
- You're looking good
Dealer, real good.

268
00:21:16,165 --> 00:21:18,387
- When did they let you out? Monday

269
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:22,584
- What's the charge?
- Shop lifting from Brax, this suit.

270
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,945
- Who told you a thing like that?
- A little birdie.

271
00:21:26,433 --> 00:21:29,345
- A little bird with a cigar.
- Shrika.

272
00:21:30,073 --> 00:21:33,031
ls that all you could stay out
of trouble, two days, dealer?

273
00:21:34,006 --> 00:21:36,801
Listen, I got a chance at a job,
playing with a band. Honest, if

274
00:21:36,802 --> 00:21:39,638
you don't believe me, call the
guy on the phone, he'll tell you..

275
00:21:40,446 --> 00:21:42,203
- Just give me half hour, please.

276
00:21:42,204 --> 00:21:44,120
- Sure, you can have my badge too.

277
00:21:44,526 --> 00:21:45,802
- Book them and hold these two.

278
00:21:45,803 --> 00:21:48,314
- Look, all I need is a half
hour Give me a break, will ya?

279
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:51,236
I don't make the rules dealer.

280
00:21:57,827 --> 00:22:01,892
You can't hold me. I知
incapable. I ain't smart enough to

281
00:22:01,893 --> 00:22:06,097
be running around loose, but
I知 too goofy to be locked up.

282
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:07,546
- Let go of the neck.

283
00:22:07,547 --> 00:22:09,532
- Let go of the neck.
I've got a complaint.

284
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,055
Let go of the neck.

285
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:14,119
Hey you, I知 talking to you.

286
00:22:15,763 --> 00:22:20,154
Oh the old silent treatment huh.
Let's have your number fella..

287
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,129
Frankie, you got a cigarette?

288
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,821
Do a cigarette trick, you know just
to break the dirty monotony.

289
00:23:20,086 --> 00:23:23,214
Hello dealer. I come
running as soon as I heard.

290
00:23:23,215 --> 00:23:25,639
You want I should get you out dealer?

291
00:23:26,047 --> 00:23:30,103
The store will drop the
charges, but 37 bucks is

292
00:23:30,104 --> 00:23:34,159
a lot of dough. How do
I know you'd pay me back?

293
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:38,760
- You fink! - ltd be different
if you was dealing for me.

294
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:42,836
- If you want to deal
for me, I can get you out.

295
00:23:42,837 --> 00:23:44,419
- You dirty lousy, stool pigeon.

296
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,772
I don't know what you mean.

297
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,415
Just trying to do you a favor.

298
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,171
Yes, or no?

299
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,217
Okay...

300
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:09,825
He took off like a whipped dog.
He's scared of you Frankie.

301
00:24:12,113 --> 00:24:15,222
- Nobody's ever been scared of me.
-Them Krautz

302
00:24:15,223 --> 00:24:18,461
was scared of you. You
was a big man in the army.

303
00:24:18,794 --> 00:24:23,072
Big man. I was the guy that picked
the fly spots out of the pepper.

304
00:24:30,874 --> 00:24:33,807
Get me out!

305
00:24:41,487 --> 00:24:44,399
Can you get me a fix?

306
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,898
- Big Ace's and here
we go down and dirty

307
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:05,933
- Better luck next time.

308
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,568
I'lll see that. Coffee!

309
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,111
Doesn't mean a thing,
unless you have the King.

310
00:25:18,112 --> 00:25:18,967
Bet more, win more.

311
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:26,485
you still take tips dealer? Or
don't they pay in the music game?

312
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:30,786
What happened to that
big job you had lined up?

313
00:25:30,787 --> 00:25:32,862
You stink out the joint?
Give us a fresh deck..

314
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:36,263
I decide when we need a
fresh deck at this table..

315
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,652
- Hey Louie. Borrow me a dirty dollar.

316
00:25:38,653 --> 00:25:40,582
- Get back at the door, lame
-brain.

317
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:42,678
- I take orders only from Frankie.

318
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:44,908
- Don't give me lip
you cheap little hustler

319
00:25:45,949 --> 00:25:48,774
Hustler? I知 legit
compared to some. Ain't no

320
00:25:48,775 --> 00:25:51,600
14 year old junkies
waiting around to see me.

321
00:25:53,722 --> 00:25:55,395
Do you want to die?

322
00:25:57,843 --> 00:25:59,879
nd here we go, down and dirty

323
00:26:10,283 --> 00:26:12,399
I'lll deal the next one down..

324
00:26:15,642 --> 00:26:16,108
- Sorry.

325
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:19,607
- What's the sign of when a
dealer's hands begin to shake?

326
00:26:22,496 --> 00:26:24,771
Take over for a while, will ya?

327
00:26:28,016 --> 00:26:30,167
All right men, new deal.

328
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,686
Okay men, here we go, down and dirty

329
00:26:34,336 --> 00:26:36,486
Ace.....seven.....

330
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:57,515
You know what's eating at you? You showed
up the mob, for kicking it for keeps.

331
00:26:57,516 --> 00:27:00,823
So now you're ashamed to think,
well even what you think..

332
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,823
Ain't that right?

333
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:06,382
You know I don't talk about my
customers, so who'd be the wiser?

334
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,966
Why fight it dealer? Who, for what?

335
00:27:11,272 --> 00:27:14,196
Come over to my place. What do you say?

336
00:27:19,843 --> 00:27:22,755
I'lll be around.

337
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,915
They told me you was working
here, so I was passing

338
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:18,794
by and thought I'd come
in and have a drink..

339
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:22,940
- Well, I've been here awhile.
- Doing any good?

340
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,249
All right. Small cut of the
game, usual cut of the drinks.

341
00:28:26,992 --> 00:28:31,401
- Ain't got all night.
- Right. Have something.

342
00:28:32,803 --> 00:28:34,840
- Fine.
- Two doubles.

343
00:28:35,244 --> 00:28:36,801
- You didn't have to do that Frankie.

344
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:39,999
- No reason you should be losing money
by wasting your time talking to me.

345
00:28:41,124 --> 00:28:42,557
You know you're no waste.

346
00:28:43,364 --> 00:28:45,116
I was hoping you'd come see me.

347
00:28:46,884 --> 00:28:50,877
- You know how it is Molly.
- Sure, so busy now.

348
00:28:59,098 --> 00:29:02,009
Here's to it Mollyo.

349
00:29:03,098 --> 00:29:06,010
Mollyo. I haven't heard
that since you went away.

350
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:14,330
- You're looking good Frankie.
- Feel good.

351
00:29:15,177 --> 00:29:18,090
- They tell me you're going to be a drummer now
- Yeah!

352
00:29:18,818 --> 00:29:21,771
- I've got an appointment with a man tomorrow.
- Oh, that's swell.

353
00:29:23,431 --> 00:29:25,706
- Probably I won't get the job though.
- Sure you will.

354
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:28,942
- I don't play good enough.
- I bet you play fine.

355
00:29:29,511 --> 00:29:32,597
You were always whistling and drumming
on tables and things. Real good too.

356
00:29:34,551 --> 00:29:37,463
I mean it! You've got a natural rhythm.

357
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:43,140
I was thinking, maybe of taking
a stage name. Jack Duvall.

358
00:29:44,431 --> 00:29:47,377
- Jack Duvall, Yeah, that's real class.
- lt is, ain't it?

359
00:29:48,116 --> 00:29:50,181
- That's a swell name.
lt fits you Frankie.

360
00:29:50,182 --> 00:29:53,279
- This guy I知 going to see
tomorrow, he books all the big bands.

361
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:57,879
- If I get on with him and wear a tux.
- You look swell in a tux.

362
00:29:58,324 --> 00:30:01,237
- I already got the drums.
- Pardon. I need a buck.

363
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,835
Ante up kid.

364
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,695
I got lonely..

365
00:30:19,938 --> 00:30:25,570
I needed somebody and he's a poor
beat guy who needs somebody too.

366
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,655
Everybody needs somebody.

367
00:30:30,378 --> 00:30:33,290
- But you can do better than him.
- Can I Frankie?

368
00:30:39,653 --> 00:30:41,822
Molly I....

369
00:30:44,151 --> 00:30:46,484
I thought a lot about you when I was

370
00:30:46,485 --> 00:30:48,622
away About you and me and Sash.

371
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:52,530
lt would never work out
between you and me as

372
00:30:52,531 --> 00:30:54,709
long as she is sitting
upstairs in that chair

373
00:30:57,511 --> 00:31:00,424
ltd be different if she didn't love
me, and she wasn't so helpless.

374
00:31:03,353 --> 00:31:05,262
You can't make a fool of someone if

375
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,444
they love you and they're so helpless.

376
00:31:09,525 --> 00:31:11,999
That's why I didn't
come around sooner. And

377
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,360
that's why I ain't
coming around no more.

378
00:31:15,605 --> 00:31:17,163
You understand?

379
00:31:18,765 --> 00:31:21,678
Sure......sure I understand..

380
00:31:26,165 --> 00:31:29,962
- You're a good girl Molly.
- ...real good.

381
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:35,856
Frankie...

382
00:31:40,418 --> 00:31:43,331
Good luck with that fellow tomorrow

383
00:31:52,641 --> 00:31:55,562
You're not the first to come to
me with a letter from Dr Lennex.

384
00:31:56,056 --> 00:31:58,642
- I've taken care of a lot of you people.
- The doctor told me.

385
00:31:58,894 --> 00:32:00,812
I like doing it, you
understand. So don't feel

386
00:32:00,813 --> 00:32:02,649
that this is charity,
or anything like that.

387
00:32:04,175 --> 00:32:07,247
- Have you played professionally before?
- Only down at Lexington.

388
00:32:07,815 --> 00:32:09,336
I see, then you wouldn't
mind auditioning?

389
00:32:09,337 --> 00:32:10,468
I mean I know some band leaders

390
00:32:10,469 --> 00:32:11,777
who might have an opening, but they'd

391
00:32:11,778 --> 00:32:13,014
have to be sure that you can play

392
00:32:13,335 --> 00:32:15,690
- Oh sure, sure.
- Okay...

393
00:32:16,855 --> 00:32:20,165
There's only one thing Frankie.
You see......

394
00:32:21,055 --> 00:32:23,864
A good many people
like yourself, they mean

395
00:32:23,865 --> 00:32:26,546
well, but they're
weak. They let me down.

396
00:32:27,788 --> 00:32:30,312
I mean I go to all this trouble. Vouch

397
00:32:30,313 --> 00:32:33,102
for them, and they go back on the habit.

398
00:32:33,908 --> 00:32:37,219
- lt makes me look bad.
- Oh, I wouldn't honest!

399
00:32:37,548 --> 00:32:39,956
I知 telling you this because, once a

400
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:42,498
man lets me down, I知 done with him.

401
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,563
Even if he comes back on his knees. And

402
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:47,548
don't think that some of them haven't.

403
00:32:48,325 --> 00:32:50,504
- I wouldn't let you down Mr. Lane.
- Good!

404
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:55,559
I'lll call you a week from
Friday, about noon. Okay?

405
00:32:58,002 --> 00:32:59,879
- I sure do appreciate it.
- Oh, forget it.

406
00:33:00,082 --> 00:33:01,879
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

407
00:33:08,762 --> 00:33:11,834
Do you like my hair better
this way, or swept up Frankie?

408
00:33:15,472 --> 00:33:18,407
Well you could at least tell me.
lt ain't my fault he don't phone.

409
00:33:20,095 --> 00:33:21,930
What did I say? Just
don't hold your breath

410
00:33:21,931 --> 00:33:23,724
to hear from that guy,
that's what I said.

411
00:33:24,415 --> 00:33:27,772
He told you noon. Here
it is almost 6 o'clock

412
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:30,764
already so how do you think he'll phone?

413
00:33:37,656 --> 00:33:40,132
I just don't want you should
eat your heart out, is all.

414
00:33:40,133 --> 00:33:43,087
Forget the whole thing
Frankie, I bet he has.

415
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:47,202
You think he's got nothing better
to do than to worry about you?

416
00:33:47,203 --> 00:33:50,069
You think he don't sleep at nights
in account of Frankie Machine?

417
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:52,906
Ha!

418
00:34:06,443 --> 00:34:08,702
Excuse me....

419
00:34:11,642 --> 00:34:14,555
Hello. Oh, just a minute.

420
00:34:15,642 --> 00:34:17,554
It's for you.

421
00:34:18,443 --> 00:34:19,876
Hello..

422
00:34:25,483 --> 00:34:28,793
- Are you Dr. Dominaski?
- Yes, I came as soon as I could.

423
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:39,412
Well, how you feel little lady?

424
00:34:40,096 --> 00:34:42,537
- See, the doctor asks how I知 feeling.

425
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:45,728
- We'll have you feeling
fine in one, two, three.

426
00:34:47,136 --> 00:34:48,206
What is this?

427
00:34:48,656 --> 00:34:54,049
This happens to be an electric blood
reverser and spine manipulator.

428
00:34:55,096 --> 00:34:57,132
- What's the gimmick?
- Gimmick?

429
00:34:57,537 --> 00:35:01,322
lt so happens brother, that I am a
member of the American Association

430
00:35:01,323 --> 00:35:05,270
of Medical Psychology, Hydrology and
Divine Healing. Where's the socket?

431
00:35:08,509 --> 00:35:09,942
Cold hands.

432
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:15,581
Poor circulation. Eat lots of hot things.
Chilies, peppers, hot sauces.

433
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,942
- Pickles?
- Not more than 3 a day.

434
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:25,284
Now lean forward, and we'll
vibrate the vertebrates.

435
00:35:29,283 --> 00:35:32,280
- Know how I got like I am? My
spine was hurt. Oh I can see that.

436
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:34,641
Your ligaments and vertebrates
are locked together.

437
00:35:35,643 --> 00:35:39,079
ln a car accident it was hurt.
Three years ago, May 11th.

438
00:35:39,963 --> 00:35:42,352
Maybe you read about it in the papers huh?

439
00:35:47,124 --> 00:35:50,522
This is the car that it happened
in. That's me, laying there.

440
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,646
My husband was the one driving
the car and he was drunk.

441
00:35:53,976 --> 00:35:56,706
- Drunk?
- He got me in this accident and smashed me up

442
00:35:56,707 --> 00:35:59,290
good, so that I can't walk
anymore or dance anymore.

443
00:35:59,736 --> 00:36:02,649
- And he married me right here, in the hospital chapel.
- Sash!

444
00:36:14,195 --> 00:36:18,354
- Feeling a little better?
- Yeah, much better.

445
00:36:37,808 --> 00:36:40,721
Hey Frankie, guess what?
I got that dog for Sash.

446
00:36:42,264 --> 00:36:47,056
Free spirit! Every claw and hair on
him is a champion. Champion of what?

447
00:36:47,741 --> 00:36:50,654
He brings back empties.
Here, I'lll show you.

448
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,811
He's all dog. You can make money out of him
Frankie.

449
00:37:00,499 --> 00:37:02,011
What he's really good at,
is catching those squirrels

450
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:03,411
in the park, and shaking
the peanuts out of them.

451
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:08,121
Only thing he is trained to chase is a
certain kind of squirrels and they're getting

452
00:37:08,122 --> 00:37:11,417
kind of rare in Chicago, because of the
climate changing. You know what I mean?

453
00:37:12,233 --> 00:37:14,076
So he's just hanging around, waiting for

454
00:37:14,077 --> 00:37:15,827
the climate to change back a little.

455
00:37:16,592 --> 00:37:20,063
He's got a real fighting heart. He's
dizzy, but he still in there trying.

456
00:37:28,352 --> 00:37:32,350
- Take the dog up to Sash.
- Frankie! You're not going with him!

457
00:37:32,924 --> 00:37:34,373
No!

458
00:37:46,446 --> 00:37:48,755
ln a minute dealer.

459
00:38:55,766 --> 00:39:00,843
- Five bucks.
- Last time, it was two.

460
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:05,361
lt was more than 6 months
ago, before you went away..

461
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:09,561
They keep raising the price on me.

462
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:21,292
If they keep doing that, I'lll have
to find something to take its place.

463
00:39:23,942 --> 00:39:28,858
The monkey's never dead dealer.
The monkey never dies.

464
00:39:31,223 --> 00:39:36,422
When you kick him off, he just hides
in a corner, waiting his turn.

465
00:40:00,596 --> 00:40:05,067
The monkey will die waiting. He ain't
climbing up on my back no more.

466
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:10,074
Never again. I mean it.

467
00:40:11,863 --> 00:40:14,802
Sure.....

468
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:29,046
Look Frankie! Look how he drinks it.
It's so cute.

469
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:34,522
He's got a thirst like a bar-fly.

470
00:40:36,662 --> 00:40:38,236
Hello.....

471
00:40:40,544 --> 00:40:42,512
You still expecting
that connection to call?

472
00:40:42,513 --> 00:40:44,218
For you own piece of mind, forget him.

473
00:40:46,424 --> 00:40:49,335
The Doc said that I could count on
Mr Lane, and the Doc doesn't lie.

474
00:40:50,304 --> 00:40:53,932
The Doc. Look at me, a doc told you I'd
be up and around in no time, and am I?

475
00:40:57,103 --> 00:41:00,414
Have you seen my sticks? Have you seen my
drumsticks anywhere?

476
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:03,929
You know what I知 going
to get for this little dog?

477
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,947
A little rain coat,
like for when it rains.

478
00:41:06,757 --> 00:41:09,669
Plaid maybe, or maybe all yellow

479
00:41:10,517 --> 00:41:12,188
Where are my drumsticks, Sash?

480
00:41:15,077 --> 00:41:17,989
- How'd they get up here?
- You liked that, didn't you?

481
00:41:18,237 --> 00:41:21,912
- Sash, I never keep them up here.
- You drank it all up didn't you?

482
00:41:22,237 --> 00:41:23,909
Sash!

483
00:41:29,617 --> 00:41:34,406
I put them there. I stood right up
and I put them there, all right?

484
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:35,441
- No kidding?

485
00:41:35,442 --> 00:41:39,565
- Maybe I, when she was straightening up
for me. I don't know. Stop picking on me.

486
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:50,328
Frankie...

487
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:53,563
You can't keep stoning yourself about it..

488
00:41:54,296 --> 00:41:57,642
There must be a million drummers that
play better than you, who can't get jobs.

489
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,868
Just remember that and
you're going to feel better

490
00:42:02,184 --> 00:42:04,220
Yeah sure, I will.

491
00:42:08,304 --> 00:42:10,295
Can the noise.

492
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:26,510
- What's this for Sash?
- What?

493
00:42:28,518 --> 00:42:32,749
Oh I. She laid it out for groceries.
We owe her even more.

494
00:42:34,838 --> 00:42:37,352
- You got any?
- No.

495
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:41,188
I don't know what we're
doing with all our money

496
00:42:46,928 --> 00:42:49,871
Don't you get enough cards by Shrika?

497
00:42:50,242 --> 00:42:52,599
- I just do it to kill
pass time, that's all.

498
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,290
- Well, what about my pass time?

499
00:42:56,931 --> 00:42:58,367
- What did you say this was for?

500
00:42:58,368 --> 00:43:00,971
- I sit here all the time
and you don't even talk to me.

501
00:43:03,611 --> 00:43:06,523
We got any more beer? I'd like some.

502
00:43:07,732 --> 00:43:11,849
Beer bloats Sash, when you can't exercise.
Here pick a card.

503
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,613
Nothing is good for me. I am only 25
and it's like I'm an old lady already.

504
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:18,964
- ls it my fault I can't exercise?

505
00:43:18,965 --> 00:43:22,214
- Do you want to pick a card,
or don't you want to pick a card?

506
00:43:22,784 --> 00:43:27,017
No, I don稚 pick a card. All
I want is just, is just a Tittle....

507
00:43:29,104 --> 00:43:32,017
- A little what Sash?
- Oh, just a little.....

508
00:43:34,265 --> 00:43:36,540
A little beer, a little
fun, a little anything.

509
00:43:37,184 --> 00:43:40,117
I can't dance anymore, I can't
swim and I can't even drink beer.

510
00:43:41,096 --> 00:43:44,034
I don't even know what
kinds they got anymore.

511
00:43:44,035 --> 00:43:46,909
What other kinds they
got these days Frankie?

512
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:52,220
All right! Pretend I ain't
here. You're wishing all

513
00:43:52,221 --> 00:43:54,389
the time that I'd have
gotten killed that night.

514
00:43:55,318 --> 00:43:57,434
I don't wish any such thing.

515
00:43:59,279 --> 00:44:02,198
If I don't talk, you get mad. If I
say anything, you bite my head off..

516
00:44:03,518 --> 00:44:05,810
I don't know whether I'm
coming or going Sash.

517
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:11,090
I told you, it gives me headaches.

518
00:44:12,011 --> 00:44:13,861
Well, I've got to
practice sometime Sash.

519
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:15,799
If the job comes along,
I want to be ready.

520
00:44:16,572 --> 00:44:20,723
The job, the job! Take it to your
girlfriend if you're going to practice.

521
00:44:29,132 --> 00:44:30,936
What?

522
00:44:31,505 --> 00:44:33,757
Take them down and give her the headache.

523
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:39,788
Do you know what you're saying Sash?

524
00:44:39,789 --> 00:44:41,432
Do you know what you are talking about?

525
00:44:42,186 --> 00:44:44,159
- Don't give me that innocent look.

526
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,259
- I haven't said two words
to her since I come back.

527
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:51,747
- Just cause I sit here, you
don't think I know what goes on?

528
00:44:51,748 --> 00:44:52,658
- Not two words.

529
00:44:53,466 --> 00:44:55,343
I know plenty.

530
00:45:00,507 --> 00:45:03,033
Cut it out will ya Sash.

531
00:45:03,479 --> 00:45:05,858
Take them down to that tramp
if you want to make noise.

532
00:45:05,859 --> 00:45:07,472
Take them down to her, why don't you?

533
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:12,392
All right, I will.

534
00:45:21,759 --> 00:45:24,740
Frankie.....Frankie, I didn't mean.....

535
00:45:33,293 --> 00:45:36,684
- I have 12 cents to a beer.
If I had 15, I'd be all right.

536
00:45:36,685 --> 00:45:38,492
- I've got 6 cents, here ya go.

537
00:45:39,972 --> 00:45:44,124
I ain't going to stand it much longer
The heartaches my old man gives me.

538
00:45:45,253 --> 00:45:50,062
You know what he likes to do most? Tear
the dates off the calendar, watching him.

539
00:45:50,063 --> 00:45:53,171
That's suppose to be my
big Saturday night pleasure.

540
00:45:54,466 --> 00:45:56,820
Sometimes he loses all
control and tears off the

541
00:45:56,821 --> 00:45:59,415
whole week at once. He'll
eat them like a billy-goat.

542
00:46:00,546 --> 00:46:02,955
- Know what would fill up
that empty spot in your life?

543
00:46:02,956 --> 00:46:03,299
- What?

544
00:46:03,706 --> 00:46:06,813
A dog. Ask a satisfied
customer. Frankie that dog I got

545
00:46:06,814 --> 00:46:09,975
you, it makes a big difference
in your life, doesn't it.

546
00:46:10,385 --> 00:46:11,819
Yeah.

547
00:46:14,386 --> 00:46:15,464
I want to see.

548
00:46:17,575 --> 00:46:20,511
- I want to see you.
- After the inning.

549
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:41,446
Hi Frankie.

550
00:46:42,942 --> 00:46:45,274
- You make out all right
with the fellow with the job?

551
00:46:45,275 --> 00:46:46,886
- The drumming job? Yeah, fine, fine.

552
00:46:48,852 --> 00:46:51,765
Well not so fine. He sort
of tapped out on me.

553
00:46:53,292 --> 00:46:55,204
He promised to call me, but..

554
00:46:56,133 --> 00:46:57,565
It's too bad.

555
00:46:57,973 --> 00:47:00,884
There's a million drummers in
the world and how do I rate?

556
00:47:01,973 --> 00:47:03,645
Maybe he lost your number?

557
00:47:04,093 --> 00:47:05,526
lt happens.

558
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:08,949
Maybe he just wishing you'd keep in touch.

559
00:47:10,933 --> 00:47:12,618
He'd think I was a pest.

560
00:47:13,507 --> 00:47:16,942
Why should he? A good drummer, that's
something that don't turn up everyday

561
00:47:18,666 --> 00:47:20,577
Come on Frankie, call him.

562
00:47:23,027 --> 00:47:24,346
Call him Frankie.

563
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,272
Come on Molly, watch the game huh?

564
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,669
Oh I don't feel like it Johnnie. Why
don't you go ahead, I'll wait for you.

565
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,798
Yes studio B, Monday
morning, thank you Mr Lane.

566
00:48:00,618 --> 00:48:02,776
Monday! I got an audition
Monday Me! He told

567
00:48:02,777 --> 00:48:04,886
me to join the union
and get ready to work.

568
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:06,617
- Oh that's wonderful.

569
00:48:06,618 --> 00:48:09,009
- You know, he did lose my phone number

570
00:48:09,413 --> 00:48:11,401
He was trying to find me all week long.
Here I was ready to forget the whole thing.

571
00:48:11,402 --> 00:48:12,963
Gee, if you hadn't opened your
mouth, I wouldn't have called him.

572
00:48:13,413 --> 00:48:16,326
- Sure you would have.
- I've got an audition with a big band.

573
00:48:16,694 --> 00:48:19,606
- Me on TV.
- Practice a lot Frankie.

574
00:48:19,974 --> 00:48:22,546
Practice? I'lll beat
those heads to a shred.

575
00:48:22,547 --> 00:48:24,490
Only I got to find a place where.

576
00:48:25,257 --> 00:48:28,196
Sash can't stand the noise.

577
00:48:28,877 --> 00:48:31,785
Molly? Do you think I
could put the drums in

578
00:48:31,786 --> 00:48:34,886
your place and sort of
drop in once in a while?

579
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:40,802
Why not?
Molly, why not?

580
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:47,438
- Johnny wouldn't understand.
- So, what could he do?

581
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:51,908
lt ain't a question of
what he could do Frankie.

582
00:48:51,909 --> 00:48:54,526
A fellow like Johnnie
can't do much of anything.

583
00:48:55,293 --> 00:48:58,035
It's a question of what
it does to him. I知 all he

584
00:48:58,036 --> 00:49:00,616
has in the world, and I
don't want to hurt him.

585
00:49:01,423 --> 00:49:03,362
- Molly, for crying out loud....

586
00:49:03,363 --> 00:49:06,816
- I want you to know Frankie,
a fellow like him.......

587
00:49:09,144 --> 00:49:12,579
- ...Sometimes when we're all alone....
- What does he do? Cry?

588
00:49:13,263 --> 00:49:16,701
He's a lush Molly. He's a
100 per cent habitual drunk!

589
00:49:17,351 --> 00:49:20,354
Look, everybody's a habitual something.
With him it's liquor, that's all.

590
00:49:21,265 --> 00:49:24,826
- Please Molly. Mollyo.
- lt ain't just that Frankie....

591
00:49:27,472 --> 00:49:30,617
I don't want it to start
with us again. Look what you

592
00:49:30,618 --> 00:49:33,820
said about us not seeing
each other, it was the truth.

593
00:49:36,392 --> 00:49:39,304
Even if we went away, I'd try to.....

594
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:45,128
It just doesn't add up. lt
never did, it never can.

595
00:49:45,662 --> 00:49:49,138
- Well give it a chance.
I told you it would one day

596
00:49:49,139 --> 00:49:51,237
- All my life's been "one day".

597
00:49:54,126 --> 00:49:55,249
- On and on and on.

598
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:59,802
- I've got drums, I知 headed for a
good job. ls that so on and on and on?

599
00:50:00,485 --> 00:50:03,922
I make some money, I make Sash well.
What's so on and on about that?

600
00:50:05,166 --> 00:50:08,077
- Don't shut me out Molly I知 trying.
- You wanted to see me?

601
00:50:09,496 --> 00:50:12,434
- No!
- What do you mean "no"?

602
00:50:21,499 --> 00:50:24,411
- Here, for what we owe.
- Frankie, I says can't trust me.

603
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:27,931
Tell her Frankie, what
an honest hustler I am.

604
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:33,490
Frankie! I guess maybe you
could drop in once in a while.

605
00:50:38,293 --> 00:50:41,224
Thanks Mollyo.

606
00:50:51,352 --> 00:50:54,265
See you tonight Molly.

607
00:52:06,869 --> 00:52:09,780
- How's that?
- Real nice.

608
00:52:13,308 --> 00:52:16,486
- You should have heard what
I did a little while ago...

609
00:52:16,487 --> 00:52:19,107
- Good huh? I hope the
neighbors liked it too.

610
00:52:21,334 --> 00:52:23,822
I知 very big with the
neighbors. They keep banging on

611
00:52:23,823 --> 00:52:26,310
the pipes to let me know
how much they appreciate it.

612
00:52:28,282 --> 00:52:30,761
- I won't let it go to my head though.

613
00:52:30,762 --> 00:52:33,436
- You keep playing drums at 5 a. m.....

614
00:52:33,761 --> 00:52:36,674
and you'll see what goes to your head.

615
00:52:39,882 --> 00:52:42,633
Slip me a smile and I'lll give
you my autograph. You won't

616
00:52:42,634 --> 00:52:45,524
have to fight your way through
the bobby soxers to get to me.

617
00:52:45,855 --> 00:52:48,837
I bet those bobby-soxers go for that.

618
00:52:55,655 --> 00:52:57,407
Tired?

619
00:52:58,215 --> 00:53:01,890
Yes, but in a very nice way. I've
been feeling good all night.

620
00:53:04,415 --> 00:53:07,851
- I joined the musician痴 union today.
- Shrika loan you the money?

621
00:53:09,816 --> 00:53:14,238
- Him? Who did?
- Nobody. I知 going to hock the drums.

622
00:53:15,013 --> 00:53:17,941
- Oh Frankie!
- I've got it figured out pretty good.

623
00:53:18,788 --> 00:53:21,575
When I get a job, I'll take an
advance and get the drums out again.

624
00:53:21,576 --> 00:53:23,419
ln the meantime, I'll
use the practice pads.

625
00:53:23,949 --> 00:53:26,861
- You should have asked Shrika.
- Haven't even seen him.

626
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:31,026
- You didn't go to work?
- No, I've been practicing here all night.

627
00:53:32,989 --> 00:53:34,229
- I quit the game Molly..

628
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:37,353
- lt wouldn稚 have hurt you
to wait a couple of days Frank.

629
00:53:39,333 --> 00:53:43,241
I wanted to quit. I'm
quitting a couple of things.

630
00:53:49,802 --> 00:53:51,600
ls it bad?

631
00:53:55,402 --> 00:53:57,314
Not too bad.

632
00:54:01,642 --> 00:54:03,357
- You shouldn't have started again.

633
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:05,661
- Who knows why I started
in the first place?

634
00:54:08,814 --> 00:54:13,181
I guess in the beginning
you do it only for kicks.

635
00:54:13,182 --> 00:54:16,006
I got my first shot for nothing.

636
00:54:18,696 --> 00:54:22,626
I thought I could take it or
leave it alone. So I took it.

637
00:54:22,627 --> 00:54:24,691
And I took it again and again.

638
00:54:27,375 --> 00:54:31,277
One day Louie wasn't around. I
nearly went crazy till I found him.

639
00:54:33,253 --> 00:54:35,305
Lord I was sick!

640
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:42,463
I was so sick. You can't
be that sick and live.

641
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:46,099
That's when I knew I was hooked.

642
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:52,182
There was a 40 pound monkey
on my back. The only way to get

643
00:54:52,183 --> 00:54:56,171
along with a load like that,
is to keep getting a fix.

644
00:55:05,082 --> 00:55:07,995
Don't.....

645
00:55:12,363 --> 00:55:14,752
I知 one of the lucky ones, Molly.

646
00:55:16,363 --> 00:55:21,810
I kicked it and I'm not too far hooked
to kick it again. I've had my last fix.

647
00:55:26,126 --> 00:55:30,049
Tell me something. Do you think those
bobby-soxers' will really go for me?

648
00:55:33,976 --> 00:55:36,889
Yes, they will.

649
00:55:38,457 --> 00:55:41,368
Maybe I'lll get Sparrow a
job with the orchestra.

650
00:55:43,897 --> 00:55:47,595
And when I can get enough
money together, I can get Sash

651
00:55:47,596 --> 00:55:51,487
into a real good hospital, so
she can walk and dance again.

652
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,028
And then maybe...

653
00:57:33,409 --> 00:57:36,342
- Who is it?
- Shrika, open up!

654
00:57:37,318 --> 00:57:39,155
Just a minute.

655
00:57:45,484 --> 00:57:48,237
- All right where is he?
- Frankie?

656
00:57:48,564 --> 00:57:50,942
- Frankie! Where is he?
- Well what is it, what did he do?

657
00:57:51,164 --> 00:57:54,474
What'd he do? You know what he did, he quit!
No notice, no nothing.

658
00:57:54,684 --> 00:57:56,988
He sends words by that
mistress that he's through.

659
00:57:56,989 --> 00:57:58,975
I had to take the spot
myself. Where is he?

660
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:02,299
- He wasn't at the game?

661
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:05,046
- Would we be looking for him all
over, if he'd been at the game?

662
00:58:05,977 --> 00:58:08,980
He eats my bread. Six years, he
eats my bread. He gets put away, I

663
00:58:08,981 --> 00:58:11,894
send you money regular. He gets
out and I give him his job back.

664
00:58:12,218 --> 00:58:15,129
- Shut up!
- What do you mean "shut up"?

665
00:58:15,538 --> 00:58:17,273
Do you think it was easy
talking men like Williams

666
00:58:17,274 --> 00:58:18,735
and Marquee up to a
two-bit game like you?

667
00:58:19,057 --> 00:58:20,616
- Louis.......Louis.....
- I sold them on Frankie.

668
00:58:20,817 --> 00:58:21,694
Why are we getting excited?

669
00:58:21,897 --> 00:58:24,386
They were a bat in the
pocket and hungry for action.

670
00:58:24,387 --> 00:58:26,311
We finally get a chance to score big....

671
00:58:27,248 --> 00:58:29,300
..and you lose the deal.

672
00:58:30,431 --> 00:58:32,702
Look Louie I swear. When
Marquee and Williams come,

673
00:58:32,703 --> 00:58:35,061
the dealer will be there.
Or a player just as good...

674
00:58:35,511 --> 00:58:36,739
There ain't none as good.

675
00:58:37,391 --> 00:58:39,805
- Why didn't you offer him
more money, a piece of the play.

676
00:58:39,806 --> 00:58:40,811
- From your end or mine?

677
00:58:40,831 --> 00:58:42,665
What's the difference,
whose end? You expect

678
00:58:42,666 --> 00:58:44,377
me to stand here and
argue about pennies?

679
00:58:56,565 --> 00:58:58,156
Look.

680
00:58:58,365 --> 00:58:59,797
I知 a musician..

681
00:59:00,125 --> 00:59:01,444
Well, how does it feel?

682
00:59:01,645 --> 00:59:02,997
Well, it feels like....

683
00:59:04,245 --> 00:59:06,747
You'd better hang on to my arm,
or I'lll go up like a balloon.

684
00:59:07,445 --> 00:59:09,481
I知 a musician.

685
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:11,802
- Where are we going?

686
00:59:11,803 --> 00:59:13,876
- I don't know, but I
want to buy you something.

687
00:59:15,244 --> 00:59:17,295
- No. - I've got to spend
some money or I'lll bust.

688
00:59:17,622 --> 00:59:20,028
- How about one of those, only in green?
- Frankie...

689
00:59:21,047 --> 00:59:23,970
- Maybe a color TV set. They're pretty.

690
00:59:25,898 --> 00:59:27,695
Would you look at this production...

691
00:59:28,858 --> 00:59:31,372
And only for cooking. Now who
would want a thing like that?

692
00:59:33,938 --> 00:59:36,851
- Boy, it's goofy huh?
- It's pretty huh?

693
00:59:38,539 --> 00:59:40,688
- I wonder what he does for a living?
- Him?

694
00:59:42,306 --> 00:59:44,581
He must make a nice
dollar. Look at the way

695
00:59:44,582 --> 00:59:46,649
he dresses her and a kitchen like that.

696
00:59:47,665 --> 00:59:50,412
I notice he doesn't help her. I
bet he didn't even marry the girl.

697
00:59:50,413 --> 00:59:52,462
Look she ain't even wearing
a ring on her finger.

698
00:59:53,112 --> 00:59:55,224
She takes it off when she cooks, maybe

699
00:59:55,225 --> 00:59:57,503
and he's tired after a hard days' work.

700
00:59:58,552 --> 01:00:01,677
Okay, let him sit there, but at least
he could talk to her once in a while.

701
01:00:01,678 --> 01:00:04,349
He doesn't have to sit there with
his nose buried in a magazine.

702
01:00:04,791 --> 01:00:07,706
- I would talk to her.
- What would you say?

703
01:00:08,681 --> 01:00:11,935
I'd say, how you been? How did it go today?
What's for supper?

704
01:00:12,267 --> 01:00:15,197
Steaks for supper and
everything went fine today

705
01:00:15,725 --> 01:00:19,764
Steaks! Good. Now how about you and
me stepping out tonight after we eat.

706
01:00:21,126 --> 01:00:24,755
- Why don't we just stay
home and listen to music?

707
01:00:24,756 --> 01:00:25,324
- Yeah.

708
01:00:26,565 --> 01:00:30,956
I like that better. We'll just
stay home and turn on some music.

709
01:00:32,925 --> 01:00:35,087
I wish it were Monday already.

710
01:00:38,158 --> 01:00:40,083
- Hi Sash!
- Where have you been?

711
01:00:41,019 --> 01:00:43,898
- Shrika has been here. He said you quit.
- Where have you been? Look!

712
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:46,846
- Why did you quit him? I've got
a try-out on Monday -If the band

713
01:00:46,847 --> 01:00:48,011
leader likes me, I知 hired.

714
01:00:48,339 --> 01:00:51,137
Frankie, go tell Shrika you
was fooling, you'll deal.

715
01:00:51,138 --> 01:00:53,572
Maybe this band leader
won't like how you play

716
01:00:53,898 --> 01:00:56,174
Sash look. I joined a musician痴 union.

717
01:00:58,019 --> 01:01:01,412
Why do you got to go around
changing things? Why can't it

718
01:01:01,413 --> 01:01:04,688
be like always? Why do you
got to quit dealing Frankie?

719
01:01:05,501 --> 01:01:07,494
- How we going to live
with no money coming in?

720
01:01:07,495 --> 01:01:08,822
- It'll start coming in Monday.

721
01:01:09,152 --> 01:01:11,112
Suppose they call this
great "try-out" of. You

722
01:01:11,113 --> 01:01:12,864
can't tell me it's a
sure thing, can you?

723
01:01:13,512 --> 01:01:18,189
Frankie, deal for Shrika like always.
Forget this "great" job!

724
01:01:19,072 --> 01:01:22,916
I quit dealing Sash. I can't take the
chance, don't you understand? If the joint

725
01:01:22,917 --> 01:01:26,427
gets raided and I get picked up again,
Mr. Lane would be through with me.

726
01:01:27,123 --> 01:01:29,017
- And then how will I play with a band?

727
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,786
- How you going to play if
Shrika gets your arms broke?

728
01:01:33,646 --> 01:01:35,525
- What?
-Yeah, right here he said it.

729
01:01:35,526 --> 01:01:37,355
And he wanted to slap me around too.

730
01:01:38,846 --> 01:01:41,757
Why can't it be like always?

731
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:11,843
Antek!

732
01:02:17,731 --> 01:02:22,247
- You miserable piece of humanity.
- I've got a right to quit if I want.

733
01:02:22,771 --> 01:02:24,588
- Marquee and Williams
are coming tomorrow.

734
01:02:24,589 --> 01:02:26,817
- Don't you realize the
significance? Leave me alone.

735
01:02:27,294 --> 01:02:31,362
I'lll leave you alone. ln the
alley with the cats looking.

736
01:02:31,806 --> 01:02:33,168
That's enough Shrika. If he don't

737
01:02:33,169 --> 01:02:34,736
want to deal, he don't want to deal.

738
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:39,179
- What are you talking about?
- Don't you raise your voice to me, you slob.

739
01:02:40,184 --> 01:02:42,823
He's no slave. You can't force
him, so what's the use?

740
01:02:43,504 --> 01:02:46,417
- He....
- We've had the best of him all these years. Don't be a pig!

741
01:02:47,504 --> 01:02:49,894
He ain't interested.

742
01:02:50,464 --> 01:02:54,240
All right, all right. Marquee and
Williams have never heard of him.

743
01:02:54,241 --> 01:02:56,405
Money? Something to blow your nose on.

744
01:02:57,335 --> 01:02:58,904
I wash my hands.

745
01:03:01,958 --> 01:03:03,630
He's just a pig, that's all.

746
01:03:05,038 --> 01:03:08,236
Still you can't blame him, so
much. Let the biggest ones get

747
01:03:08,237 --> 01:03:11,433
away, because the best dealer
isn't working for you anymore.

748
01:03:12,718 --> 01:03:14,151
That ain't easy to swallow.

749
01:03:15,078 --> 01:03:16,750
You're the best all right.

750
01:03:17,198 --> 01:03:22,342
- You're a squeeze player Louis.
- Been tried on you before?

751
01:03:23,107 --> 01:03:25,271
NNah, I知 new around here..

752
01:03:26,087 --> 01:03:29,800
- Are we really asking so much dealer?
- One night. I will...

753
01:03:30,212 --> 01:03:33,665
You help us make a bundle and
we'll spread that sunshine around.

754
01:03:33,666 --> 01:03:35,683
Couldn't you use a couple of hundred?

755
01:03:37,171 --> 01:03:40,083
Maybe 2 5 0?

756
01:03:41,892 --> 01:03:44,804
2 5 0 pays a lot of doctor bills.

757
01:03:47,952 --> 01:03:49,079
- Tomorrow huh?
- Frankie...

758
01:03:49,361 --> 01:03:51,090
Let him make up his own mind.

759
01:03:53,665 --> 01:03:59,103
Okay, but for one night. Win or lose.
Sunup, I case the deck.

760
01:03:59,545 --> 01:04:02,225
Sure, you're the
dealer. What a load off.

761
01:04:02,226 --> 01:04:04,778
Now I can sleep. Take care of that arm.

762
01:04:07,945 --> 01:04:11,124
Quite a character huh? Are
you jacking up the price

763
01:04:11,125 --> 01:04:14,120
right now, or do you
really have that music job?

764
01:04:18,958 --> 01:04:21,108
If they like what they hear.

765
01:04:22,638 --> 01:04:26,916
Chancy huh? Nervous?

766
01:04:30,519 --> 01:04:33,480
- So, what are we waiting for?
- Don't talk about it. It's tough enough.

767
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:37,752
I know, I know. I put down a craving once.

768
01:04:39,173 --> 01:04:44,073
No, candy, sweets. I used to
be eating it all the time.

769
01:04:45,212 --> 01:04:48,461
Got examined for the army and they said
you've got sugar in your blood friend.

770
01:04:48,462 --> 01:04:51,093
You've got to give up sweets
forever, or it's good-bye Charlie.

771
01:04:52,412 --> 01:04:58,362
- I had to give up candy.
- My gums bleed for you. It's awful.

772
01:04:59,372 --> 01:05:03,610
lt was. That unfinished feeling
that you got all the time.

773
01:05:03,611 --> 01:05:05,909
Well, I don't have to tell you.

774
01:05:06,474 --> 01:05:10,093
- So don't! -I mean you got this one
thing on the mind all the time.

775
01:05:11,586 --> 01:05:12,847
- Can't stop thinking about it.

776
01:05:12,848 --> 01:05:14,840
- You're just a mine of
information aren't you?

777
01:05:15,385 --> 01:05:16,704
You know what I did?

778
01:05:17,265 --> 01:05:20,154
I said to myself. Okay,
off sweets forever.

779
01:05:20,155 --> 01:05:22,386
Well, forever can start tomorrow.

780
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:27,260
For once in my life, I知 going to
eat all the candy that I can hold. I

781
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:31,352
bought 18 dollars and 20 cents worth
of candy and lugged it up to my room.

782
01:05:32,849 --> 01:05:35,380
All night long, I ate candy

783
01:05:38,199 --> 01:05:42,829
I was sick. I was sweating,
but I kept shoving it in.

784
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:48,809
Ever since then, when I think
about candy I say to myself,

785
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:52,515
well you can't complain. You
once had it and had it good.

786
01:05:55,681 --> 01:05:57,123
You know what I mean?

787
01:06:42,066 --> 01:06:43,625
How's it Mollyo?

788
01:06:44,067 --> 01:06:46,978
- All right Frankie, but where have you been?
- What'll you have?

789
01:06:47,346 --> 01:06:48,468
-A couple of ryes.

790
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:52,247
All day, I was expecting
you'd be in to practice.

791
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:55,025
Practice? I'lll get down
there and knock them dead.

792
01:06:55,026 --> 01:06:57,231
It's all in the wrist and
I've got the touch Molly.

793
01:06:57,883 --> 01:07:00,795
Look at that, steady as a rock. lt
can do anything I want it to do.

794
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:07,995
- Keep the change pal.
- Thanks.

795
01:07:09,084 --> 01:07:11,995
- You got a cigarette Frankie?
- Sure.

796
01:07:27,457 --> 01:07:31,496
You're on it again Frankie. Why, why?

797
01:07:32,497 --> 01:07:35,011
No, listen Molly, listen.

798
01:07:35,457 --> 01:07:36,936
- Why?
- Molly!

799
01:07:37,577 --> 01:07:39,728
- Molly...
- Beat it!

800
01:07:41,148 --> 01:07:41,718
- Take a walk!

801
01:07:41,719 --> 01:07:44,365
- Molly listen to me, I can
explain. Molly I just want to talk.

802
01:07:44,812 --> 01:07:46,047
Will you get out of here!

803
01:07:46,864 --> 01:07:49,782
- Molly.
- Stop it please!

804
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:56,885
- You'll lose your job.
Can't you manage this.

805
01:07:56,886 --> 01:07:58,223
- Molly, listen to me.

806
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:02,263
Leave me alone, both of you!

807
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:04,108
Molly!

808
01:08:22,563 --> 01:08:25,476
Molly... Molly!

809
01:08:28,084 --> 01:08:29,915
Molly... listen to me.

810
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,042
Molly. open the door.

811
01:08:35,494 --> 01:08:36,936
Molly would you open the door

812
01:08:39,567 --> 01:08:42,479
Molly!

813
01:08:49,128 --> 01:08:51,642
Molly! Molly, open the door!

814
01:09:02,644 --> 01:09:04,326
Molly!

815
01:09:07,141 --> 01:09:10,817
Where are you going Molly?

816
01:09:13,141 --> 01:09:15,655
- If you let me explain, you'll know why I did it.
- Taxi!

817
01:09:15,981 --> 01:09:18,893
Molly w Iii you listen. Let
me tell you what's happened.

818
01:09:19,301 --> 01:09:22,213
Where you going Molly?

819
01:09:23,423 --> 01:09:26,354
No Molly! Molly!

820
01:10:08,369 --> 01:10:10,106
- Don't forget to get it cleaned out.

821
01:10:10,107 --> 01:10:11,280
- I already cleaned it.

822
01:10:11,569 --> 01:10:14,075
And say please when you talk
to me, or I'lll buy my own

823
01:10:14,076 --> 01:10:16,446
and go into business for
myself. How's that Frankie?

824
01:10:17,382 --> 01:10:19,305
Nothing huh?

825
01:10:20,803 --> 01:10:25,338
I知 reminding you Shrika,
I get 2-21/2, maybe more.

826
01:10:26,022 --> 01:10:27,932
Would I go back on my word?

827
01:10:36,422 --> 01:10:38,093
How're you feeling dealer?

828
01:10:40,542 --> 01:10:43,594
- Hi ya Shrika.
- Good-evening.

829
01:10:56,156 --> 01:10:57,747
- Yeah?
- ls this the place?

830
01:10:58,075 --> 01:11:00,622
I don't know what place
you mean buddy This is the

831
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:03,069
leather belt and company
You want to buy a belt?

832
01:11:04,556 --> 01:11:07,468
Come right in. We've just started.
How have you been?

833
01:11:09,649 --> 01:11:12,044
- I could handle the door
better if I was blind.

834
01:11:12,045 --> 01:11:14,194
- Oh, you couldn't
heat towels for a barber

835
01:11:15,446 --> 01:11:18,360
- Good-evening Shrika.
- Good to have ya!

836
01:11:19,249 --> 01:11:22,161
You the machine? Man
with the golden arm huh?

837
01:11:23,009 --> 01:11:25,921
Let's see you try and take this away..

838
01:11:38,037 --> 01:11:40,967
Here we go, down and dirty.

839
01:12:01,797 --> 01:12:04,727
No ladies allowed, you know that Vi.

840
01:12:05,378 --> 01:12:07,781
- ls Frankie in there?
- What's the matter?

841
01:12:08,195 --> 01:12:10,896
Sash. I can't get her to
sleep. Her and Frankie had an

842
01:12:10,897 --> 01:12:13,793
argument and she's almost out
of her mind. ls he in there?

843
01:12:14,236 --> 01:12:17,148
- Well, I can't call him now
- I just want to know if he's here?

844
01:12:17,676 --> 01:12:19,132
- I've been bounced around on
the street like a pool ball.

845
01:12:19,133 --> 01:12:20,588
- I've been bounced around on
the street like a pool ball.

846
01:12:21,556 --> 01:12:24,642
- I got to get back in.
- Well tell him she's worried, if you get a chance.

847
01:12:30,063 --> 01:12:33,598
- Three aces. Two pairs.
Possible straight flush.

848
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:35,083
- Aces, two hundred.

849
01:12:36,009 --> 01:12:38,921
I'lll call your two hundred
and raise you two.

850
01:12:40,369 --> 01:12:43,289
I'lll have a look for four hundred and
I'lll spot you three hundred more.

851
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:45,608
It's up to you.

852
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:48,143
- I don't know, I just don't know.

853
01:12:48,144 --> 01:12:49,641
- You've got three aces, show him.

854
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:53,068
- He's got a possible straight
flush, with a queen showing.

855
01:12:53,069 --> 01:12:54,237
- I tell you he's bluffing.

856
01:12:55,392 --> 01:12:57,095
He bluffed me out of a couple tonight.

857
01:12:57,096 --> 01:12:59,695
You wouldn't be jerk enough
to try it again, would you?

858
01:13:00,942 --> 01:13:01,998
- Bet and find out.

859
01:13:01,999 --> 01:13:04,777
- Well bet, bet. I tell
you he's a bluff artist.

860
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:10,534
- Call it.
- I call it and raise it 500 more.

861
01:13:10,983 --> 01:13:13,895
- Sammy!!
- I know what I'm doing!

862
01:13:14,782 --> 01:13:19,663
I'lll have a look and house
bumps you 500 more.

863
01:13:21,164 --> 01:13:24,094
- I told you, I told you he had it.
- Shut up and let me think.

864
01:13:25,308 --> 01:13:28,228
- It's up to you.
- What's the rush, I want to know?

865
01:13:29,917 --> 01:13:31,369
- Your bet, two pairs.

866
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:36,913
- I heard you. What is this? A forced
game? A man has a right to study his hand.

867
01:13:37,716 --> 01:13:39,753
Bet or fold!

868
01:13:40,796 --> 01:13:41,729
- Lose your hand Sammy.

869
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:45,176
- I tell you he's got it, don't throw good
money after bad. I know what I'm doing.

870
01:13:55,489 --> 01:13:56,923
What'd you have?

871
01:13:58,330 --> 01:14:00,002
You didn't pay to find out.

872
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:03,666
Nothing. A lousy two
nines. You let him bluff you

873
01:14:03,667 --> 01:14:06,129
out of a full house,
with a lousy two nines.

874
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:09,818
You do that again at this
table, and you're through.

875
01:14:10,253 --> 01:14:13,949
Ah, forget it this once dealer.
He paid plenty for it.

876
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:21,655
- You're good dealer, maybe too good.
- What do you mean by that?

877
01:14:23,024 --> 01:14:24,535
- Cut the talk. Deal, deal.

878
01:14:24,536 --> 01:14:27,222
- Come on, get some of
this smoke out of here.

879
01:14:28,823 --> 01:14:31,735
- What do you mean too good?
- If the shoe fits brother.

880
01:14:37,191 --> 01:14:39,594
- Okay, that's it for the deck.
- What?

881
01:14:39,927 --> 01:14:43,303
- What?
- Well, we always break up around now

882
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:45,599
- One more round. What about my money?

883
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,545
- One more round. What about my money?

884
01:14:48,237 --> 01:14:51,149
- Frankie, how about it?
- Nope, just give me what's coming to me.

885
01:14:51,517 --> 01:14:54,748
- One more round huh? I'lll deal.
- You? We want to play Machine.

886
01:14:55,437 --> 01:14:58,634
You think I can't sell you a thing or two?
Sit down and we'll get going.

887
01:14:58,837 --> 01:15:00,672
- What about my money?
- As soon as we break.

888
01:15:01,318 --> 01:15:04,360
- Give us a chance. Go home.
- home. You'll get it later.

889
01:15:04,361 --> 01:15:05,776
Okay, ante up, here we go.

890
01:15:06,302 --> 01:15:09,793
- 100.
- Yeah....100...

891
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:13,001
Okay, here we go.

892
01:15:52,904 --> 01:15:54,464
Good morning Frankie.

893
01:17:16,528 --> 01:17:18,040
- ls Louis still here?

894
01:17:18,041 --> 01:17:22,507
- He's doing an apple plexy but
they're doing a sweet in there.

895
01:17:23,278 --> 01:17:24,044
- We're getting murdered.

896
01:17:24,045 --> 01:17:26,190
- You got to get in here and start
dealing. I ain't taking the slot.

897
01:17:26,838 --> 01:17:29,227
- Look. You got to make it stop.
- No deal, no fix.

898
01:17:29,918 --> 01:17:32,638
Give me my money and
I'lll go see someone else.

899
01:17:33,079 --> 01:17:34,875
- You owe it to me.
- Take me to court.

900
01:17:35,198 --> 01:17:39,277
You got to make it stop.

901
01:17:39,605 --> 01:17:41,983
I've got to get some sleep.
I've got to be fresh tomorrow.

902
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:45,308
Work a few hours, do us a favor. I'lll
guarantee you'll feel like a week.

903
01:17:45,639 --> 01:17:48,563
- Please Louis, now.
- Drop dead!

904
01:17:49,292 --> 01:17:50,770
Wait a second.

905
01:17:52,732 --> 01:17:54,403
Okay...

906
01:17:57,932 --> 01:18:00,843
Louis says you've got money for him.
So give it to me, he's waiting.

907
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:05,809
I know he's waiting. They
all say the same thing.

908
01:18:06,746 --> 01:18:09,675
Tell Louis, like he tells us, nothing.

909
01:18:09,844 --> 01:18:11,650
- Not a penny?
- Nope.

910
01:18:12,216 --> 01:18:16,376
- How is it up there?
- How is it up there?

911
01:18:17,304 --> 01:18:21,350
- The dealer is losing huh?
- What happened to that golden arm? Don't worry about the dealer.

912
01:18:21,351 --> 01:18:24,062
The game's just going on a day
and a half, he'll come through.

913
01:18:24,504 --> 01:18:29,020
Why not, with those educated fingers.
Now you see it, now you don't.

914
01:18:30,024 --> 01:18:32,819
You keep your dirty mouth off the
dealer. Frankie runs a clean game

915
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:35,697
and there ain't nothing in the world
that could make him change that.

916
01:18:38,712 --> 01:18:40,628
Hey Antak....

917
01:18:43,557 --> 01:18:47,709
All right, all right. 
Can you let me have 1000?

918
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:51,448
- How about 500?
- 200

919
01:18:51,449 --> 01:18:55,979
I know it's sunday night.
I dind't call you to find what day it is!

920
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:57,848
How checks to you?

921
01:18:58,089 --> 01:19:00,777
Hold it a minute.

922
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:07,487
Give me some of that.

923
01:19:11,691 --> 01:19:14,921
I've got to get out of here Louis. I知 dead.
I haven't slept in two days.

924
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:17,047
It'll be just a little while now

925
01:19:18,290 --> 01:19:20,544
I ain't doing you any good.
The house is still losing.

926
01:19:21,011 --> 01:19:23,972
Stay with it dealer, the class is
beginning to tell. Just stay with it..

927
01:19:24,103 --> 01:19:25,889
- I just can't. My
head won't work no more.

928
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:27,797
- Louis Louis, I'm
running out of guys to call

929
01:19:28,365 --> 01:19:30,172
- Lippy.
- Can't find him.

930
01:19:30,738 --> 01:19:32,303
- I'lll find him. He's loaded.
- I知 getting out of here.

931
01:19:32,745 --> 01:19:37,738
Just a little longer I知 going to make a
call, then I'lll take you over to my place.

932
01:19:45,025 --> 01:19:47,936
- Now where were we.

933
01:20:09,518 --> 01:20:12,430
- Coffee?
- Good and black!

934
01:20:29,651 --> 01:20:33,439
- I can't raise another cent
- How it's going

935
01:20:33,891 --> 01:20:35,325
Every pot almost, they're raising and
raising until we are forced out.

936
01:20:36,012 --> 01:20:36,646
- What day is it?

937
01:20:36,647 --> 01:20:38,923
- Can't you think of anybody
we can tap for a few thousands

938
01:20:40,132 --> 01:20:43,859
- What day is it? ls it Monday yet?
- Listen to me...

939
01:20:45,118 --> 01:20:47,280
- Are you listening to me?
- Wha Wha?

940
01:20:49,622 --> 01:20:53,220
The next big pot they try are forcing
you out, you've got to stay with them.

941
01:20:53,385 --> 01:20:54,933
Shrika won't let me. 
He keeps nudging me to fold.

942
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:56,412
That's 'cause he ain't sure you'll win!

943
01:20:56,565 --> 01:20:58,579
You can't be sure though.
There's a way you can be sure.

944
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:01,940
You can do anything you
want with those cards.

945
01:21:02,265 --> 01:21:04,725
That's only for fun. I haven't
got nerve to do it for real.

946
01:21:04,865 --> 01:21:06,423
- You want to get out of here, don't you?
- What?

947
01:21:06,747 --> 01:21:09,531
- You want to get to that try
-out in good condition, don't you?

948
01:21:09,532 --> 01:21:11,287
- Yeah, I want to get
there feeling good.

949
01:21:11,614 --> 01:21:13,901
Well then make sure, you know what I mean.

950
01:21:14,469 --> 01:21:17,390
Let's get on with the game, I feel hot.

951
01:21:26,638 --> 01:21:28,311
Okay dealer...

952
01:21:49,452 --> 01:21:52,364
- I知 in.
- I知 in.

953
01:21:54,914 --> 01:21:58,834
Three. King. Jack..
- I think that's enough.

954
01:22:01,172 --> 01:22:02,738
Call.

955
01:22:03,545 --> 01:22:06,472
- Pair of strays.

956
01:22:18,447 --> 01:22:21,359
I知 back with 500.

957
01:22:25,176 --> 01:22:28,104
House sees.

958
01:22:31,368 --> 01:22:34,850
Three strays, King, Jacks.

959
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:39,453
I bet 500 bucks.

960
01:22:58,370 --> 01:23:01,291
- Take off your glasses.
- No!

961
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:07,248
- I didn't know. I didn't know.
- I'll get to you in a second.

962
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:12,216
I didn't know. lt hasn't happened before.
Ask anybody.

963
01:23:16,179 --> 01:23:19,106
You don't deal for me no more.

964
01:23:20,321 --> 01:23:23,568
- You want him?
- I wouldn't dirty my hands.

965
01:23:25,064 --> 01:23:26,694
How was I to know. You fellows, you know

966
01:23:26,695 --> 01:23:28,568
I've been running an
honest game. Tell them!

967
01:23:35,834 --> 01:23:37,266
Frankie...

968
01:23:40,313 --> 01:23:42,463
Everything's all right now Frankie.

969
01:23:46,375 --> 01:23:51,187
Frankie, what's a little
cupping around huh?

970
01:23:51,188 --> 01:23:54,716
Nothing. Am I right? You'll see.

971
01:24:03,727 --> 01:24:08,243
You should have seen Shrika's face, when
Williams said he'd get to him in a minute.

972
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:12,338
He went white! lt was so funny

973
01:24:13,794 --> 01:24:15,841
Cut it out, you hear me!

974
01:24:17,011 --> 01:24:21,411
- You was the best sport I knew my whole life.
- You hear me?

975
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:27,251
Stay away from me punk!

976
01:24:53,073 --> 01:24:55,986
- Hurry quick!
- I want to get some sleep.

977
01:24:57,794 --> 01:25:00,155
It's beginning to wear
off quit for you? You're a

978
01:25:00,156 --> 01:25:02,800
graduating student. You're
going to have to step it up.

979
01:25:03,689 --> 01:25:06,616
- Please hurry.
- All right

980
01:25:07,871 --> 01:25:10,799
- Let's see your money.
- Later, later!

981
01:25:11,767 --> 01:25:13,679
- Right now.
- Trust me this once, will you?

982
01:25:14,367 --> 01:25:15,562
No, I don't do that.

983
01:25:16,007 --> 01:25:18,919
I'lll pay you twice as much later, but
I got to do something right now.

984
01:25:19,808 --> 01:25:21,366
I'lll even push for you. Louis heard.

985
01:25:22,167 --> 01:25:25,956
- A flipping junkie always says that.
- Louis, please.

986
01:25:26,768 --> 01:25:28,814
Get your dirty hands off me.

987
01:25:51,821 --> 01:25:53,303
Frankie...

988
01:25:53,625 --> 01:25:56,552
- Wake up. Get up!
- Where did you put it?

989
01:25:57,404 --> 01:26:00,332
- Where do you keep it?
- Let him go.

990
01:26:01,666 --> 01:26:04,587
I can't find it.

991
01:26:05,715 --> 01:26:08,626
Frankie, please let me take you home.

992
01:26:10,674 --> 01:26:13,586
I've got to be on time.

993
01:26:19,397 --> 01:26:21,203
Frankie...

994
01:26:43,768 --> 01:26:46,690
What's the matter. Come on,
let's try to really cook it.

995
01:26:47,902 --> 01:26:49,824
- Mr. Machine.
- Mr. Lanes.

996
01:26:50,276 --> 01:26:51,716
- Can you read music?
- Yes.

997
01:26:52,285 --> 01:26:55,212
Shelby, let Mr. Machine sit in on this one.

998
01:26:59,022 --> 01:27:00,607
Number 37, it's right in front of you.

999
01:27:03,421 --> 01:27:05,094
Do you know it Mr. Machine?

1000
01:27:06,462 --> 01:27:10,057
Okay, let's try.

1001
01:27:10,501 --> 01:27:14,798
Mr. Machine, the first four bars are all you.
Come on, let's try it again.

1002
01:27:15,806 --> 01:27:18,732
One, two, three, four.

1003
01:27:21,032 --> 01:27:23,947
- I知 sorry..
- Are you all set?

1004
01:27:25,395 --> 01:27:28,307
Once again. One, two, three, four

1005
01:28:05,742 --> 01:28:07,708
Okay Shelby, let's go.

1006
01:28:39,111 --> 01:28:40,412
- Sash, have we any money?

1007
01:28:40,413 --> 01:28:42,664
- I need some money.
No, what's the matter?

1008
01:28:44,436 --> 01:28:46,433
There was some around here
yesterday, wasn't there?

1009
01:28:46,434 --> 01:28:47,354
I need some money Sash.

1010
01:28:47,355 --> 01:28:49,187
Well, there isn't any. 
What is it Frankie?

1011
01:28:50,196 --> 01:28:51,629
What is it?

1012
01:29:37,303 --> 01:29:39,976
You can walk? Since when?

1013
01:29:47,063 --> 01:29:51,520
What's the angle? What are you
and Frankie trying to prove?

1014
01:29:54,095 --> 01:29:57,022
Come on tell me. One hustler to another

1015
01:29:57,874 --> 01:30:00,887
Let me in on it or I'lll
croon for it, you hear?

1016
01:30:00,888 --> 01:30:04,145
I'lll tell everybody you
can walk, you always could.

1017
01:30:05,076 --> 01:30:07,988
I'lll tell them all you can
walk, you old phoney!

1018
01:30:10,156 --> 01:30:13,069
No....Louis!

1019
01:30:15,606 --> 01:30:18,532
No Louis, you can't do that. You
can't tell anybody Please Louis.

1020
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:22,190
- Keep your hands off me.
- Please Louis.

1021
01:31:18,517 --> 01:31:21,428
Molly... Molly.

1022
01:31:43,945 --> 01:31:46,657
Ain't that the way it
happened? They had a fight

1023
01:31:46,658 --> 01:31:49,258
and the next thing you
know, Louis is falling.

1024
01:31:50,424 --> 01:31:55,179
Come on, level Sash. Don't try to
out-think me, you'll only get tangled.

1025
01:31:56,065 --> 01:31:58,650
I don't know anything about
a fight. I was sleeping

1026
01:31:58,651 --> 01:32:00,837
the whole morning,
right here in this chair

1027
01:32:01,525 --> 01:32:03,639
Then for all you know,
it did happen that way

1028
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:05,937
While you were sleeping,
Frankie shoved him over.

1029
01:32:06,870 --> 01:32:09,790
- He didn't!
- How do you know it? You were sleeping.

1030
01:32:11,838 --> 01:32:14,504
lt wasn't like I was sleeping,
more like dozing kind of.

1031
01:32:14,505 --> 01:32:16,469
I'd have heard a
fight, if there was one.

1032
01:32:18,318 --> 01:32:20,070
Frankie didn't do it, he wasn't even here.

1033
01:32:20,798 --> 01:32:23,712
- When wasn't he here?
- When it happened.

1034
01:32:24,363 --> 01:32:27,290
How can you be sure if you was dozing?

1035
01:32:28,021 --> 01:32:30,947
I was up when he left. That's how I'm sure.
I saw him go.

1036
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:33,525
And he was home this morning.

1037
01:32:34,771 --> 01:32:38,003
Only a second. He didn't get in a
fight, he was here only a second.

1038
01:32:39,292 --> 01:32:42,204
Why didn't he stick around?
Was somebody after him?

1039
01:32:42,692 --> 01:32:46,047
Nobody was after him, nobody. He
just wanted some money is all.

1040
01:32:46,492 --> 01:32:49,052
- Money? What for?
- I don't know what for.

1041
01:32:49,053 --> 01:32:51,976
A fix! He wanted it for a fix from Louis.

1042
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:56,322
- lt had nothing to do with Louis.
- How do you know?

1043
01:32:57,369 --> 01:32:59,645
Cause there was no money.
Why would he want to

1044
01:32:59,646 --> 01:33:01,776
see Louis for a fix,
he there was no money?

1045
01:33:02,705 --> 01:33:04,741
To try and get one without money

1046
01:33:06,585 --> 01:33:11,818
Okay, I can wait. Wherever he is, sooner
or later he's got to come up for a fix.

1047
01:33:18,882 --> 01:33:21,808
Molly, Molly wait please.

1048
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:24,142
It's finished Frankie. Like I told you.

1049
01:33:24,831 --> 01:33:27,750
- But I've got to talk to you Molly,
- No!

1050
01:33:28,839 --> 01:33:30,635
Once and for all!

1051
01:33:31,318 --> 01:33:34,231
Molly, I've got to talk to you.

1052
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:36,914
You got any money Molly?
I need a few dollars.

1053
01:33:37,919 --> 01:33:40,831
10 dollars would do it. I'd get
it back to you in a few days.

1054
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:45,285
Or 5 even. Five would be fine, please.

1055
01:33:46,222 --> 01:33:51,112
I feel so sick Molly. I hurt all over.
I feel so bad.

1056
01:33:52,731 --> 01:33:57,248
Don't say no, please don't say no.
Why not Molly why not?

1057
01:33:58,053 --> 01:33:59,639
Jump off a rope if you're going to kill

1058
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:01,307
yourself, but don't ask me to help you.

1059
01:34:02,772 --> 01:34:05,684
I'lll do anything for you Molly...

1060
01:34:06,412 --> 01:34:11,426
- But right now you've got to help me. I need a shot.
- No!

1061
01:34:12,717 --> 01:34:17,608
Five would do it, or three or
two even, but please hurry.

1062
01:34:18,383 --> 01:34:20,775
You mustn't take that dirty stuff no more.

1063
01:34:21,226 --> 01:34:24,057
I know, I know you're
right. I promise, but

1064
01:34:24,058 --> 01:34:26,823
right now I just need
a fix. Just one fix.

1065
01:34:27,826 --> 01:34:30,297
It'll help me stop
hurting. Then I promise you,

1066
01:34:30,298 --> 01:34:32,820
I'll kick it for good.
Just a few dollars Molly.

1067
01:34:39,534 --> 01:34:43,260
Hello Molly. I just wanted
to come and say hello.

1068
01:34:44,075 --> 01:34:45,418
- Ain't you going to let me in?

1069
01:34:45,419 --> 01:34:47,628
- I asked you please to
not bother me any more.

1070
01:34:48,679 --> 01:34:52,355
- I miss you.
- Look, I'm awfully tired Johnny.

1071
01:34:52,799 --> 01:34:55,313
- I'lll stay only a few minutes.
- No.

1072
01:34:57,399 --> 01:35:01,321
- Who's in there with you?
- Go away Johnny and don't come back.

1073
01:35:02,011 --> 01:35:04,936
Who is it? Not the dealer! You
ain't hiding him, are you?

1074
01:35:05,828 --> 01:35:08,275
- You wouldn't be dumb enough
to be an accessory would you?

1075
01:35:08,276 --> 01:35:09,498
- What do you mean accessory?

1076
01:35:10,087 --> 01:35:13,005
He killed Louis. The cops are
looking for him this minute.

1077
01:35:13,613 --> 01:35:16,525
- Frankie Machine.
- ls he in there?

1078
01:35:18,453 --> 01:35:20,171
- No.
- I知 coming in!

1079
01:35:20,573 --> 01:35:22,643
Not if you ever want to see me again.

1080
01:35:23,293 --> 01:35:27,694
- Will you meet me tomorrow.
- Yeah, I'lll be around the bar

1081
01:35:28,023 --> 01:35:29,944
Maybe not tomorrow, but soon.

1082
01:35:30,395 --> 01:35:31,754
I miss you.

1083
01:35:41,426 --> 01:35:44,339
Honest, I didn't.

1084
01:35:46,946 --> 01:35:48,539
What am I going to do?

1085
01:35:49,907 --> 01:35:53,956
- Go tell Bedner, it wasn't you.
- I couldn't.

1086
01:35:55,122 --> 01:35:57,522
I couldn't stand up to
the cops the way I am.

1087
01:35:59,622 --> 01:36:03,234
Look at me. I'd say anything they'd
want me to say just for a shot.

1088
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,033
- Then get cured first.

1089
01:36:06,034 --> 01:36:09,958
-What are you talking about?
How am I suppose to get cured.

1090
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:15,594
- You did it once..
- That was with help, with medicine and doctors.

1091
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,922
I can't go apply at Lexington with
a murder hanging over my head.

1092
01:36:21,236 --> 01:36:23,396
Couldn't you do it without going there?

1093
01:36:25,287 --> 01:36:27,091
You mean just stop?

1094
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:30,300
Cold turkey?

1095
01:36:30,984 --> 01:36:33,896
You don't understand. The pain.

1096
01:36:34,864 --> 01:36:36,582
What else can you do?

1097
01:36:37,704 --> 01:36:40,616
All I need is just one shot, just one.

1098
01:36:42,784 --> 01:36:44,702
Okay.

1099
01:36:49,653 --> 01:36:51,812
All right, here take it!

1100
01:36:52,506 --> 01:36:59,628
Here, go on take it all. Cause after that one
shot, all you're going to need is another.

1101
01:37:00,078 --> 01:37:04,116
And then another and another Take it!

1102
01:37:05,518 --> 01:37:07,429
Take it!

1103
01:37:08,317 --> 01:37:12,045
- Why should you hurt,
like other people hurt?

1104
01:37:12,046 --> 01:37:15,456
- You had a dog's
life, but never a break.

1105
01:37:17,113 --> 01:37:21,250
Why try to face it, like most
people do? No just roll up all

1106
01:37:21,251 --> 01:37:25,455
your pains, into one big hurt
and then flatten it with a fix.

1107
01:37:29,051 --> 01:37:31,440
What do you think you'll
find just outside that door?

1108
01:37:34,931 --> 01:37:39,466
Don't you think Bedner knows
what you are, and what you need?

1109
01:37:40,635 --> 01:37:42,920
Just to get through that next hour...

1110
01:37:45,134 --> 01:37:48,820
Don't you know, he's just waiting
for you to come and get it.

1111
01:37:52,224 --> 01:37:55,137
Go on. Let him kill you!

1112
01:37:57,065 --> 01:38:00,853
Let him kill you. It'll be quicker
and better than doing it your way.

1113
01:38:07,491 --> 01:38:09,296
No!

1114
01:38:11,389 --> 01:38:13,308
No!

1115
01:38:14,958 --> 01:38:20,033
I won't let him kill me. No!

1116
01:38:23,318 --> 01:38:25,594
And I won't run into no grave.

1117
01:38:30,049 --> 01:38:32,974
But kicking it......

1118
01:38:35,634 --> 01:38:38,559
A guy can't do it by himself.

1119
01:38:42,972 --> 01:38:45,247
I'lll help.

1120
01:38:48,651 --> 01:38:53,043
You know what you are letting yourself in for?
lt ain't pretty.

1121
01:38:54,294 --> 01:38:56,214
And it could be dangerous.

1122
01:38:57,387 --> 01:39:00,313
If they find you here, then
they find you, is all.

1123
01:39:01,044 --> 01:39:05,376
I don't mean dangerous from Bedner. I mean
dangerous for me.

1124
01:39:08,866 --> 01:39:14,577
Sometimes a junkie will kill,
to get away from the treatment.

1125
01:39:16,066 --> 01:39:17,418
Understand?

1126
01:39:19,625 --> 01:39:21,750
So if you've got any
knives or scissors in the

1127
01:39:21,751 --> 01:39:23,921
house, you've got to put
them away for a while.

1128
01:39:25,771 --> 01:39:28,978
And don't let me out
of the room. No matter

1129
01:39:28,979 --> 01:39:32,113
what I say, or promise,
or how much I beg.

1130
01:39:33,239 --> 01:39:36,151
Cause if I get out, it'll
only be for a fix.

1131
01:39:38,079 --> 01:39:39,876
That's the way it is. Do you understand?

1132
01:39:40,799 --> 01:39:43,080
Just lock me in the room.
And if I try to make a

1133
01:39:43,081 --> 01:39:45,315
break for it, just stop
me any way you know how

1134
01:39:46,924 --> 01:39:49,734
And no matter how much you
see it hurting me, don't

1135
01:39:49,735 --> 01:39:52,545
try to help me with pills
or dope or anything else.

1136
01:39:57,249 --> 01:40:00,164
Do you think you can handle it?

1137
01:40:17,839 --> 01:40:19,643
Here we go.

1138
01:40:21,013 --> 01:40:22,691
Down and dirty.

1139
01:40:26,106 --> 01:40:29,894
You can't hold me.

1140
01:40:32,146 --> 01:40:34,296
Sit down.

1141
01:40:35,186 --> 01:40:39,710
You can't hold me. I ain't got all
my marbles, you know that Captain.

1142
01:40:40,879 --> 01:40:43,163
Write down the cases Sparrow.

1143
01:40:44,092 --> 01:40:47,017
- I didn't do nothing.
- But Frankie did something all right.

1144
01:40:47,748 --> 01:40:49,553
Now, I want you to tell me about it.

1145
01:40:49,958 --> 01:40:53,335
Whoever killed that peddler, should
get a ticker-tape parade. Yeah, and

1146
01:40:53,336 --> 01:40:56,477
maybe I'd lead the band, but I
still want you to tell me about it.

1147
01:40:57,399 --> 01:41:00,288
Listen to me Sparrow. When
we catch him, he stands

1148
01:41:00,289 --> 01:41:02,950
trial, whether you talk,
or whether you don't.

1149
01:41:05,325 --> 01:41:08,250
The only question is, do I
ticket you as an accessory?

1150
01:41:10,268 --> 01:41:12,325
Bedner, don't nail me to the cross. He's

1151
01:41:12,326 --> 01:41:14,484
the only guy I've ever had for a friend.

1152
01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:18,799
He's nobody's friend anymore.
He smash you with a steam

1153
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:21,931
roller, if you got between
him and a pop in the arm.

1154
01:41:22,932 --> 01:41:25,844
Come on talk Sparrow.

1155
01:41:29,652 --> 01:41:31,731
Okay, beat it.

1156
01:43:32,199 --> 01:43:35,111
Let me out!

1157
01:44:07,459 --> 01:44:09,504
Yes?

1158
01:44:17,541 --> 01:44:19,790
- I thought I'd come and
see how you've been Sash.

1159
01:44:19,791 --> 01:44:21,334
- All alone, that's how I've been.

1160
01:44:23,306 --> 01:44:26,218
Something to eat. Sausage.

1161
01:44:27,306 --> 01:44:31,983
All alone and worried sick. Where is he?
Do you know where he is?

1162
01:44:32,991 --> 01:44:34,669
Did he go to you?

1163
01:44:36,685 --> 01:44:38,490
What do you want anyway?

1164
01:44:39,257 --> 01:44:44,512
What do you want anyway?

1165
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:49,119
I didn't tell Bedner anything. The
papers, they twist everything all up.

1166
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:51,830
They wouldn't be able to,
if you didn't let them.

1167
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:55,431
I can't help what they do. What do
you expect me to do, sitting here?

1168
01:44:57,120 --> 01:45:00,919
Just tell Bedner that Frankie wasn't here
when it happened. That he didn't do it.

1169
01:45:01,735 --> 01:45:02,823
- I never said he did.

1170
01:45:02,824 --> 01:45:06,384
- But that's how it sounds, if he
was the only one around at the time.

1171
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:09,598
And you know it was somebody else.

1172
01:45:10,732 --> 01:45:13,009
What do you mean? Who?

1173
01:45:13,814 --> 01:45:17,727
don't know. But maybe Bedner could figure
it out if he didn't think it was Frankie.

1174
01:45:18,173 --> 01:45:20,210
What business is it of yours anyway?

1175
01:45:20,413 --> 01:45:22,244
I just want to help, that's all.

1176
01:45:23,373 --> 01:45:26,854
Who are you kidding? You think I
don't know what you really want?

1177
01:45:28,109 --> 01:45:30,404
You think I don't know what
you and him have been up to

1178
01:45:30,405 --> 01:45:32,740
behind my back, while I had
to sit here all these years?

1179
01:45:33,090 --> 01:45:36,575
- Had to sit here all these years.
- No Sasha, you've got it wrong.

1180
01:45:36,906 --> 01:45:40,257
No! You've got it wrong!
He put me in this chair,

1181
01:45:40,258 --> 01:45:43,540
and as long as I sit
here, he'll never leave me.

1182
01:45:44,107 --> 01:45:47,019
- He knows he belongs to me.
- Sash, I came only to help.

1183
01:45:47,627 --> 01:45:49,558
I wouldn't want to live it he left me,

1184
01:45:49,559 --> 01:45:52,150
and I would rather see
him dead, than go to you.

1185
01:45:52,597 --> 01:45:54,640
- Sash, please.
- YES, get out of here!

1186
01:45:54,966 --> 01:45:57,125
Get out of here you lousy tramp!

1187
01:45:57,938 --> 01:46:00,863

1189
01:47:06,508 --> 01:47:09,423
- I can't stand it any longer
- Just a little longer.

1190
01:47:09,833 --> 01:47:12,757
Please help me. Keep me warm.

1191
01:47:17,665 --> 01:47:20,589
I've got to get out and get a fix.

1192
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:25,470
Open the door, or I'lll kill you..

1193
01:47:26,281 --> 01:47:29,193
- I'lll kill you.
- Frankie, listen, if you......

1194
01:47:29,841 --> 01:47:31,952
- But I do have something
put away to make it stop.

1195
01:47:31,953 --> 01:47:32,886
- Give it to me quick!

1196
01:47:36,208 --> 01:47:38,252
Where? I'lll get it.

1197
01:47:43,799 --> 01:47:46,723
Molly! Molly!

1198
01:47:47,934 --> 01:47:50,847

1199
01:47:52,295 --> 01:47:55,206
Molly open the door.

1200
01:48:08,286 --> 01:48:11,210

1201
01:48:19,868 --> 01:48:22,780
Frankie answer me. Are you all right?

1202
01:48:23,989 --> 01:48:26,901
Don't think you can fool me
into opening this door I won't.

1203
01:48:28,115 --> 01:48:31,038
Are you all right Frankie?
Please answer me.

1204
01:48:41,882 --> 01:48:46,160
Molly, if you love me, kill me, please!

1205
01:48:47,162 --> 01:48:50,073
Oh, I知 so cold.

1206
01:48:54,730 --> 01:48:57,654
Make me warm.

1207
01:49:02,199 --> 01:49:05,123
Molly...

1208
01:49:08,255 --> 01:49:10,405
Please Molly, make me warm...

1209
01:49:15,335 --> 01:49:18,486
Oh Molly, I知 so cold!

1210
01:49:30,943 --> 01:49:32,302
Oh God, Oh God.

1211
01:49:32,708 --> 01:49:35,621
Please make me warm Molly.

1212
01:49:37,309 --> 01:49:40,221
I知 so cold..

1213
01:50:19,445 --> 01:50:23,614
- I waited for you in the bar.
- I told you it might not be right away

1214
01:50:23,941 --> 01:50:27,702
I thought maybe you were sick or something.
I just wanted to tell you, don't look

1215
01:50:27,703 --> 01:50:31,417
for me at the bar anymore. He threw me
out last night, we had a little argument.

1216
01:50:31,941 --> 01:50:34,853
- So make it the Safari huh?
- Yeah, sure Johnny, sure.

1217
01:50:41,764 --> 01:50:43,682
Pretty good, huh Molly?

1218
01:50:46,261 --> 01:50:49,185
- Take it slow now.
- Oh, I知 all right.

1219
01:50:49,593 --> 01:50:51,506
Just a little rocky.

1220
01:51:06,131 --> 01:51:09,055
It's the most gorgeous day I ever saw.

1221
01:51:10,627 --> 01:51:13,551
I think it's the first day I ever saw.

1222
01:51:14,563 --> 01:51:17,359
I've got a craving for something sweet.
Have you got anything sweet?

1223
01:51:18,209 --> 01:51:20,244
- Sugar?
- Gimme!

1224
01:51:26,849 --> 01:51:29,766
More, come on, more.

1225
01:51:32,506 --> 01:51:35,428
How can you Frankie?

1226
01:51:36,882 --> 01:51:43,216
I never felt this good In my life. I feel like all
the things inside of me are settling Into place.

1227
01:51:45,302 --> 01:51:48,214
Thanks Molly. Mollyo!

1228
01:51:49,783 --> 01:51:53,457
- Look out, you'll scrape your face off!
- I don't care.

1229
01:51:55,587 --> 01:51:58,510
- You got a razor I can use?
- Can I trust you with one?

1230
01:51:59,241 --> 01:52:01,399
Cross my heart.

1231
01:52:24,330 --> 01:52:25,895
- ls this the place?
- Yeah.

1232
01:52:26,338 --> 01:52:29,262
- Okay, come on.
- No please, you don't need me up there.

1233
01:52:50,344 --> 01:52:53,268
- Where is he Molly?
- He didn't do it, honest.

1234
01:52:53,701 --> 01:52:56,625
I知 not a judge. They pay me
to bring him in, that's all.

1235
01:52:57,878 --> 01:53:01,434
If you tell me where he is, I promise you
that he'll get every break a jockey can get.

1236
01:53:01,886 --> 01:53:05,322
- He's no jockey either. That's finished.
- Oh sure, you bet.

1237
01:53:06,365 --> 01:53:07,757
- You can see for yourself.

1238
01:53:07,758 --> 01:53:10,438
- He ain't running away
from you. So, where is he?

1239
01:53:12,245 --> 01:53:16,220
- With Sash.
- All right Molly. Let's go see.

1240
01:53:27,299 --> 01:53:30,894
- Hello Sash.
- What are you doing here?

1241
01:53:31,659 --> 01:53:34,158
- Frankie, don't you know
that Bedner is looking for you?

1242
01:53:34,159 --> 01:53:36,096
- Don't worry about it
Sash, I ain't afraid.

1243
01:53:36,980 --> 01:53:41,383
- I didn't do it and you know that
- Who did then?

1244
01:53:42,917 --> 01:53:45,841
I've come to tell you something Sash.....

1245
01:53:46,210 --> 01:53:50,298
- I知 leaving here.
- Bedner will arrest you. He told the newspapers you.....

1246
01:53:52,633 --> 01:53:55,544
- What?
- I知 leaving.

1247
01:53:56,993 --> 01:53:59,486
You won't have to worry
about money or anything.

1248
01:53:59,487 --> 01:54:01,622
I find a way to send
some regular to you.

1249
01:54:02,992 --> 01:54:05,911
- And I will take good care of you.
- Leaving me!?

1250
01:54:07,726 --> 01:54:10,649
Not leaving you Sash, just leaving.

1251
01:54:12,343 --> 01:54:16,067
You saw what happened since I came back.
Like Dr. Lennex told me.....

1252
01:54:17,562 --> 01:54:21,276
I got in the same old routine and
before I knew it, I was on it again.

1253
01:54:22,526 --> 01:54:26,360
But you can't leave me. You've
got to stay and take care of me.

1254
01:54:28,087 --> 01:54:30,602
I know I'm responsible
for how you are Sash....

1255
01:54:31,411 --> 01:54:34,333
but I can't go around the rest of
my life stoning myself about it.

1256
01:54:35,305 --> 01:54:38,363
I've been carrying my heart
ever since it happened.

1257
01:54:38,364 --> 01:54:41,244
Even now it hurts me to
think about it, but.....

1258
01:54:45,620 --> 01:54:48,531
Well, it's not that I want
to leave, I've got to leave.

1259
01:54:50,339 --> 01:54:53,252
You mustn't leave Frankie! You mustn't.

1260
01:54:54,940 --> 01:54:56,612
Sash....

1261
01:54:57,986 --> 01:55:01,960
- Say good-bye to me Sash.
- You think you're fooling me?

1262
01:55:02,965 --> 01:55:05,122
I know what's pulling you away Molly!

1263
01:55:06,056 --> 01:55:08,979
- No. - Yeah, you just go so that
you can be with that little tramp!

1264
01:55:11,994 --> 01:55:13,665
- Frankie no...
- Good-bye Sash.

1265
01:55:13,801 --> 01:55:15,836
No Frankie, please don't leave.

1266
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:19,992
Frankie no, don't leave me.

1267
01:55:42,774 --> 01:55:45,163
Get dressed Sash..

1268
01:56:21,093 --> 01:56:22,657
Sash!

1269
01:56:27,116 --> 01:56:28,713
Sash Stop!

1270
01:56:32,321 --> 01:56:33,754
Sash!

1271
01:56:50,197 --> 01:56:51,522
Sash!

1272
01:56:56,335 --> 01:56:58,974
Sash, don't move.

1273
01:57:00,015 --> 01:57:02,403
Don't try to talk. You're
going to be all right.

1274
01:57:09,104 --> 01:57:12,028
I love you so much!
