- Oh.

11
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,208
Sylvie, I'm getting a divorce.

12
00:04:16,293 --> 00:04:20,504
- What? From Charles?
- He's the only husband I have.

13
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:25,468
- I've tried to make it work,
really I have, but - - But what?

14
00:04:25,552 --> 00:04:29,096
I can't explain. It’s just that I'm too
miserable to go on any longer like this.

15
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:35,269
It is infuriating that your unhappiness
does not turn to fat.

16
00:04:37,898 --> 00:04:41,567
But I don't understand.
Why do you want a divorce?

17
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:44,528
Because I don't love him.
And he obviously doesn't love me.

18
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:47,114
That's no reason to get a divorce.

19

With a rich husband
and this year's clothes...

to make some new friends.

21
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:54,789
I admit I came to Paris
to escape American provincial...

22
00:04:54,873 --> 00:04:57,875
but that doesn't mean I'm ready
for French traditional.

23
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,586
I loathe the whole idea
of divorce, Sylvie.

24
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,838
But if only Charles had
been honest with me.

25
00:05:02,923 --> 00:05:05,174
That's all I ask of anybody:
the simple truth.

26
00:05:05,258 --> 00:05:09,970
But with Charles,
everything is secrecy and lies.

27
00:05:11,515 --> 00:05:13,682
He's hiding something
from me, Sylvie -

28
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:17,269
something terrible -
and it frightens me.

It’s hers. Where'd you find him?
Robbing a bank?

31
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,276
He was throwing snowballs
at Baron Rothschild.

32
00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:27,571
- Oh, thank you.
- Do we know each other?

33
00:05:27,656 --> 00:05:31,075
- Why? Do you think we're going to?
- I don't know. How would I know?

34
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:33,327
Because I already know
an awful lot of people.

35
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:36,288
Until one of them dies
I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.

36

Hmm. Well, if anyone goes
on the critical list, let me know.

- You're blocking my view.
- Oh.

43
00:06:05,777 --> 00:06:08,821
- Which view would you prefer?
- The one you're blocking.

44
00:06:08,905 --> 00:06:11,574
It’s my last chance.
I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon.

45
00:06:11,658 --> 00:06:14,076
- What's your name?
- Peter Joshua.

46
00:06:14,161 --> 00:06:16,829
- Mine's Regina Lampert.
- Is there a Mr. Lampert?

47
00:06:16,913 --> 00:06:18,080
- Yes.
- Good for you.

48

No, it isn't.
I'm getting a divorce.

49
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,960
- Please, not on my account.
- No. I don't really love him.

50
00:06:23,044 --> 00:06:26,589
- At least you're honest.
- Hmm. Is there a Mrs. Joshua?

51
00:06:26,673 --> 00:06:28,966
Yes, but we're divorced.

52
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,343
That wasn't a proposal.
I'm just curious.

Is your husband with you?

Oh, no, Charles is never with me.

- I've enjoyed talking with you.
- Now you're angry.

see each other again?

- Shakespeare never said that.
- How do you know?

It’s terrible.
You just made it up.

Well, it sounds right.
You going to call me?

- Well, Charles is.

- Is there only one Charles Lampert?
- Mmm.

When you get your divorce,
are you going back to America?

00:07:23,313 --> 00:07:24,858
Don't you want me to stay?

69
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,150
Of course, but if you went
back and wrote me a letter -

70
00:07:28,235 --> 00:07:30,903
You could have the stamps.
I'll get you some here, okay?

[Grandpierre]
We discovered your husband's body...

84
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:54,713
lying next to the tracks
of the Paris-Bordeaux railroad line.

85
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:58,050
He was dressed only in his pajamas.

86
00:09:58,134 --> 00:10:02,763
Do you know of any reason
why he might have wanted to leave France?

87
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:05,182
Leave? No.

88
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:10,062
Your husband possessed
a ticket of passage on the Maranguape.

89
00:10:10,146 --> 00:10:13,315
It sailed for Venezuela
this morning at 7:00.

90
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,317
I'm very confused.

91
00:10:15,402 --> 00:10:18,904
- He was American, your husband?
- Swiss.

92
00:10:18,988 --> 00:10:21,782
Ah, Swiss.
His profession?

93
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:24,702
- He didn't have one.
- He was a wealthy man?

94
00:10:24,786 --> 00:10:26,704
I suppose so.
I don't know.

95
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:30,040
- About how wealthy, would you say?
- I don't know.

96
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,251
Where did he keep his money?

97
00:10:32,335 --> 00:10:34,253
I don't know.

98
00:10:34,337 --> 00:10:37,756
Besides yourself,
who is his nearest relative?

99
00:10:37,841 --> 00:10:42,594
- I don't know.
- That's absurd, madame. Totalement absurde.

100
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,888
I know. I'm sorry.

101
00:10:44,973 --> 00:10:48,475
- It is all right?
- I wish you wouldn't.

- [Man] D'accord.

103
00:10:57,068 --> 00:10:59,427
On Wednesday last,
your husband sold the entire

104
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:01,613
contents of the apartment
at public auction.

105
00:11:01,698 --> 00:11:03,615
Everything.

106
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,910
The gallery paid him
1,250,000 new francs -

107
00:11:06,995 --> 00:11:09,788
in dollars,
a quarter of a million.

108
00:11:09,873 --> 00:11:13,208
The authorities in Bordeaux searched
his compartment on the train.

109
00:11:13,293 --> 00:11:15,210
They searched it thoroughly.

110
00:11:15,295 --> 00:11:18,172
They did not find $250,000.

111
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,804
These few things are all that was found
in the train compartment.

112
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:29,975
There was no other baggage.
Your husband must have been in a great hurry.

113
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:34,313
One wallet containing 4,000 francs.

114
00:11:34,397 --> 00:11:38,275
One agenda. His last notation was
made yesterday, Thursday -

115
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:41,153
5:00 p.m., Jardins des Champs-Élysées.

116
00:11:41,237 --> 00:11:43,155
- Why there?
- I don't know.

117
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:47,826
- Perhaps he met somebody.
- Obviously.

118
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:50,454
One ticket of passage to South America.

119
00:11:50,538 --> 00:11:55,334
One letter, stamped but unsealed,
addressed to you.

we would learn something.

- Did you?
- Yes.

130

131
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,543
One key to your apartment.

132
00:12:37,627 --> 00:12:40,587
One comb.

133

That is all.

If you will sign this list,
you may take the things with you.

Is that all?
May I leave now?

One more question.

139
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,819
Is this your husband's passport?

Yes.

00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,128
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

460
00:36:00,237 --> 00:36:02,154
[Woman Gasps]
Alistair!

461
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:05,866
- [Man] What is it now, Pamela?
- It happened again.

462
00:36:05,951 --> 00:36:10,412
Another strange man peered
in the window at me but then went away.

463
00:36:10,497 --> 00:36:12,581
Bad luck, Pamela.

464
00:36:32,894 --> 00:36:36,146
- That was a dumb move, Herman.
- Oh, man. And then some.

465
00:36:36,231 --> 00:36:38,607
If you'd let us known
you was goin' to her room...

466
00:36:38,692 --> 00:36:40,609
we could have done somethin'
to keep him busy.

467
00:36:40,694 --> 00:36:44,154
But sneakin' up thataway by yourself.

468
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:46,615
What did you expect him to do?

469
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,390
Walk up and shake you
by that hand of yours?

470
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,686
A dumb move, Herman.
A dumb move.

471
00:36:51,746 --> 00:36:55,332
Yes, it was a dumb move, Herman.
What is the matter with you?

472
00:36:55,417 --> 00:36:59,586
- You want some more?
- Never mind that. Did you get the money?

473
00:36:59,671 --> 00:37:03,924
How could I with the three Marx Brothers
breathing down my neck?

474
00:37:04,009 --> 00:37:06,593
I thought we had an agreement.

475
00:37:08,221 --> 00:37:10,139
Now, the girl trusts me.

476
00:37:10,223 --> 00:37:13,517
If she's got the money, I'll find out
about it. But you just leave me alone.

477
00:37:13,601 --> 00:37:18,689
We took all the chances.
The money belongs to us, not to him.

478
00:37:18,773 --> 00:37:22,026
Now, don't be piggy, Herman.

479
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:25,863
A third of nothing is nothing.
Just think about that.

480
00:37:25,947 --> 00:37:29,325
But make up your mind.
She's waiting for me.

481
00:37:29,409 --> 00:37:32,453
I don't see how another 24 hours
could hurt anything.

482
00:37:32,537 --> 00:37:34,705
Shoot, no.
Not after all these years.

483
00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:38,584
Then he gets it out of your share.

484
00:37:38,668 --> 00:37:45,424
Not mine.

485
00:37:46,593 --> 00:37:49,136
Either one of you
got the room next to her?

486
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,138
Yeah, I have. Why?

487
00:37:51,222 --> 00:37:54,016
Give me the key.
Get another room. I want to use it.

488
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,101
Hmm.

489
00:38:01,399 --> 00:38:04,485
If you do find that money...

490
00:38:04,569 --> 00:38:07,571
you ain't gonna forget
to tell your buddies about it, are ya?

491
00:38:07,655 --> 00:38:11,950
- Don't worry.
- [Chuckling] Oh, no, I ain't worryin'.

492
00:38:12,035 --> 00:38:14,453
You see this little fella here?

493
00:38:14,537 --> 00:38:17,206
Oh, he worries.

494
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:19,500
And he's even meaner than I am.

495
00:38:42,023 --> 00:38:45,025
- Who is it?
- It’s me, Peter.

496
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,837
There was no trace of him.

497
00:39:06,381 --> 00:39:10,092
Why don't you confide in me
and tell me what this is all about?

498
00:39:11,886 --> 00:39:14,638
There are three men.
He's one of them.

499
00:39:14,722 --> 00:39:18,225
They think I have a quarter of a million
dollars that belongs to them.

500
00:39:21,062 --> 00:39:23,814
- Go on.
- That's all.

501
00:39:23,898 --> 00:39:27,484
- No, it isn't. Where's the money?
- I don't know.

502
00:39:27,569 --> 00:39:31,822
They killed Charles to get it, but he must
not have had it with him on the train.

503
00:39:31,906 --> 00:39:34,324
- So they think he left it with you.
- But he didn't.

504
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:37,661
I've looked everywhere, and if I
don't find it they're going to kill me.

505
00:39:39,414 --> 00:39:41,665
No, they won't.
I won't let them.

506
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:45,878
Peter, help me.
You're the only one I can trust.

507
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:49,882
I'll help you.

508
00:39:49,966 --> 00:39:52,009
I told you I would. Come on.

509
00:39:52,093 --> 00:39:55,471
Oh, I'm so hungry I could faint.

510
00:39:55,555 --> 00:39:58,098
[Sniffling]
And I've gotten your suit all wet.

511
00:39:58,183 --> 00:40:02,186
- That's all right. It’s a drip-dry.
- [Sighs]

512
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,688
- Wipe your eyes.
- [Sniffling]

513
00:40:06,232 --> 00:40:08,692
Promise me you'll never lie to me
the way Charles did.

514
00:40:08,776 --> 00:40:11,570
Why do people have to tell lies?

515
00:40:11,654 --> 00:40:16,325
Usually it's because they want something.
They're afraid the truth won't get it.

516
00:40:16,409 --> 00:40:19,620
- Do you tell lies?
- [Phone Buzzing]

517
00:40:28,129 --> 00:40:30,714
- Hello?
- Mrs. Lampert, it's me...

518
00:40:30,798 --> 00:40:33,634
the man who was in your room
a few minutes ago.

519
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:37,221
- What do you want?
- Who is it?

520
00:40:37,305 --> 00:40:39,515
It’s the man you had the fight with.

521
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,684
- Is Dyle with you?
- Who?

522
00:40:42,769 --> 00:40:47,231
The man I had the fight with, lady.
Dyle. That's his name.

523
00:40:47,315 --> 00:40:49,942
What's wrong?
Is he still there?

524
00:40:54,072 --> 00:40:59,076
- Yes, that's right.
- What's he saying?

525
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:03,247
Don't trust him.
Don't tell him anything.

526
00:41:03,331 --> 00:41:05,541
He's after the money.

527
00:41:13,758 --> 00:41:15,676
What was all that about?

528
00:41:17,178 --> 00:41:19,096
He -

529
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,755
He said if I don't give
him the money he'll kill me.

530
00:41:21,767 --> 00:41:23,225
Oh, don't take it seriously.

531
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:27,312
He's just trying to frighten you.

532
00:41:27,397 --> 00:41:30,732
- I believe what he said.
- No, no. It’s just a lot of words.

533
00:41:30,817 --> 00:41:33,151
Words can hurt.

534
00:41:33,236 --> 00:41:35,112
I know.

535
00:41:35,196 --> 00:41:38,156
Try to get some sleep.
You'll feel better.

536
00:41:38,241 --> 00:41:42,786
Don't worry. I've arranged
to take the room next door to you.

537
00:41:44,706 --> 00:41:47,040
So you'll be all right.

538
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:49,459
If you want anything,
just bang on the wall.

539
00:41:49,544 --> 00:41:52,129
Better lock the door after me.

540
00:41:52,213 --> 00:41:54,965
Good night.

[Door Closes]

542
00:42:23,328 --> 00:42:26,663
But I am calm, Mr. Bartholomew.
What I'm trying to say is that -

543
00:42:26,748 --> 00:42:28,624
is that there's someone else.

544
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:29,489
What?

545
00:42:29,501 --> 00:42:31,752
Someone who wasn't in that
photograph you showed me today.

546
00:42:31,836 --> 00:42:35,255
He says his name is Peter Joshua,
but it isn't. It’s Dyle.

547
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:40,594
- Are you still there, Mr. Bartholomew?
- Yes, yes, Mrs. Lampert.

548
00:42:40,678 --> 00:42:43,555
Uh, I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is...

549
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,683
but it's possible we were wrong
about who killed your husband.

550
00:42:46,768 --> 00:42:49,978
You mean... he might have?

551
00:42:51,147 --> 00:42:53,523
Mr. Bartholomew,
I'm catching the next plane out of here.

552
00:42:53,608 --> 00:42:56,693
I'm not going to sit around for somebody
to make chopped liver out of me.

553
00:42:56,778 --> 00:43:00,072
Now, take it easy, Mrs. Lampert.
Take it easy.

554
00:43:00,156 --> 00:43:03,075
Uh, where are you now?
Can you meet me at the market?

555
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:06,161
- At Les Halles?
- Yes. Opposite Saint-Eustache.

556
00:43:06,245 --> 00:43:09,956
- I'll meet you there in 15 minutes.
- All right. I'll be there in 15 minutes.

557
00:43:57,171 --> 00:44:00,173
Allez vite, n'importe où.
N'importe où! Vite!

558
00:44:09,058 --> 00:44:11,017
Suivez ce taxi.

559
00:44:16,149 --> 00:44:20,569
- Were you followed?
- Yes, by Dyle. But I lost him.

560
00:44:20,653 --> 00:44:23,113
I'm beginning to think
women make the best spies.

561
00:44:23,197 --> 00:44:25,115
Agents.

562
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:28,326
- He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew.
- No.

563
00:44:28,411 --> 00:44:31,621
- But I saw it.
- No, that's not Carson Dyle.

564
00:44:31,706 --> 00:44:32,591
Carson?

565
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:35,292
There's only one Dyle connected
with this affair, Mrs. Lampert.

566
00:44:35,376 --> 00:44:37,294
That's Carson Dyle.

567
00:44:37,378 --> 00:44:39,546
You mean you've known
about him all along?

568
00:44:40,548 --> 00:44:43,258
It’s enough to make you
a vegetarian, isn't it?

569
00:44:44,218 --> 00:44:48,180
It’s just lucky I'm not hanging
next to one of those things right now.

570
00:44:49,807 --> 00:44:52,142
Why didn't you tell me
you knew about Dyle?

571
00:44:52,226 --> 00:44:54,394
I didn't see any point.
Dyle's dead.

572
00:44:56,689 --> 00:44:58,899
Mr. Bartholomew,
what is all this about?

573
00:44:58,983 --> 00:45:03,945
In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -

574
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:06,323
the military espionage unit -

575
00:45:06,407 --> 00:45:08,575
were ordered behind the German lines...

576
00:45:08,659 --> 00:45:14,080
for the purpose of delivering
$250,000 in gold...

577
00:45:14,165 --> 00:45:16,625
to the French underground.

578
00:45:16,709 --> 00:45:19,085
The five men were, of course,
your husband Charles...

579
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:21,838
the three men who showed up
at his funeral yesterday...

580
00:45:21,923 --> 00:45:24,216
and Carson Dyle.

581
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,351
Oh.

582
00:45:25,363 --> 00:45:28,553
But instead of delivering the
gold, they stole it.

583
00:45:28,638 --> 00:45:31,097
- How?
- By burying it...

584
00:45:31,182 --> 00:45:33,975
then reporting
the Germans had captured it.

585
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,353
All they had to do was
come back after the war...

586
00:45:36,437 --> 00:45:39,022
dig it up and split it five ways.

587
00:45:39,106 --> 00:45:43,485
Quarter of a million dollars
with no questions asked.

588
00:45:43,569 --> 00:45:45,862
May I have a cigarette, please?

589
00:45:46,948 --> 00:45:49,032
I can't stand those things.

590
00:45:49,116 --> 00:45:52,035
It’s like drinking coffee through a veil.

591
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:56,331
Everything went smoothly enough
until after the gold was buried.

592
00:45:56,415 --> 00:46:00,627
Before they could get out,
they were ambushed by a German patrol.

593
00:46:00,711 --> 00:46:04,130
A machine gun separated
Scobie from his right hand...

594
00:46:04,215 --> 00:46:07,217
and caught Carson Dyle
full in the stomach.

595
00:46:07,301 --> 00:46:09,219
[Stammering]

596
00:46:10,805 --> 00:46:13,056
What was wrong with that one?

597
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,976
Nothing, I guess.
What happened then?

598
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:18,559
Have you any idea what
these things cost over here?

599
00:46:18,571 --> 00:46:20,105
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew.

600
00:46:20,189 --> 00:46:22,148
What happened then?

601
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:29,739
Carson Dyle was dead,
but Scobie was able to travel. So -

602
00:46:29,824 --> 00:46:32,784
- La soupe, c'est pour qui?
- Pour moi.

603
00:46:42,336 --> 00:46:44,254
Where was I?

604
00:46:44,338 --> 00:46:46,756
- Carson Dyle was dead.
- Yes. Carson Dyle was dead.

605
00:46:46,841 --> 00:46:49,968
The others finally got back to the base
and waited for the war to end...

606
00:46:50,052 --> 00:46:52,888
only Charles couldn't wait
quite as long as the others.

607
00:46:52,972 --> 00:46:56,725
He beat them back to the gold,
took everything for himself and disappeared.

608
00:46:56,809 --> 00:47:00,604
It’s taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie
all this time to catch up with him again.

609
00:47:00,688 --> 00:47:04,608
But if they stole all that money,
why can't you arrest them?

610
00:47:04,692 --> 00:47:07,068
Shh.

611
00:47:07,153 --> 00:47:11,197
We know what happened from the bits and
pieces we were able to paste together...

612
00:47:11,282 --> 00:47:13,491
but we still have no proof.

613
00:47:13,576 --> 00:47:16,202
What's this got to do with the C.I.O.?

614
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:23,168
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert.

615
00:47:23,252 --> 00:47:26,630
It’s an extension of the wartime O.S.S.

616
00:47:26,714 --> 00:47:28,757
It’s our money, and we want it back.

617
00:47:28,841 --> 00:47:32,636
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew,
but nothing you've said has changed my mind.

618
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,846
I'm leaving Paris tonight.

619
00:47:35,932 --> 00:47:38,558
Wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert.

620
00:47:38,643 --> 00:47:41,978
Better consider what happened
to your husband when he tried to leave.

621
00:47:42,063 --> 00:47:44,731
Those men won't be very far away
no matter where you go.

622
00:47:44,815 --> 00:47:47,692
In fact, I don't even see any point
in your changing hotels.

623
00:47:47,777 --> 00:47:50,487
Now, please help us, Mrs. Lampert.

624
00:47:50,571 --> 00:47:53,156
Your government is counting on you.

625
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,408
[Sighs]

626
00:47:55,493 --> 00:47:58,662
Well, if I'm going to die,
I might as well do it for my country.

627
00:47:58,746 --> 00:48:01,998
That's the spirit.
Here's what I want you to do.

628
00:48:02,083 --> 00:48:05,669
We're anxious to know who this man is -
the one calling himself Dyle.

629
00:48:05,753 --> 00:48:07,629
I want you to find out.

630
00:48:07,713 --> 00:48:10,006
Why me?

631
00:48:10,091 --> 00:48:12,759
You're in an ideal position.
He trusts you.

632
00:48:12,843 --> 00:48:18,306
Besides, you yourself said
women make the best spies.

633
00:48:18,391 --> 00:48:21,017
Agents.

634
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,781
[Woman]
Oh, pardon.

635
00:48:58,055 --> 00:49:01,558
- Fräulein. Fräulein.
- What are you doing following me?

636
00:49:01,642 --> 00:49:05,645
It’s gonna look like a parade. Stop it.

637
00:49:07,023 --> 00:49:08,940
[Horn Honking]

638
00:49:11,986 --> 00:49:14,320
How are you? Nice to see you.
When did you arrive?

639
00:49:14,405 --> 00:49:17,574
It’s a lovely town. Are you having a good
time? So many things to see.

640
00:49:17,658 --> 00:49:20,535
[Tires Screech]

641
00:49:23,664 --> 00:49:25,373
Fräulein.

642
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:27,375
Fräulein!

643
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:30,170
If you don't stop following me,
I'll call the police.

644
00:49:32,298 --> 00:49:34,090
Taxi!

[Phone Ringing]

646
00:49:57,239 --> 00:49:59,324
Dyle, please. D-Y-L-E.

647
00:49:59,408 --> 00:50:01,409
Yes, Mr. Dyle. I remember.

648
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:10,293
- No, I'm sorry, Mr. Dyle. Nothing today.
- Thank you.

649
00:50:10,377 --> 00:50:13,630
[Woman On P.A.] Mr. Dyle, please.
You're wanted on the telephone.

650
00:50:13,714 --> 00:50:15,757
Mr. Dyle. Cabin four.

651
00:50:15,841 --> 00:50:18,176
Mr. Dyle. Cabin four, please.

652
00:50:25,726 --> 00:50:29,646
- Yes?
- [Regina] Good morning, Mr. Dyle.

653
00:50:31,232 --> 00:50:34,150
- Reggie?
- It’s the only name I've got. How about you?

654
00:50:34,235 --> 00:50:36,736
No cat and mouse. You've got me.
What do you want to know?

655
00:50:36,821 --> 00:50:38,988
Why you lied to me.

656
00:50:39,073 --> 00:50:42,075
I had to. For all I knew,
you were in on the whole thing.

657
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:45,829
- I'm trying to find out who you are.
- You know my name. It’s Dyle.

658
00:50:45,913 --> 00:50:47,831
Carson Dyle is dead.

659
00:50:47,915 --> 00:50:50,291
Yes, he is.
He was my brother.

660
00:50:51,794 --> 00:50:53,670
Your brother?

661
00:50:53,754 --> 00:50:56,840
The army thinks he was
killed in action by the Germans...

662
00:50:56,924 --> 00:51:01,010
but I think they did it -
Tex, Gideon, Scobie and your husband -

663
00:51:01,095 --> 00:51:04,514
because my brother wouldn't
go along with their scheme to steal the gold.

664
00:51:04,598 --> 00:51:06,850
I think he threatened
to turn them in and they killed him.

665
00:51:06,934 --> 00:51:11,980
I'm trying to prove it. They think
I'm working with them, but I'm not, Reggie.

666
00:51:12,064 --> 00:51:14,190
I'm on your side.
Just believe that.

667
00:51:14,275 --> 00:51:17,235
How can I? You lied to me
just the way Charles did.

668
00:51:17,319 --> 00:51:19,237
After promising you wouldn't.

669
00:51:19,321 --> 00:51:21,865
Oh, I want to believe you, Peter -

670
00:51:21,949 --> 00:51:23,867
I can't call you that anymore, can I?

671
00:51:23,951 --> 00:51:27,912
Take me a while to get used to
your new name. What is it?

672
00:51:28,956 --> 00:51:30,957
Hmm? Hello?

673
00:51:32,459 --> 00:51:34,460
Hello?

674
00:51:47,349 --> 00:51:50,393
Do anything funny or try to
talk to anyone and I'll kill you, Dyle.

675
00:51:50,477 --> 00:51:52,687
You'll wreck your raincoat.

676
00:51:53,772 --> 00:51:55,690
Take the next car, please.

677
00:52:13,542 --> 00:52:16,628
Look out.
Didn't want you to bump your head.

678
00:52:18,505 --> 00:52:21,174
All right, get in there.

679
00:52:30,851 --> 00:52:32,852
All right, turn around.

680
00:52:41,695 --> 00:52:44,197
- [Bullets Clatter]
- Now sit down.

681
00:52:55,042 --> 00:52:59,003
- Now what?
- We wait. With our mouth shut.

682
00:53:07,846 --> 00:53:09,889
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

683
00:53:20,901 --> 00:53:23,861
Okay. Up there.

684
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:35,832
- Do I knock or something?
- No, open it...

685
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:38,376
and keep right on goin'.

686
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:41,004
The view had better be worth it.

687
00:53:55,144 --> 00:53:57,145
Very pretty. Now what?

688
00:54:00,107 --> 00:54:02,275
I was afraid of that.

689
00:54:06,655 --> 00:54:11,117
I'll give you a chance, Dyle,
which is more than you'd give me.

690
00:54:12,161 --> 00:54:14,162
Where's the money?

691
00:54:15,456 --> 00:54:19,500
Is that why you dragged me all the way
up here? To ask me that?

692
00:54:19,585 --> 00:54:23,713
- She has it.
- And I say maybe you both have it.

00:54:23,797 --> 00:54:28,259
One more time, Dyle.
Where is it?

694
00:54:28,344 --> 00:54:32,722
Supposing I had it -
which I don't -

695
00:54:32,806 --> 00:54:36,142
do you really think
I'd just hand it over to you?

696
00:54:39,104 --> 00:54:41,022
Step back.

697
00:54:43,984 --> 00:54:45,902
Back where?

698
00:54:45,986 --> 00:54:48,696
That's the idea.

699
00:54:48,781 --> 00:54:53,659
Hmm. Now - Now, just a minute.
Take it easy.

- How do you think?

If you get bored,
try writing "Love thy neighbor"

- You gonna open up?
- Sure. Wait a minute.

Don't you know it's impolite
to leave someone holding... the phone?

712
00:57:32,861 --> 00:57:34,779
What happened?

- Scobie?
- Mm-hmm.

I left him hanging around
the American Express.

717
00:57:45,332 --> 00:57:48,251
Come in. I've got something
that stings like crazy.

718
00:57:48,335 --> 00:57:51,254
You're the kind of girl
that'd have something like that.

719
00:57:51,338 --> 00:57:53,256
Sit down.

00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:55,258
Uh, w-w-wait a minute.

- Marvelous stuff.

than it's gonna hurt me.

Sit still. It’s not too bad.

You won't be able to
lie on your back for a few days.

But then, you can lie from
any position, can't you?

- Does it hurt?

like they do in the movies?

Would you like to see my passport?

00:58:33,297 --> 00:58:35,840
Passport?
What kind of a proof is that?

739
00:58:35,924 --> 00:58:38,289
Well, would you like to
see where I was tattooed?

740
00:58:38,301 --> 00:58:39,093
Yes.

741
00:58:39,177 --> 00:58:41,596
All right.
We'll drive around that way.

742

[Groaning]

743
00:58:43,682 --> 00:58:47,602
You could at least tell me
what your first name is these days.

744
00:58:47,686 --> 00:58:50,438
Alexander.

745
00:58:50,522 --> 00:58:52,440
Okay, Alexander.

746
00:58:52,524 --> 00:58:54,442
- You're done.
- Good.

747
00:58:54,526 --> 00:58:56,944
You're a new man.

748
00:58:57,029 --> 00:58:59,947
I'm sorry the old one
couldn't tell you the truth...

749
00:59:00,032 --> 00:59:03,492
but I had to find out
your part in all this.

750
00:59:03,577 --> 00:59:05,494
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?

751
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:07,496
Yes.

752
00:59:07,581 --> 00:59:09,957
But we're divorced.

753
00:59:10,042 --> 00:59:12,168
I thought that was Peter Joshua.

754
00:59:12,252 --> 00:59:15,129
I'm just as difficult
to live with as he was.

755
00:59:16,423 --> 00:59:19,383
Alex, how can you tell
if anyone's lying or not?

756
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:22,928
- You can't.
- There must be some way.

757
00:59:23,013 --> 00:59:25,931
There's an old riddle about
two tribes of Indians.

758
00:59:26,016 --> 00:59:29,060
The Whitefeet always tell the truth,
and the Blackfeet always lie.

759
00:59:29,144 --> 00:59:31,062
One day you meet an Indian.
You say...

760
00:59:31,146 --> 00:59:35,066
"Hey, Indian, what are you,
a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot?"

761
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:38,235
He says, "I'm a truthful Whitefoot."
But which is he?

762
00:59:40,697 --> 00:59:43,115
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?

763
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,992
Because he's wearing moccasins.

764
00:59:45,077 --> 00:59:47,495
Well, then, he's a truthful Whitefoot,
of course.

765
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:49,246
Why not a lying Blackfoot?

766
00:59:50,624 --> 00:59:54,418
- Which one are you?
- A truthful Whitefoot.

767
00:59:56,129 --> 00:59:58,214
Come in.

768
00:59:58,298 --> 01:00:00,716
- Sit down.
- Why? Do you wanna look at my feet?

769
01:00:00,801 --> 01:00:03,010
Yes.

770
01:00:04,554 --> 01:00:08,015
Uh-oh. Ohh. Hey, knock it off.
Come on, Reggie. Listen to me.

771
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,017
Here it comes, the fatherly talk.

772
01:00:10,102 --> 01:00:13,229
- You forget I'm already a widow.
- So was Juliet, at 15.

773
01:00:13,313 --> 01:00:14,114
But I'm not 15.

774
01:00:14,126 --> 01:00:16,565
Well, that's your trouble.
You're too old for me.

775
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:19,902
- Can't you be serious?
- Oh! You just said an horrible word.

776
01:00:19,986 --> 01:00:22,405
- What did I say?
- Serious.

777
01:00:22,489 --> 01:00:25,950
When I man gets to be my age,
that's the last word he ever wants to hear.

778
01:00:26,034 --> 01:00:29,995
I don't want to be serious,
and I especially don't want you to be.

779
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:34,500
Okay, we'll just sit around all day long
being frivolous. How about that, hmm?

780
01:00:34,584 --> 01:00:37,044
- [Giggling]
- Reggie, cut it out.

781
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:40,047
Okay.

782
01:00:40,132 --> 01:00:42,591
- Now what are you doing?
- Cutting it out.

783
01:00:42,676 --> 01:00:45,010
- Who told you to do that?
- You did.

784
01:00:45,095 --> 01:00:47,179
I'm not through complaining yet.

785
01:00:47,264 --> 01:00:49,181
Oh.

786
01:00:52,018 --> 01:00:55,354
- Now cut it out.
- Alex, I think I love you.

787
01:00:57,858 --> 01:00:59,775
[Buzzing]

788
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,944
- [Moaning, Giggling]
- Hey, the telephone's ringing.

789
01:01:02,028 --> 01:01:03,946
- Never mind.
- [Buzzing Continues]

790
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:06,949
Whoever it is won't give up,
and neither will I.

791
01:01:07,033 --> 01:01:08,951
Just a minute.
Go on, take it.

792
01:01:09,035 --> 01:01:10,953
[Sighs]

793
01:01:11,037 --> 01:01:13,497
Hello.
[Giggles]

794
01:01:13,582 --> 01:01:16,751
I'm sorry, uh -
I was just, uh -

795
01:01:16,835 --> 01:01:18,753
nibbling on something.

796
01:01:18,837 --> 01:01:20,755
Say, I'd appreciate it mighty highly...

797
01:01:20,839 --> 01:01:24,759
if you'd, uh, wiggle on over to Room 46
and chew the fat for a spell.

798
01:01:24,843 --> 01:01:27,094
Could you give me
one good reason why I should?

799
01:01:27,179 --> 01:01:31,766
Yeah. A little one, about six or seven.

800
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:34,059
Keeps callin' for Aunt Reggie.

801
01:01:34,144 --> 01:01:36,771
[Chuckles]
Ain't that cute?

802
01:01:36,855 --> 01:01:39,231
They've got Jean-Louis.

803
01:01:40,442 --> 01:01:43,068
I'll be right there.

804
01:01:45,489 --> 01:01:49,408
Hey, Tex, do somethin' with this kid,
will ya? My leg's goin' to sleep.

805
01:01:49,493 --> 01:01:52,077
Upsy-daisy.

806
01:01:52,162 --> 01:01:54,079
Are you a real cowboy?

807
01:01:54,164 --> 01:01:56,081
[Chuckles]
Yeah, sure I am, kid.

808
01:01:56,166 --> 01:01:58,083
So where's your gun?

809
01:02:01,588 --> 01:02:04,173
Will you put that thing away!

810
01:02:04,257 --> 01:02:06,175
Jean-Louis.

811
01:02:06,259 --> 01:02:08,260
Howdy, Miz Lampert.

812
01:02:09,304 --> 01:02:11,263
Who invited him?

813
01:02:11,348 --> 01:02:13,682
Well, Herman, I see
you had a happy landing.

814
01:02:13,767 --> 01:02:15,684
I must call Sylvie right away.

815
01:02:15,769 --> 01:02:17,860
I'm afraid that'll have to wait, Mrs.
Lampert.

816
01:02:17,872 --> 01:02:18,687
It’s his mother.

817
01:02:18,772 --> 01:02:21,941
She won't be anybody's mother
unless you answer some questions.

818
01:02:22,025 --> 01:02:25,110
- [Tex] This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
- We want that money now.

819
01:02:25,195 --> 01:02:28,531
Why don't you keep quiet and
stop threatening the child.

820
01:02:28,615 --> 01:02:32,243
He hasn't got the money,
and neither has Mrs. Lampert.

821
01:02:32,327 --> 01:02:33,619
Then who does?

822
01:02:33,703 --> 01:02:36,705
I don't know, Herman.
Maybe you do.

823
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:38,499
Me?

824
01:02:38,583 --> 01:02:41,418
- Or you.
- Ohh.

825
01:02:41,503 --> 01:02:42,294
Or him.

826
01:02:42,306 --> 01:02:44,713
Why, that's the most
ridiculous thing I ever -

827
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:47,716
- Listen to this man.
- Man's gone loco.

828
01:02:47,801 --> 01:02:52,513
Now hold it. Suppose one of you
found Charles here in Paris.

829
01:02:52,597 --> 01:02:54,515
Even bumped into him by accident...

830
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:58,143
followed him when he tried to run out again,
cornered him on the train...

831
01:02:58,228 --> 01:03:01,105
threw him out the window and,
without bothering to tell the other two...

832
01:03:01,189 --> 01:03:03,148
took all the money for yourself.

833
01:03:03,233 --> 01:03:05,040
If one of us did that,
he wouldn't hang around

834
01:03:05,065 --> 01:03:06,718
waiting for the other
two to figure it out.

835
01:03:06,778 --> 01:03:10,656
But he'd have to. Don't you see?
If he left, he'd be admitting his guilt.

836
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:13,701
Whoever it is has to wait here
pretending to look for the money...

837
01:03:13,785 --> 01:03:16,912
waiting for the rest of us
to give up and go home.

838
01:03:16,997 --> 01:03:20,249
He's just tryin' to throw us off.
They got it, I tell ya.

839
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:22,751
Why don't we search their rooms?

840
01:03:23,837 --> 01:03:25,754
That's all right with us.

841
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:29,258
Then what are we wastin' time for?
Let's go.

842
01:03:29,342 --> 01:03:32,177
- While we're waiting, we'll search yours.
- Not my room.

843
01:03:32,262 --> 01:03:36,223
Well, Herman.
You have something to hide?

844
01:03:37,934 --> 01:03:40,603
Then there are no objections.

845
01:03:40,687 --> 01:03:42,605
All right, here's my key.

846
01:03:42,689 --> 01:03:45,357
- I'll take that.
- My room's open.

847
01:03:45,442 --> 01:03:47,359
Everyone. Whoa.
Come on.

848
01:03:49,613 --> 01:03:52,531
Now, you two
just make yourselves to home here.

849
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:56,285
Well, let's get busy.

850
01:03:56,369 --> 01:03:59,788
Come on, Jean-Louis.
Come along. Oh, that's fine.

851
01:03:59,873 --> 01:04:02,791
- Who gets your vote?
- Scobie. He's the one who objected.

852
01:04:02,876 --> 01:04:05,794
All right,
I'll take Tex's room here and Gideon's.

853
01:04:05,879 --> 01:04:08,964
You take Jean-Louis with you,
and bolt the door from inside.

854
01:04:09,049 --> 01:04:11,717
Come on, Jean-Louis.
We'll have a treasure hunt.

855
01:04:14,346 --> 01:04:16,263
Tex?

856
01:04:18,892 --> 01:04:20,809
Man, that's Charlie's stuff.

857
01:04:20,894 --> 01:04:22,811
Looks like it.

858
01:04:22,896 --> 01:04:25,314
- Think we ought to call Herman?
- What for?

859
01:04:25,398 --> 01:04:28,317
If it's not here,
why bother him?

860
01:04:28,401 --> 01:04:30,444
And if it is?

861
01:04:30,528 --> 01:04:32,571
Why bother him?

862
01:04:32,656 --> 01:04:34,573
[Chuckles]

863
01:04:36,368 --> 01:04:38,494
Oh.

864
01:04:38,578 --> 01:04:41,497
- What?
- Sure there's nothing missing here?

865
01:04:41,581 --> 01:04:45,709
No, everything's here. The police
have kindly provided us with a list.

866
01:04:47,253 --> 01:04:50,172
Sure ain't nothin' here
worth no quarter of a million dollars.

867
01:04:50,256 --> 01:04:52,174
Not unless we're blind.

868
01:04:52,258 --> 01:04:55,511
I keep telling myself
we've stolen a great deal of money...

869
01:04:55,595 --> 01:04:58,514
but up to now I've yet
to see a penny of it.

870
01:04:58,598 --> 01:05:01,600
You think maybe we're fishin'
up the wrong stream?

871
01:05:02,936 --> 01:05:04,853
Meaning what?

872
01:05:04,938 --> 01:05:08,732
Suppose one of us has it.
You know, like the man says.

873
01:05:08,817 --> 01:05:11,026
Now, that'd be mighty distasteful...

874
01:05:11,111 --> 01:05:14,029
us bein' veterans
of the same war and all.

875
01:05:14,114 --> 01:05:18,867
Well, you know I'd tell you if I had it.

876
01:05:18,952 --> 01:05:22,079
Oh, naturally.
Just like I'd tell you if I had it.

877
01:05:22,163 --> 01:05:24,081
Naturally.

878
01:05:24,165 --> 01:05:26,417
And that goes for Herman, too.

01:05:32,298 --> 01:05:34,967
He's all right, Sylvie. Honestly.

881
01:05:35,051 --> 01:05:38,137
Just hurry over as soon as you can.
Okay. Good-bye.

882
01:05:39,973 --> 01:05:43,559
Now, if you had a treasure,
where would you hide it?

883
01:05:44,811 --> 01:05:46,729
I would bury it in the garden.

884
01:05:46,813 --> 01:05:49,732
Swell, but this man
doesn't have a garden.

885
01:05:49,816 --> 01:05:52,234
- Oh, neither do I.
- You don't?

886
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:56,405
Well, if you had to hide it in this room,
where would you put it?

887
01:05:56,489 --> 01:05:59,241
- Up there.
- On top of that cupboard?

888
01:05:59,325 --> 01:06:02,828
You know something?
You may be right.

889
01:06:06,624 --> 01:06:10,544
Oh, I hope I don't find
any hairy little things living up here.

890
01:06:11,671 --> 01:06:14,298
Hey, there is something.
And it's heavy.

891
01:06:14,382 --> 01:06:16,759
I found it!
I found it! I found it!

you're crazy.

We won! We won!

We won! We won!
We won! We won!

895
01:06:26,561 --> 01:06:28,937
We found it!
We found it!

896
01:06:29,022 --> 01:06:30,939
- Did you find it?
- No.

897
01:06:31,024 --> 01:06:33,942
- What do you mean, no?
- The kid was yellin'.

898
01:06:34,027 --> 01:06:36,403
Up there.
It’s up there.

899
01:06:36,488 --> 01:06:39,198
Believe me,
there's nothing up there.

900
01:06:39,282 --> 01:06:41,200
Yeah?

901
01:06:43,661 --> 01:06:45,579
Oh!

902
01:06:58,009 --> 01:07:00,552
[Tex]
Oh! Jumpin' frijoles.

903
01:07:00,637 --> 01:07:02,387
It’s Herman's spare.

904
01:07:04,724 --> 01:07:08,519
- Where is he?
- He's over in my room.

905

[Water Running]

906
01:07:26,162 --> 01:07:29,081
You'd better take the boy
out in the hall.

907
01:07:36,673 --> 01:07:41,135
Oh, now, who would've done
a mean thing like that?

908
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,638
I'm not quite sure.

909
01:07:44,722 --> 01:07:46,849
Well, this ain't my room.

910
01:07:46,933 --> 01:07:48,892
Mine neither.

911
01:07:48,977 --> 01:07:52,187
Oh, the police aren't going to like
this a bit. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

912
01:07:52,272 --> 01:07:56,275
We could dry him off and take him
down the hall to his own room.

913
01:07:56,359 --> 01:07:58,735
He really doesn't look too bad.

01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:00,863
Oh, poor old Herman.

915
01:08:00,947 --> 01:08:05,117
Seems like him and good luck

01:16:18,944 --> 01:16:23,365
Now, when I was a young man, my father
expected me to go into his business.

1069
01:16:23,449 --> 01:16:26,368
Umbrella frames.
That's what he made.

1070
01:16:26,452 --> 01:16:30,538
A sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't
have the sense in those days to be sensible.

1071
01:16:30,623 --> 01:16:33,124
I suppose all this is leading somewhere.

1072
01:16:33,209 --> 01:16:36,378
Well, it led me away from umbrella frames,
for one thing.

1073
01:16:36,462 --> 01:16:39,381
But that left me without
any honest means of support.

1074
01:16:39,465 --> 01:16:41,383
What do you mean?

1075
01:16:41,467 --> 01:16:43,385
Well, in this highly competitive world...

1076
01:16:43,469 --> 01:16:46,721
when a man has no profession,
there isn't much choice...

1077
01:16:46,806 --> 01:16:50,392
so I began looking for people
who had more money than they needed...

1078
01:16:50,476 --> 01:16:52,602
including some they'd barely miss.

1079
01:16:52,687 --> 01:16:54,771
You mean you're a thief?

1080
01:16:55,898 --> 01:16:58,233
Well, that's not exactly
the term I'd have chosen...

1081
01:16:58,317 --> 01:17:02,028
but it sort of captures
the spirit of the thing.

1082
01:17:02,113 --> 01:17:05,323
I don't believe it.

1083
01:17:05,408 --> 01:17:07,951
I can't really blame you now.

1084
01:17:08,035 --> 01:17:10,912
But I do believe it.
That's what I don't believe.

1085
01:17:10,996 --> 01:17:14,332
So it's good-bye, Alexander Dyle,
welcome home, Peter Joshua.

1086
01:17:15,376 --> 01:17:17,585
Sorry. The name's Adam Canfield.

1087

- Mm-hmm.

1088
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:25,301
Wonderful. Do you realize you've had
three names in the past two days?

1089
01:17:25,386 --> 01:17:28,054
I don't even know
who I'm talking to anymore.

1090
01:17:28,139 --> 01:17:30,535
Well, the man's the same,
even if the name isn't.

1091

No, he isn't.

1092
01:17:31,434 --> 01:17:33,738
Adam Canfield is a crook,
and I want to know why.

1093
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:34,686
Well, it's simple.

1094

I like what I do. I enjoy my work.

1095
01:17:37,273 --> 01:17:39,941
There aren't many men
who love their work as much as I do.

You look around sometime.

1097
01:17:42,528 --> 01:17:45,029
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?

1098
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:48,783
- Yes, but we're divorced.
- "But we're divorced."

1099

- That's right. Now go and eat your dinner.
- Oh, I could eat a horse.

I think that's what you ordered.

1101

Don't you dare be civil with me
after leading me on like this.

- How did I lead you on?
- Oh, all that marvelous rejection.

You knew I couldn't resist it.

interested in is the money.

means more to an old pro like me...

01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:31,029
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1374
01:36:31,114 --> 01:36:34,408
Tex wrote the word "Dyle"
before he died.

1375
01:36:36,995 --> 01:36:38,912
He's the murderer, I tell you.

1376
01:36:38,997 --> 01:36:42,666
Wait a minute, Mrs. Lampert.
You'd better give that to me again.

1377
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:45,961
It was the stamps on the letter
Charles had with him on the train.

1378
01:36:46,045 --> 01:36:49,756
They were in plain view all the time,
but no one bothered to look at the envelope.

1379
01:36:49,841 --> 01:36:53,093
Mrs. Lampert, listen to me. You're not safe
as long as you have these stamps.

1380
01:36:53,177 --> 01:36:56,889
Let's see. Do you know the center garden
at the Palais Royale?

1381
01:36:56,973 --> 01:36:59,474
- Yes. The colonnade?
- Yes, by the colonnade.

1382
01:36:59,559 --> 01:37:02,502
As fast as you can get there.
Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.

1383
01:37:02,514 --> 01:37:04,521
I'm leaving right away.
Good-bye.

Where are they? Reggie! Wait!

1386
01:37:21,456 --> 01:37:24,666
So you can kill me, too? Tex is dead.
He wrote "Dyle" on the carpet.

1387
01:37:24,751 --> 01:37:28,211
- I'm not Dyle. You know that.
- But Tex didn't know it. You're a murderer.

1388
01:37:28,296 --> 01:37:30,213
Reggie, I want those stamps!

- Would you speak a little louder, please?
- I can't speak any louder.

Mr. Hamilton Bartholomew.

Mr. Bartholomew has left for the day.

You've got to get word
to him right away.

He's - He's in the center garden
of the Palais Royale near the colonnade.

Tell him I'm trapped in a phone booth
right below him in the metro station.

Yes.

There was a call for you just
now, Mr. Bartholomew.

01:42:05,364 --> 01:42:07,866
It sounded quite urgent.
A Mrs. Lampert.

1412
01:42:07,950 --> 01:42:11,036
Lampert? I don't know any Mrs. Lampert.

1413
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:14,873
She says she's trapped in a metro station
and someone's trying to kill her.

1414
01:42:14,957 --> 01:42:19,920
Trying to kill her?
Who does she think I am, the C.I.A.?

1415
01:42:20,004 --> 01:42:22,881
All right, I guess you'd better call
the French police.

01:43:14,684 --> 01:43:17,894
Mr. Bartholomew!
Mr. Bartholomew!

- Help me!
- Reggie, stop.

1418
01:43:20,815 --> 01:43:22,899
That man is Carson Dyle.

We all know Carson Dyle
is dead, Mrs. Lampert.

- Now, you're not gonna believe him.

1421
01:43:31,075 --> 01:43:33,910
Bring those stamps over here.
He's trying to trick you again.

1422
01:43:33,995 --> 01:43:37,914
[Adam]
Tex recognized him. That's why he wrote Dyle.

1423
01:43:37,999 --> 01:43:40,446
If you take him those
stamps, he'll kill you, too.

1424
01:43:40,458 --> 01:43:41,293
Mrs. Lampert...

1425
01:43:41,377 --> 01:43:45,422
if I'm who he says I am, what's preventing
me from killing you right now?

1426
01:43:45,506 --> 01:43:49,175
Because he'd have to come out to get
the stamps, and he knows he'd never make it.

1427
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:52,178
Mrs. Lampert,
he wants the money for himself.

1428
01:43:52,263 --> 01:43:54,264
That's all he's ever wanted.

1429
01:43:54,348 --> 01:43:56,606
He's with the C.I.A.
I saw him at the embassy.

1430
01:43:56,618 --> 01:43:58,101
I tell you, he's Carson Dyle.

1431
01:43:58,185 --> 01:44:00,478
That's right, Mrs. Lampert.
That's right.

Oh, I don't know who anybody is.

01:44:11,115 --> 01:44:13,033
Just trust me once more.

1436
01:44:13,117 --> 01:44:15,285
Why should I?

1437
01:44:15,369 --> 01:44:18,621
I can't think of a reason
in the world why you should.

Stop right now, Mrs. Lampert,
or I'll kill you.

You'll have to come out to get them...

01:44:30,468 --> 01:44:32,594
and I'm not likely to miss at this range.

1441
01:44:32,678 --> 01:44:35,388
Maybe not, but it takes
a lot of bullets to kill me.

1442

They left me there with five of them
in my legs and my stomach.

Mrs. Lampert, they knew I was alive,
but they left me there.

01:44:41,479 --> 01:44:44,356
I spent 10 months in a German prison camp
with nothing to stop the pain.

They left me there, Mrs. Lampert.

but they left me there.

That's why I had to kill them,
all four of them.

Please believe me. I’ll kill you, too.
It won't make any difference.

he was as big a liar as you are?

Was it my hide, or those stamps?

What a terrible thing to say.
How could you think that?

Then prove it to me.

in the morning and turn in those stamps.

first - - I heard you, I heard you.

It’s only a quarter million.

to fix their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer -

Crooked? I should think you'd be glad
to find out I'm not crooked.

You can't even be honest
about being dishonest.

get an office in this building anyway?

When did you meet him?
What time of day, I mean.

1506
01:51:49,343 --> 01:51:50,156
About 1:00.

1507
01:51:50,240 --> 01:51:53,659
The lunch hour.
Probably worked it out in advance.

1508
01:51:53,744 --> 01:51:57,079
Found an office usually left open
and moved in for the time you were here.

1509
01:51:57,164 --> 01:52:00,792
Then how do I know this is your office?

Recommending that embassy offices
be kept locked during the lunch hour.

1513
01:52:10,928 --> 01:52:13,346
Mmm. Starting with his own.

1514
01:52:13,430 --> 01:52:16,307
- Give me the stamps. Come on.
- What's your first name today?

- Brian.
- Brian Cruikshank.

1516
01:52:18,811 --> 01:52:21,312
Serves me right
if I get stuck with that one.

1517
01:52:21,396 --> 01:52:23,140
Who asked you to get
stuck with any of them?

1518
01:52:23,152 --> 01:52:24,273
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?

1519
01:52:24,358 --> 01:52:26,275
- Yes.
- But we're divorced.

1520
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:28,236
No.

1521
01:52:29,279 --> 01:52:31,239
Oh.

1522
01:52:33,033 --> 01:52:34,784
My mother. She lives in Detroit.

1523
01:52:34,868 --> 01:52:38,162
You'd like her. She'd like you, too.
Come on, give me those stamps.

1524
01:52:38,247 --> 01:52:41,457
Not until you prove to me
that you're really Brian Cruikshank.

1525
01:52:41,542 --> 01:52:44,877
One day next week I'll put it
on a marriage license. How about that?

1526
01:52:44,962 --> 01:52:46,879
Quit stalling.
I want some identification now.

1527
01:52:46,964 --> 01:52:48,444
I wouldn't lie on a license.

1528
01:52:48,456 --> 01:52:50,842
You can't prove it.
You're still trying to -

1529
01:52:50,926 --> 01:52:53,344
"Marriage license"?

1530
01:52:53,428 --> 01:52:55,805
Did you say "marriage license"?

1531
01:52:55,889 --> 01:52:58,850
Don't change the subject.
Just give me the stamps.

1532
01:52:58,934 --> 01:53:03,521
Oh, I love you, Adam, Alex, Peter, Brian,
whatever your name is.

1533
01:53:03,605 --> 01:53:05,523
Oh, I love you.

1534
01:53:05,607 --> 01:53:07,525
I hope we have a lot of boys.

1535
01:53:07,609 --> 01:53:09,527
We can name them all after you.

1536
01:53:09,611 --> 01:53:12,530
Well, before we start that,
may I have the stamps?
