00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:38,288
Now wait a minute.

00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:39,942
Wait a minute.

9
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:43,293
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

10
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:44,947
Just hold on a second, Lem.

11
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,600
Liz.

12
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:49,169
You hear me, girl?

13
00:02:58,961 --> 00:02:59,918
What you want now?

14
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:07,535
Gotta play that thing so loud?

15
00:03:07,578 --> 00:03:11,452
What you come out like this for?

16
00:03:11,495 --> 00:03:13,280
Oh, don't bother me.

17
00:03:13,323 --> 00:03:13,976
Liz.

18
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,417
Someday, I'm gonna give
that she-cat the whoppin'

19
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:22,593
she's been asking for.

20
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:23,333
Sure, you will, Dave.

21
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:24,769
Lay the law down to her.

22
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:28,773
Let her know who wears
the pants around here.

23
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:29,992
I'll be back in a minute.

24
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:34,823
Any whoopin's done
back there, I'll lay

25
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:39,480
you a jug she'll be doing it.

26
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:41,786
Come on now, Lem, and tell
us about that thing you

27
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,787
killed out there at the swamp.

28
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:43,658
Yeah, Lem.

29
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:45,225
Let's hear the rest of that.

30
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:49,185
Like I was saying, I put
five slugs into that critter

31
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,361
before it went under.

32
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:53,798
Doggonest thing I ever seen.

33
00:03:53,842 --> 00:03:56,410
Had regular arms
on it like a man.

34
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:59,108
But it was sorta
different-looking.

35
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:02,111
Had suckers on them.

36
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:07,290
Like one of them-- like one
of them octopuses things.

37
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:10,641
Oh, it was plumb awful.

38
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:13,688
Lem, you sure that
critter wasn't pink?

39
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:15,167
No.

40
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:17,126
I told you before it
was sorta gray-looking.

41
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:22,697
Well, laugh if you want.

42
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,613
But that thing weren't
nothing nature put out there.

43
00:04:25,656 --> 00:04:26,788
No, sir.

44
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:29,617
And it weren't no
freak gator neither.

45
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,315
I been poaching this
country for 40 years,

46
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:35,536
and I ain't never
seen nothing like it.

47
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:37,886
Well, too bad you
didn't bring it back.

48
00:04:37,929 --> 00:04:41,455
Steve Benton probably pay a
far bounty for whatever it was.

49
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:43,065
Bounty?

50
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:47,374
I wouldn't touch that critter
for all the money ever made.

51
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:50,594
And if you'd seen it,
you wouldn't neither.

52
00:04:50,638 --> 00:04:51,987
You better take it
easy on that stuff.

53
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,816
You looking kinda pinked.

54
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:56,600
Oh.

55
00:04:56,644 --> 00:05:00,778
I'm gonna clean my otter
lines out before morning.

56
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:03,738
Lem, I think that critter's
a ghost of one of those otters

57
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:05,261
you been poaching
all these years,

58
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,001
coming back to haunt you.

59
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:12,747
Well, if that's
so, you fellas will

60
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,662
see it right quick yourselves.

61
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:30,504

00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:00,447
like that, Liz baby.

65
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,014
I got a reputation around here.

66
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:04,755
These folks have no
respect for a man

67
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,583
who lets his woman boss him.

68
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:08,629
Next thing you know,
they'll be laughing at me,

69
00:06:08,672 --> 00:06:11,458
and they'll be telling all
the rest of the-- won't you

70
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:14,678
please listen to me, Liz baby?

71
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:15,375
Liz?

72
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:50,584
Stop looking at me like that.

73
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:52,107
I'll look at you
any way I want.

74
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,760
You're my wife.

75
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:08,863
Don't touch me.

76
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:11,082
Who do you think
you're talking to?

77
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:12,040
Don't touch me.

78
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,215
You're my wife.

79
00:07:13,258 --> 00:07:14,695
I'll touch you any
time I feel like it.

80
00:07:22,137 --> 00:07:22,964
Where you going?

81
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:30,841
Where you going?

82
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:33,278
I'm going out.

83
00:07:33,322 --> 00:07:35,280
Maybe I'll be back.

84
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:36,543
Maybe I won't.

85
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:38,719
Look, Liz baby, I
didn't mean nothing.

86
00:08:08,313 --> 00:08:09,924
Well, there was a young
one in that last trap.

87
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:10,664
I had to kill it.

88
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:12,709
Oh, poor thing.

89
00:08:12,753 --> 00:08:13,797
Told you you shouldn't
have come along.

90
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:21,805
Well, I can understand
hunting an animal,

91
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:25,026
but making it suffer
in those traps.

92
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:26,114
Horrible.

93
00:08:26,157 --> 00:08:27,637
Well, these poachers
know the swamps

94
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:29,247
like the back of their hands.

95
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,684
But I'll catch one of
them in the act some night

96
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:33,121
and put him away for six months.

97
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:34,601
In the meantime, I'll
have to be satisfied

98
00:08:34,644 --> 00:08:36,341
confiscating their trap lines.

99
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:38,518
They lose enough traps, it
won't pay them to keep trying.

100
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:40,476
Well, be careful, darling.

101
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,999
These people aren't
like other folks.

102
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:44,349
You know, they'll try
and get back at you.

103
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:45,568
Let them try.

104
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:47,788
Steve, you're a stranger here.

105
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:50,051
They've lived this
way for generations.

106
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:52,444
One man isn't gonna
change them overnight.

107
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:54,185
You're a real worrywort.

108
00:08:54,229 --> 00:08:56,231
I'm serious, Steve.

109
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:57,841
They can be dangerous.

110
00:08:57,885 --> 00:08:58,581
OK.

111
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,452
I'll be careful.

112
00:09:00,496 --> 00:09:01,323
You just stop worrying.

113
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:10,811
Oh, Steve, I love you.

114
00:09:10,854 --> 00:09:11,725
I love you so much.

115
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:17,600
[scream]

116
00:09:17,644 --> 00:09:18,688
What was that?

117
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:19,907
I don't know.

118
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,603
You get in the truck
and lock it up.

119
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:29,917
[scream]

120
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,775
Listen, Benton.

121
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:04,560
The coroner ruled that Sawyer
died in a misadventure.

122
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,127
Now as far as this
office is concerned,

123
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,258
that's the end of it.

124
00:10:07,302 --> 00:10:08,608
But, Sheriff, I
can't see why there--

125
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:10,697
Look, if Lem was killed
by anything human,

126
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,264
I wouldn't need you
to tell me my job.

127
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:15,353
But I'm not about to go
tromping through the swamp

128
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:17,660
looking for an overgrown gator.

129
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:19,706
Sawyer wasn't killed
by an alligator.

130
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:21,098
Is that so?

131
00:10:21,142 --> 00:10:22,752
Did you hear that, Morton?

132
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:25,537
Game Warden Benton says it
wasn't a gator killed Lem.

133
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:27,191
Well then, what was it?

134
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:28,628
You know so much,
go on, tell me.

135
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,412
What killed him?

136
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:32,544
Doc Greyson said the
wounds were the kind a squid

137
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:34,590
or a large octopus might cause.

138
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,809
Oh, sure.

139
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:38,159
And did Greyson
explain how a saltwater

140
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:41,684
creature happened to be 30 miles
inland, living in Clearwater?

141
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:42,685
Stranger things have happened.

142
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:43,468
I know of--

143
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:44,687
Look here, Benton.

144
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:46,950
You work for the state.

145
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:48,735
Now why don't you keep your
nose out of county business?

146
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:51,955
Is that clear enough for you?

147
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:53,783
Oh, go soak your fat head.

148
00:10:57,308 --> 00:10:58,832
What was that you said?

149
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,529
I said, go soak your fat head!

150
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:10,582
That boy's looking
for bad trouble.

151
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:12,715
And he's sure gonna get it.

152
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:13,760
You can bet on that.

153
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:27,164
So you see, the octopi uses its
suction disks to hold its prey.

154
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,906
Now in itself, the disk
will not inflict a wound.

155
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,821
Same is true of the squid.

156
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:33,736
Now both creatures
have a parrot-like beak

157
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,478
as their primary offensive
and defensive weapon.

158
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:40,177
Well, maybe the
Sheriff was right, dear.

159
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:43,964
Could be a freak or a
malformed alligator.

160
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:44,878
No.

161
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:48,098
No, I'm afraid it wasn't.

162
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:50,535
Well, where does
that leave us, Doc?

163
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:53,190
I wish I knew.

164
00:11:53,234 --> 00:11:54,714
You know, I'm beginning
to think Lem was telling

165
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:56,933
the truth in Walker's store.

166
00:11:56,977 --> 00:11:59,806
He did see something
that night, something

167
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:01,416
that had intelligence
enough to seek

168
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:02,983
him out and destroy him later.

169
00:12:03,026 --> 00:12:04,767
But Sawyer claims
to have killed

170
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:07,988
the thing he saw, put a half
a dozen rifle bullets into it.

171
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:10,120
I've seen that old
.44-40 he used.

172
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:13,167
Nothing could live after
being hit with those slugs.

173
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:17,954
Well, conceding the possibility
of one such creature,

174
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:21,958
we must also concede the
possibility of others.

175
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:25,092
Well, there's one sure
way of finding out.

176
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:26,963
Go in and search every
backwater, channel,

177
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,835
and wet spot in the swamp.

178
00:12:28,878 --> 00:12:30,619
If it's there, I'll find it.

179
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:19,146
Sure is quiet around here.

180
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,441
Did you hear something?

181
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:54,094
Yes.

182
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:02,711
Well, whatever it was,
it's not here anymore.

183

[bubbling]

184
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:10,762
Did you want some coffee?

185
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:11,502
Yeah.

186
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:12,199
Thanks, hun.

187
00:14:16,203 --> 00:14:17,900
An army could hide in
here and never be noticed.

188
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:19,902
Well, one did.

189
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:21,469
NAN: What?

190
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:24,864
The Seminoles under
Osceola in the 1830s.

191
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,953
Took the US Army two
years to round them up.

192
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:30,217
Oh, I remember reading
about Osceola in high school.

193
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:30,870
Two years.

194
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:36,440
We've only been at it two
days and I feel worn out.

195
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:39,008
Well, we might as well
keep on looking around.

196
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:12,302
Well, I guess we may as
well give up for the day.

197
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:14,087
Well, you won't get
any arguments from me.

198
00:15:58,392 --> 00:16:02,352
I'm asking you for the
last time, Dave Walker.

199
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:06,400
Will you answer me,
you dirty old man?

200
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:08,402
I ain't dirty, Liz baby.

Liz honey.

00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:14,364
Can't you think of anything
else to say, stupid?

204
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:16,018
I gotta get this order
over to Ms. Showby.

205

She's one of my
better customers.

206
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:19,152
Can't keep her waiting.

207
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:25,810
I love you, Liz baby.

208
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:27,377
Get out.

209
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:28,639
Get out, you fat pig!

210
00:16:45,482 --> 00:16:49,486
Did you, um, have
some trouble, Dave?

211
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,053
You know women, Cal.

212
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:54,535
Gotta get their hair
down every now and then.

213
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:57,364
You sure do know an
awful lot about females.

214
00:16:57,407 --> 00:16:59,627
I gotta hand it to you.

215
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,325
I can't stand here jawing, Cal.

216
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:05,546
Gotta get this order
over to Ms. Showby.

217
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:08,070
What she letting her
hair down about this time?

218
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:10,203
Well.

219
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:11,465
Ever since Lem got
hisself killed,

220
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:15,338
she wants me to sell
out and move into town.

221
00:17:15,382 --> 00:17:17,688
Don't you let her
bamboozle you, Dave.

222
00:17:17,732 --> 00:17:21,475
You keep her right
here in the store.

223
00:17:21,518 --> 00:17:25,218
After all, place wouldn't be
the same without you around.

224
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:26,175
Thanks, Cal.

225
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:27,307
I better get going.

00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,091
See you when I get back.

227
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:30,179
Yeah, I'll be around.

It's Cal, honey.

You want something, Cal?

00:18:07,477 --> 00:18:08,696
I sure do, honey.

Come on over here.

we aren't even sure exists.

What do you mean?

240
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,956
You know, we've covered
miles of back channel

241
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,785
and haven't come across anything
to support your father's

theory of an alien creature.

243
00:18:57,527 --> 00:19:01,444
Not so much as a mud print
we couldn't identify.

I know.

You're not gonna give
up, are you, Steve?

Well, I-- I can't waste anymore
time on a wild goose chase.

your father's ideas.

You're some woman, Liz.

250
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:04,681
I reckon I never met a
woman like you before.

You really like me, Cal?

00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:14,125
Oh, no.

I didn't hurt you now, did I?

255

It's just that
you're so strong.

Oh, now, I didn't mean
anything against you.

hold up a gas station.

He was so drunk, he
couldn't even run.

than a mile away.

[gunshot]

327
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:13,120
Come on.

328
00:25:13,163 --> 00:25:14,121
Come on.

329
00:25:14,164 --> 00:25:14,861
[gunshot]

330
00:25:14,904 --> 00:25:16,427
I can't go any further.

331
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:17,167
No.

332
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:18,342
Come on.

333
00:25:18,386 --> 00:25:18,995
Come on.

334
00:25:45,195 --> 00:25:46,457
Go on, run.

335
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:47,633
Run till you drop.

336
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:54,553
[gunshot]

337
00:26:08,523 --> 00:26:10,351
[gunshot]

338
00:26:12,092 --> 00:26:13,615
I'm telling you,
I can't go anymore.

339
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:14,660
I can't.

340
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:15,965
You gotta let me stop running.

341
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:16,966
Shut up.

342
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,359
[gunshot]

343
00:26:18,402 --> 00:26:20,274
[inaudible]

344
00:26:20,317 --> 00:26:22,189
I can't go on.

345
00:26:22,232 --> 00:26:22,842
Cal.

346
00:26:36,464 --> 00:26:37,900
[gunshot]

347
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,305
Come on.

348
00:26:51,348 --> 00:26:53,481
Keep going.

349
00:26:53,524 --> 00:26:56,136
Dave, please, you gotta listen.

350
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:58,181
It wasn't my fault, honest.

351
00:26:58,225 --> 00:27:00,662
She kept playing up to me every
time you turned your back.

352
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:02,664
It wasn't my fault.

353
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:05,406
You call yourself a man.

354
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:07,669
You and your muscles.

355
00:27:07,713 --> 00:27:09,671
Shut up, you tramp!

356
00:27:09,715 --> 00:27:12,065
If it wasn't for you, I
wouldn't be in this fix,

357
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:14,981
and my old friend Dave wouldn't
be doing this thing to me.

358
00:27:15,024 --> 00:27:16,722
It's all your fault.

359
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:18,071
Oh.

360
00:27:18,114 --> 00:27:19,725
Get going.

361
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:22,423
But-- but, Dave--
Dave, we been friends.

362
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:24,686
We been friends a
long time, Dave.

363
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:28,255
You wouldn't-- you wouldn't
kill an old friend, Dave?

364
00:27:28,298 --> 00:27:30,692
If you don't move, I'll
kill you where you stand.

365
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:31,693
But, Dave--

366
00:27:31,737 --> 00:27:33,695
[gunshot]

367
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:36,655
You brave, big man.

368
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:37,568
DAVE: Keep going.

369
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:42,573
I didn't mean it, Dave.

370
00:27:42,617 --> 00:27:46,752
I swear, I didn't mean it.

371
00:27:46,795 --> 00:27:51,060
Dave, they'll kill us out here.

372
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:53,410
Please, Dave.

373
00:27:53,454 --> 00:27:54,411
I'm sorry.

374
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:56,370
I'm sorry.

375
00:27:56,413 --> 00:27:57,284
I'm sorry.

376
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:02,550
Please, I'm sorry, honey.

377
00:28:02,593 --> 00:28:03,899
I'm sorry, Dave.

378
00:28:03,943 --> 00:28:04,857
I'm sorry.

379
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,510
I didn't mean it.

380
00:28:06,554 --> 00:28:07,860
I didn't mean it.

381
00:28:07,903 --> 00:28:08,730
I'm sorry.

382
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:15,563
You think you've
learned enough to stay

383
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:16,956
away from my woman, Cal?

384
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:18,740
Oh!

385
00:28:18,784 --> 00:28:20,263
Anything, Dave.

386
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:23,571
I'm [inaudible] I'll do
anything you say, Dave.

387
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:26,095
Anything.

388
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:27,662
All right.

389
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,968
Come on outta there.

390
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:30,578
[bubbling]

391
00:28:30,621 --> 00:28:32,058
Dave!
Dave!

392
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:32,798
Give me a hand.

393
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:36,845
Dave.

394
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:39,065
My god.

395
00:28:39,108 --> 00:28:39,805
Look out.

396
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:40,762
Look out.

397
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:41,545
Behind you!

398
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:44,679
[scream]

399
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:03,045
There ain't nothing
down here, sir.

400
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:06,570
Well, I'm getting
tired of this.

401
00:29:06,614 --> 00:29:07,441
Come on in, boys.

402
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,448
Well, if there was
any bodies out there,

403
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:16,624
we'd have found them.

404
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:19,018
I want some straight
answers, Walker.

405
00:29:19,061 --> 00:29:20,671
And don't give me
any more of that

406
00:29:20,715 --> 00:29:23,283
crud about monsters either.

407
00:29:23,326 --> 00:29:27,287
Where'd you hide them
after you killed them?

408
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,724
I told you the truth, Sheriff.

409
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,596
I didn't kill them.

410
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,992
I just wanted to
scare them good.

411
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:39,821
I love my Liz.

412
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:42,563
I wouldn't do
anything to hurt her.

413
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:43,869
I loved her.

414
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:45,696
Sure.

415
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,133
You loved her.

416
00:29:47,176 --> 00:29:48,656
That's why you chased
her through the swamp

417
00:29:48,699 --> 00:29:50,919
with a shotgun.

418
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:52,486
Come on, Walker.

419
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:55,097
Where'd you hide the bodies?

420
00:29:55,141 --> 00:29:56,751
Won't you believe me?

421
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,839
It was some monsters.

422
00:29:57,883 --> 00:29:59,188
They--

423
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:03,192
Take him outta here
before I lose my temper.

424
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:04,106
My Liz.

425
00:30:09,764 --> 00:30:11,766
County pay a
reward if'n someone

426
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,812
finds the body, Sheriff?

427
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:14,464
$50.

428
00:30:17,511 --> 00:30:19,382
Each?

429
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:20,035
Yeah.

430
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:28,130
You know, I never
though that of old Dave.

431
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:29,784
Course, everybody
knowed that Cal

432
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:34,528
and Liz had a hankering for each
other, everybody but old Dave.

433
00:30:34,571 --> 00:30:36,443
Darn fools.

434
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:39,359
Grappling out there in
the middle of the water.

435
00:30:39,402 --> 00:30:41,404
If'n them bodies
are still in there,

436
00:30:41,448 --> 00:30:44,668
you can bet some old bull
gator's got them stuffed

437
00:30:44,712 --> 00:30:46,888
in his cave under
the bank, letting

438
00:30:46,932 --> 00:30:50,979
them riping up for a few days.

439
00:30:51,023 --> 00:30:54,243
Yeah, well, what we
need now is some long,

440
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:56,680
Cypress poles to go in there
and pole them gator caves.

441
00:31:12,696 --> 00:31:13,741
I'm sorry, Doc.

442
00:31:13,784 --> 00:31:15,743
I can't do it.

443
00:31:15,786 --> 00:31:16,962
I'll have to do it myself.

444
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:18,267
I wouldn't want to
have to arrest you, Doc,

445
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:19,921
but I will if I find
you near the preserve

446
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:21,053
with any explosives.

447
00:31:21,096 --> 00:31:22,315
Steve.

448
00:31:22,358 --> 00:31:23,229
Sorry, Nan.

449
00:31:23,272 --> 00:31:25,013
That's the way it's gotta be.

450
00:31:25,057 --> 00:31:26,188
Steve's right, Nan.

451
00:31:26,232 --> 00:31:28,321
It's his job to
protect wildlife.

452
00:31:28,364 --> 00:31:31,237
What about human life?

453
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,979
Three people have been
killed in that game preserve.

454
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:35,154
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

455
00:31:35,197 --> 00:31:36,764
Nan, try to understand.

456
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:38,853
If I could be sure
something in the swamp

457
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,463
was responsible
for those deaths,

458
00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:42,683
I wouldn't hesitate a minute.

459
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:45,077
We've been together
the last three days.

460
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,818
We didn't see a trace
of anything unusual.

461
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:51,387
Not so much as a suggestion of
any form of life unknown to us.

462
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:52,911
Steve.

463
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:54,260
Something killed those people.

464
00:31:54,303 --> 00:31:55,957
All right, I'll admit
Sawyer's death left

465
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:57,872
a lot of questions unanswered.

466
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,179
But you can bet your bottom
dollar the other two died

467
00:32:00,222 --> 00:32:02,050
from Dave Walker's shotgun.

468
00:32:02,094 --> 00:32:03,617
Do you really believe that?

469
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,184
Figure it out, Nan.

470
00:32:05,227 --> 00:32:07,447
Walker admitted chasing his
wife and Cal into the swamps

471
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,492
after he found them together.

472
00:32:09,536 --> 00:32:10,754
He shot them, and
he tried to place

473
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:13,322
the blame on Sawyer's DTs.

474
00:32:13,366 --> 00:32:15,803
If Sawyer had told us
he'd seen purple giraffes

475
00:32:15,846 --> 00:32:18,545
with polka dot tails, Walker
would've claimed they did it.

476
00:32:18,588 --> 00:32:21,287
There's one argument
against that, Steve.

477
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,941
Dave Walker wasn't
the kind of a man

478
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:25,856
to hang himself, not even with
two murder charges against him.

479
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,423
Now I talked with
Dave less than an hour

480
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:29,077
before he killed himself.

481
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:31,471
That man was in
a state of shock.

482
00:32:31,514 --> 00:32:34,126
I've seen frightened men
before, terrified men.

483
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:36,432
But I've never seen anything
to compare with the horror

484
00:32:36,476 --> 00:32:38,521
and the fear in Walker's eyes.

485
00:32:38,565 --> 00:32:40,001
Well, he realized
what he'd done.

486
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:43,222
He killed two people,
and one his wife.

487
00:32:43,265 --> 00:32:46,051
Look, Doc, Nan and I
were all over that swamp.

488
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:48,053
Why didn't these
monsters attack us?

489
00:32:48,096 --> 00:32:49,706
I've been thinking about that.

490
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,491
They're probably
night creatures.

491
00:32:51,534 --> 00:32:52,796
They can't stand the light.

492
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,756
They stay down near the
bottom during the day.

493
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:59,107
A small charge would stun them,
bring them to the surface.

494
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:00,891
Can't buy it, Doc.

495
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:03,894
You're pig-headed,
Steve Benton.

496
00:33:03,938 --> 00:33:06,462
Stubborn and pig-headed.

497
00:33:06,506 --> 00:33:07,463
You just don't
understand, do you?

498
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:17,125
Good night, Doc.

499
00:33:54,902 --> 00:33:56,164
Right over there in them reeds.

500
00:34:10,787 --> 00:34:15,183
You know, I just can't
figure old Dave out.

501
00:34:15,227 --> 00:34:19,013
If you was caught like
Cal, what would you do?

502
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:22,495
I hadn't thought of that.

503
00:34:22,538 --> 00:34:24,801
Right over there
in them reeds is

504
00:34:24,845 --> 00:34:26,281
where that big'un used to be.

505
00:34:26,325 --> 00:34:28,022
Yeah.

506
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,198
Caught some great
catfish in that hole.

507
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:50,044
Boy.

508
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:50,740
This is sure a hot one.

509
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:56,746
Right unseasonable.

510
00:35:00,576 --> 00:35:01,795
Sure is funny.

511
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:03,275
Huh?

512
00:35:03,318 --> 00:35:04,580
Ain't you noticed anything?

513
00:35:04,624 --> 00:35:05,581
No.

514
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:06,713
What?

515
00:35:06,756 --> 00:35:08,845
We been prodding
around here all morning.

516
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:09,585
Ain't run across a single gator.

517
00:35:12,632 --> 00:35:17,115
By rights, this pool should
be crawling with them.

518
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:18,420
Sure funny.

519
00:35:18,464 --> 00:35:20,248
Yeah, that is funny.

520
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:22,207
I don't like the
looks of things.

521
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,991
Let's call it a day.

522
00:35:24,034 --> 00:35:25,471
Well now, wait a minute.

523
00:35:25,514 --> 00:35:27,212
We ain't pole the gator
holes around the bend yet.

524
00:35:27,255 --> 00:35:29,431
You do what you wanna do, boy.

525
00:35:29,475 --> 00:35:32,130
Just get me on dry
land, and right quick.

526
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:33,305
All right.

527
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:34,697
Now ain't no use
getting all head up.

528
00:35:34,741 --> 00:35:35,350
Let's go.

529
00:35:39,224 --> 00:35:41,487
You gotta quit drinking
that moonshine.

530
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,445
Eh.

531
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:45,317
That's why you're
so wrinkled and ugly.

532
00:35:49,582 --> 00:35:52,715
Coming all the way out
here on a wild goose chase.

533
00:36:00,419 --> 00:36:03,248
[scream]

534
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:47,074
[scream]

535
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:11,925
[screaming]

536
00:37:40,649 --> 00:37:42,521
We've been calling, but
there's been no answer.

537
00:37:42,564 --> 00:37:43,913
Oh, I just got back.

538
00:37:43,957 --> 00:37:45,480
What seems to be the trouble?

539
00:37:45,524 --> 00:37:46,873
Well, haven't you heard?

540
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:50,485
Old Sam Peters and Porky
Reed have disappeared.

541
00:37:50,529 --> 00:37:51,617
Come on inside.

542
00:37:57,449 --> 00:37:59,364
You know Kovis.

543
00:37:59,407 --> 00:38:00,756
Nothing would please
him more than to have

544
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,324
all the swamp people disappear.

545
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:05,152
Swamp trash, he calls them.

546
00:38:05,195 --> 00:38:06,849
I know.

547
00:38:06,893 --> 00:38:10,375
They have about as much regard
for him as he has for them.

548
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:12,725
When they're worried
enough to go to him,

549
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:14,814
you know something's wrong.

550
00:38:14,857 --> 00:38:16,468
Mrs. Reed said the
men went searching

551
00:38:16,511 --> 00:38:18,296
for Cal and Mrs.
Walker's bodies,

552
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:20,167
and they never returned.

553
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,343
Kovis says he'll get up a
search party if they don't

554
00:38:22,387 --> 00:38:26,086
show up in a couple of days.

555
00:38:26,129 --> 00:38:28,131
Doc, you and Nan take your
car and get as many volunteers

556
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:29,611
as you can.

557
00:38:29,655 --> 00:38:31,787
Tell them to meet me
at the Old Wagon Road.

558
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:35,182
I'll call Doake Evans and
have him bring his dogs.

559
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:38,316
Either they're lost or
they've had an accident.

560
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:39,055
I hope to heaven you're right.

561
00:39:44,164 --> 00:39:47,733
[barking]

562
00:40:03,705 --> 00:40:06,839
Well, they picked up
the scent, anyway.

563
00:40:06,882 --> 00:40:10,059
Dad, do you think
they'll find them?

564
00:40:10,103 --> 00:40:11,670
Only the good Lord
can answer that.

565
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:32,604
Well, at least we
know they got this far.

566
00:40:32,647 --> 00:40:33,822
All right, let's
split up into two

567
00:40:33,866 --> 00:40:35,694
parties and circle the lake.

568
00:40:35,737 --> 00:40:36,956
Keep your eyes open.

569
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:37,609
Let's move out.

570
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,435
[bubbling]

571
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:25,004
All clear.

572
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:26,658
It's clear over here.

573
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:32,620
[growling]

574
00:42:08,656 --> 00:42:09,527
All right, let's keep moving.

575
00:42:33,942 --> 00:42:35,335
Well, we can't do
anything more tonight.

576
00:42:35,378 --> 00:42:36,728
Might as well start back.

577
00:42:36,771 --> 00:42:39,557
I reckon ain't no use
hurrying now, Mr. Benton.

578
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,516
If Reed and old Sam was
alive, they'da let us known

579
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,213
with a holler or something.

580
00:42:44,257 --> 00:42:46,955
Yeah, it kinda looks that way.

581
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:48,914
You fellas notice
anything about this lake?

582
00:42:48,957 --> 00:42:50,393
I mean, the gators.

583
00:42:50,437 --> 00:42:51,133
What about them?

584
00:42:51,177 --> 00:42:52,787
They ain't here.

585
00:42:52,831 --> 00:42:56,617
Piece of water this size usually
has maybe 50, 60 big'uns around

586
00:42:56,661 --> 00:42:59,054
and a whole lotta little'uns.

587
00:42:59,098 --> 00:43:00,621
It's real unnatural.

588
00:43:00,665 --> 00:43:03,189
Well, maybe our torches
scared them away.

589
00:43:03,232 --> 00:43:04,930
Nothing scares gators.

590
00:43:04,973 --> 00:43:06,758
Nothing, animal or human.

591
00:43:10,326 --> 00:43:11,327
Well, we might as
well get outta here.

592
00:43:21,947 --> 00:43:24,471
You got something
in mind, Steve?

593
00:43:24,514 --> 00:43:28,127
I keep thinking of what
Evans said about the gators.

594
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:31,304
Nothing scares them,
animal or human.

595
00:43:31,347 --> 00:43:32,914
And yet, something
made them leave.

596
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:36,222
Maybe a-- maybe a
mineral contamination.

597
00:43:36,265 --> 00:43:38,311
Guess I better run
some water samples.

598
00:43:38,354 --> 00:43:41,923
NAN: Come on, you two,
drink your coffee.

599
00:43:41,967 --> 00:43:45,710
And supposing there
is no contamination?

600
00:43:45,753 --> 00:43:48,234
Well then, I'll send over
to Eastport for a diving rig

601
00:43:48,277 --> 00:43:50,018
and go down to look for
this monster of yours.

602
00:43:50,062 --> 00:43:52,542
No, Steve, don't
even joke like that.

603
00:43:52,586 --> 00:43:54,022
I'm not joking, Nan.

604
00:43:54,066 --> 00:43:55,371
I had some training
with an Aqua-Lung

605
00:43:55,415 --> 00:43:56,372
while I was in the Navy.

606
00:43:56,416 --> 00:43:57,722
But, Steve--

607
00:43:57,765 --> 00:43:59,680
Look, there are two
bodies we know for sure

608
00:43:59,724 --> 00:44:01,029
are down there, maybe four.

609
00:44:01,073 --> 00:44:02,378
They've got to be brought up.

610
00:44:02,422 --> 00:44:04,337
Wait a minute.

611
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,426
There are no alligators in
that part of the swamp, right?

612
00:44:06,469 --> 00:44:07,514
STEVE: So?

613
00:44:07,557 --> 00:44:10,125
No sign of any fish or snakes?

614
00:44:10,169 --> 00:44:11,344
No.

615
00:44:11,387 --> 00:44:13,999
What are you getting at, Doc?

616
00:44:14,042 --> 00:44:15,565
Well, there goes your
argument about setting off

617
00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:17,480
a dynamite charge under water.

618
00:44:17,524 --> 00:44:19,744
It'd bring the bodies
to the surface.

619
00:44:19,787 --> 00:44:21,484
Get it out of your mind, Doc.

620
00:44:21,528 --> 00:44:24,226
I'm not using any explosives
as long as there's another way.

621
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:25,619
Why must you be such a--

622
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,099
Stubborn pighead?

623
00:44:27,142 --> 00:44:28,578
NAN: Exactly.

624
00:44:28,622 --> 00:44:30,276
I'll tell you why.

625
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:31,669
Number one, there's
bound to be some aquarian

626
00:44:31,712 --> 00:44:33,279
life in that section,
even if the bigger

627
00:44:33,322 --> 00:44:36,021
forms have abandoned it.

628
00:44:36,064 --> 00:44:38,458
Explosion under water would
destroy every living thing

629
00:44:38,501 --> 00:44:41,591
and wreck what nature
took years to build up.

630
00:44:41,635 --> 00:44:43,593
Number two, I'm paid
to prevent the useless

631
00:44:43,637 --> 00:44:46,074
slaughter of wildlife.

632
00:44:46,118 --> 00:44:48,381
Number three, I'd have
to get authorization.

633
00:44:48,424 --> 00:44:49,774
And to get that authorization,
I'd have to come up

634
00:44:49,817 --> 00:44:51,950
with a heck of a good reason.

635
00:44:51,993 --> 00:44:52,646
Satisfied?

636
00:44:55,605 --> 00:44:56,563
Finish up, Dad.

637
00:44:56,606 --> 00:44:58,739
I want to go home.

638
00:44:58,783 --> 00:45:00,480
Steve.

639
00:45:00,523 --> 00:45:02,308
How long will it take to
get this diving equipment

640
00:45:02,351 --> 00:45:03,831
from Eastport?

641
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:04,745
A couple of days.

642
00:45:04,789 --> 00:45:06,921
Why?

643
00:45:06,965 --> 00:45:07,705
Oh, nothing.

644
00:45:11,665 --> 00:45:12,231
Take care of yourself, Steve.

645
00:45:20,326 --> 00:45:21,588
Well, here's hoping.

646
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:23,329
Dad.

647
00:45:23,372 --> 00:45:24,765
Can't you throw the
dynamite in from here?

648
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:26,462
No.

649
00:45:26,506 --> 00:45:27,942
I want to get it out into the
middle, in the deepest part.

650
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,732
All right.

651
00:45:59,539 --> 00:46:01,715
[groaning]

652
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:02,368
Stop!

653
00:46:54,202 --> 00:46:54,855
It should go any minute.

654
00:47:00,643 --> 00:47:03,255
[explosion]

655
00:47:50,955 --> 00:47:51,869
I just can't figure it out.

656
00:47:56,221 --> 00:47:59,354
Walker's wife, why didn't
her body come to the surface?

657
00:47:59,398 --> 00:48:00,225
I don't know.

658
00:48:03,445 --> 00:48:06,187
I think I better walk over
to the coroner's office.

659
00:48:06,231 --> 00:48:07,928
What's the matter, Mr. Benton?

660
00:48:07,972 --> 00:48:11,584
You feel awkward about arresting
my father in his own home?

661
00:48:11,627 --> 00:48:14,282
I warned him I'd arrest
him if he used dynamite.

662
00:48:14,326 --> 00:48:15,109
That's nice of you.

663
00:48:18,286 --> 00:48:19,592
Well, the autopsy
should be over by now.

664
00:48:22,682 --> 00:48:24,162
Oh, Steve.

665
00:48:24,205 --> 00:48:26,642
I thought you'd be here.

666
00:48:26,686 --> 00:48:29,732
I don't like to have
to do this, Doctor.

667
00:48:29,776 --> 00:48:31,952
Do we have time for
a cup of coffee first?

668
00:48:31,996 --> 00:48:33,388
Sure.

669
00:48:33,432 --> 00:48:34,955
-Do you mind, honey?
-No.

670
00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:35,825
I'll make some sandwiches.

671
00:48:47,576 --> 00:48:51,189
One thing is certain, for
all the good it'll do now.

672
00:48:51,232 --> 00:48:52,755
Dave Walker didn't shoot Cal.

673
00:48:55,845 --> 00:48:58,022
I'd just come from
the autopsies.

674
00:48:58,065 --> 00:49:00,111
Kovis tried to keep me out.

675
00:49:00,154 --> 00:49:02,374
But I told him I'd raise a
stink they'd smell all the way

676
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:04,202
to the capital if he did.

677
00:49:04,245 --> 00:49:05,943
Well, what killed them, Doc?

678
00:49:05,986 --> 00:49:07,640
Not drowning.

679
00:49:07,683 --> 00:49:11,470
And Cal wasn't shot either.

680
00:49:11,513 --> 00:49:15,387
Every drop of blood was
drained out of their bodies.

681
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:18,956
And they had wounds on their
throats, suction wounds,

682
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:23,047
like a-- like a gigantic
leech might make.

683
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:25,527
And there's something
even more incredible.

684
00:49:25,571 --> 00:49:28,791
Now Cal was supposed to have
been killed several days ago.

685
00:49:28,835 --> 00:49:32,752
Sam and Reed had been
missing a matter of 48 hours.

686
00:49:32,795 --> 00:49:35,276
All three of them, as far as
we know, were in that lake

687
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,148
a minimum of two days.

688
00:49:37,191 --> 00:49:40,238
Now I'd stake my
reputation as a doctor

689
00:49:40,281 --> 00:49:42,109
that Cal hadn't been dead
more than two or three

690
00:49:42,153 --> 00:49:43,589
hours when we found them.

691
00:49:43,632 --> 00:49:46,157
And the other two,
less than that.

692
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,073
First stage rigor mortis
started in during the autopsy.

693
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:49,987
But how could that be, Doc?

694
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:52,076
It's impossible.

695
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:54,687
The coroner will confirm it.

696
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:56,819
Whatever killed them
is still in that lake.

697
00:49:56,863 --> 00:49:58,691
And it's gonna take more
than dynamite to get it out.

698
00:50:01,694 --> 00:50:03,043
Concussion from
those charges would've

699
00:50:03,087 --> 00:50:04,001
killed a full grown whale.

700
00:50:07,395 --> 00:50:08,962
That explains how
Cal and the others

701
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,746
lived after they were
supposed to be drowned.

702
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:12,966
What do you mean?

703
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,837
Well, this whole region
is riddled by caves

704
00:50:14,881 --> 00:50:18,450
and caverns cut out by the
ocean thousands of years ago.

705
00:50:18,493 --> 00:50:19,755
If there are caves
above the water,

706
00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:21,931
then there must be
caves under the water.

707
00:50:21,975 --> 00:50:24,195
Go on.

708
00:50:24,238 --> 00:50:25,979
Mike and I had a
chance to fool around

709
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:29,896
with some frogman equipment
captured from the Italian Navy.

710
00:50:29,939 --> 00:50:34,292
We sort of prowled through a
sunken transport off Salerno.

711
00:50:34,335 --> 00:50:35,815
When a ship went
down, it trapped

712
00:50:35,858 --> 00:50:38,557
some air inside the hull.

713
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,907
We'd go down, come up
inside the officer's lounge,

714
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:43,301
take off our face masks,
and sort of sample some

715
00:50:43,344 --> 00:50:45,912
of the bottles floating around.

716
00:50:45,955 --> 00:50:47,392
We drove the guys crazy
trying to figure out

717
00:50:47,435 --> 00:50:50,134
how we were getting the stuff.

718
00:50:50,177 --> 00:50:52,179
You mean you think that
there's an air pocket

719
00:50:52,223 --> 00:50:53,963
or a cave underneath the lake?

720
00:50:54,007 --> 00:50:55,487
Right, gotta be.

721
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:57,402
How else could those people
have lived down there?

722
00:50:57,445 --> 00:50:59,534
Not only that, it explains
how whatever it is down

723
00:50:59,578 --> 00:51:00,883
there lived through
the concussions.

724
00:51:00,927 --> 00:51:01,536
Steve.

725
00:51:04,278 --> 00:51:06,933
Liz Walker.

726
00:51:06,976 --> 00:51:08,674
She might still be down there.

727
00:51:08,717 --> 00:51:09,327
Alive.

728
00:51:17,161 --> 00:51:21,034
[groaning]

729
00:51:26,344 --> 00:51:27,084
No.

730
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:28,302
No.

731
00:51:28,346 --> 00:51:28,998
No!

732
00:52:07,646 --> 00:52:08,516
Comfortable?

733
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,214
Yeah.

734
00:52:10,257 --> 00:52:11,954
You sure you don't want me
to go down for you, mate?

735
00:52:11,998 --> 00:52:13,608
You haven't had
one of these things

736
00:52:13,652 --> 00:52:15,567
on for a long time, while
me, every other day,

737
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:18,526
I've been playing fish.

738
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:21,703
Not this time, Mike.

739
00:52:21,747 --> 00:52:24,402
If you ask me, they oughtta
have their heads examined.

740
00:52:24,445 --> 00:52:25,794
Giant leeches.

741
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:27,753
Hmph.

742
00:52:27,796 --> 00:52:29,929
I'm willing to bet a month's
pay they don't come up

743
00:52:29,972 --> 00:52:31,974
with nothing more than excuses.

744
00:52:32,018 --> 00:52:33,498
He's crazy.

745
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:36,718
Him, the Doc, and his brat too.

746
00:52:36,762 --> 00:52:39,547
Just wait till I get on
the phone with the capital.

747
00:52:39,591 --> 00:52:41,419
I'll guarantee somebody will
wish they had kept their nose

748
00:52:41,462 --> 00:52:43,334
out of other people's business.

749
00:52:43,377 --> 00:52:44,639
I'll guarantee that.

750
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,209
Let's go, Mike.

751
00:52:53,866 --> 00:52:56,651
Steve.

752
00:52:56,695 --> 00:52:57,826
Be careful, please.

753
00:52:57,870 --> 00:52:59,219
Don't worry.

754
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,089
Mike will be ready if
anything goes wrong.

755
00:53:00,133 --> 00:53:01,569
Don't worry about Steve.

756
00:53:01,613 --> 00:53:02,962
Now if he were going
after a barracuda,

757
00:53:03,005 --> 00:53:05,921
you might have a tiny
bit to worry about.

758
00:53:05,965 --> 00:53:06,574
Ready, Mike?

759
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:57,886
No, no, please stay away.

760
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:00,759
Please.

761
00:54:00,802 --> 00:54:03,109
Not exactly inviting, is it?

762
00:54:03,152 --> 00:54:05,764
It sure isn't.

763
00:54:05,807 --> 00:54:06,373
Hold her steady, Mike.

764
00:54:28,569 --> 00:54:30,005
It'll stop anything
up to a tiger shark.

765
00:54:30,049 --> 00:54:31,355
But you gotta hit.

766
00:54:31,398 --> 00:54:33,139
Misses don't count.

767
00:54:33,182 --> 00:54:35,141
Now anything goes wrong,
just yank on the line.

768
00:54:35,184 --> 00:54:35,881
I'll be down in a hurry.

769
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:09,931
You sure you don't want me
to go down and finish it off

770
00:56:09,975 --> 00:56:11,019
for you, Steve?

771
00:56:11,063 --> 00:56:12,064
No thanks, Mike.

772
00:56:12,107 --> 00:56:15,110
I-- I think I hurt
it pretty bad.

773
00:56:15,154 --> 00:56:16,416
Careful now.

774
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:17,765
Anything hurt's 10
times as dangerous.

775
00:56:23,118 --> 00:56:25,077
He's wounded it.

776
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,296
He's gonna finish it off.

777
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,821
Does he have to go under again?

778
00:56:29,864 --> 00:56:33,128
He's got to make sure, honey.

779
00:56:33,172 --> 00:56:35,043
Where could it have come from?

780
00:56:35,087 --> 00:56:37,394
I wish I knew.

781
00:56:37,437 --> 00:56:39,396
We'll have to make some tests.

782
00:56:39,439 --> 00:56:41,180
Maybe the proximity
of Cape Canaveral's

783
00:56:41,223 --> 00:56:42,486
got something to do with it.

784
00:56:42,529 --> 00:56:44,270
The rocket station?

785
00:56:44,313 --> 00:56:47,229
Well, they use atomic energy in
the first stages of launching.

786
00:56:47,273 --> 00:56:49,623
Not all of them have
been successful.

787
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:52,060
You think that it's an animal
life that was close by, not

788
00:56:52,104 --> 00:56:54,236
close enough to be
killed, but close

789
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,325
enough to feel the effects of
a radioactive energy that--

790
00:56:56,369 --> 00:56:58,066
A mutation.

791
00:56:58,110 --> 00:57:02,984
A type of gigantism
of some common animal.

792
00:57:03,028 --> 00:57:05,770
Whatever it is, I hope
he's able to bring it up.

793
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:28,053
[moaning]

794
00:58:06,395 --> 00:58:07,658
That-- that can't be Liz.

795
00:58:13,141 --> 00:58:15,317
What could have done that?

796
00:58:15,361 --> 00:58:16,275
Look at her face.

797
00:59:40,794 --> 00:59:41,534
What's that?

798
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:44,624
Look at that thing.

799
00:59:44,668 --> 00:59:45,886
I've been around here for years.

800
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:47,148
I never saw nothing
like that before.

801
01:00:53,432 --> 01:00:55,477
There was no sign
of them this time.

802
01:00:55,521 --> 01:00:58,263
They must be licking
their wounds.

803
01:00:58,306 --> 01:01:00,178
Are you sure you used enough
stuff to do the job, Mike?

804
01:01:00,221 --> 01:01:02,136
I used 100 sticks of 40%.

805
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:04,051
Oughtta blow the
bottom right out.

806
01:01:04,095 --> 01:01:04,791
All right.

807
01:01:04,835 --> 01:01:05,923
Let her go.

808
01:01:05,966 --> 01:01:07,011
Oh, no.

809
01:01:07,054 --> 01:01:08,534
I've done enough
of your dirty work.

810
01:01:08,577 --> 01:01:09,404
Help yourself.

811
