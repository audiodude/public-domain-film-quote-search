-Where's Vicki?

1795
01:41:29,190 --> 01:41:31,920
You've come for her?

1796
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:35,190
-If I can get her back again.

1797
01:41:35,190 --> 01:41:36,160
-Good.

1798
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:37,910
Good.

1799
01:41:37,910 --> 01:41:38,610
-Daddy!

1800
01:41:38,610 --> 01:41:39,100
Daddy!

1801
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:39,590
Daddy!

1802
01:41:39,590 --> 01:41:40,290
Daddy!

1803
01:41:53,770 --> 01:41:56,690
-You're taller.

1804
01:41:56,690 --> 01:41:57,760
-Daddy.

1805
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:59,730
-What?

1806
01:41:59,730 --> 01:42:01,590
-You're not grey.

1807
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:05,210
I told everybody at
 school you'd be grey.

1808
01:42:05,210 --> 01:42:06,640
-Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

1809
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:12,390
Oh, here.

1810
01:42:12,390 --> 01:42:14,400
-Thanks.

-Claude!

1812
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:20,750
Welcome, Charles.

1813
01:42:20,750 --> 01:42:23,180
I'm very happy to see you.

1814
01:42:23,180 --> 01:42:24,470
-Thanks.

1815
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:26,230
For everything, thanks.

1816
01:42:26,230 --> 01:42:30,640
-As soon as I got your telephone
 message, I went to school

1817
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:32,620
and got Vicki.

1819
01:42:33,610 --> 01:42:36,090
Look!

1820
01:42:36,090 --> 01:42:37,080
-Uh-oh!

1821
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:38,360
Oh!

1822
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:39,060
Oh!

1823
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:46,910
It's wonderful, as usual.

1824
01:42:46,910 --> 01:42:47,610
-Daddy!

1825
01:42:47,610 --> 01:42:48,310
-What?

1826
01:42:48,310 --> 01:42:50,110
-Could we go to de Beaune?

1827
01:42:50,110 --> 01:42:52,700
Remember the rainbow train?

1828
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:53,590
-Well, I--

01:42:53,590 --> 01:42:55,180
-Oh, please?

1830
01:42:55,180 --> 01:42:55,880
Please?

1831
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:59,240
That was the very first thing
 I wanted to do when you came.

1832
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:05,420
-You've got about an hour
 till Marion comes back.

1833
01:43:05,420 --> 01:43:06,800
-I'll wear my new coat.

1834
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:07,500
-OK.

1835
01:43:11,290 --> 01:43:13,090
How is Marion?

1836
01:43:13,090 --> 01:43:13,830
-She's fine.

1837
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:18,490
-I want to know, Claude,
 how much I appreciate--

1838
01:43:18,490 --> 01:43:21,080
-Oh, I didn't do anything.

1839
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:23,600
I showed Marion your letter.

1840
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:26,830
She couldn't stop you
 from seeing Vicki.

1841
01:43:26,830 --> 01:43:30,470
-I was hoping she would
 let me have Vicki back.

1842
01:43:30,470 --> 01:43:33,310
I've got to have her, Claude.

1843
01:43:33,310 --> 01:43:34,900
I need her.

1844
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:38,900
-Yes, I think she
 needs you, too.

1845
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:39,600
VICKI: Daddy!

1846
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:40,300
Daddy!

1847
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:41,240
Hurry, Daddy!

1848
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:43,690
The hour is almost is almost up.

1849
01:43:43,690 --> 01:43:44,450
-I bought your book.

1850
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:53,400
And about Marion, if we are
 careful, if may be all right.

1851
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:38,830
-Daddy?

1852
01:44:38,830 --> 01:44:39,520
-What?

1853
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:40,460
-What's wrong?

1854
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:41,530
-Why, nothing, darling.

1855
01:44:41,530 --> 01:44:43,440
Why?

1856
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,290
-You didn't even look at me.

1857
01:44:45,290 --> 01:44:46,250
You didn't even wave at me.

1858
01:44:46,250 --> 01:44:47,060
-Oh, ho.

1859
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:49,110
Will you give me another chance?

1860
01:44:49,110 --> 01:44:50,350
You get back on that
 train and I'll--

01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:54,260
-Daddy, may I sit
 out the next ride?

1862
01:44:54,260 --> 01:44:54,960
-Oh.

1863
01:44:57,900 --> 01:45:00,360
-I'm really getting too
 old for that sort of thing.

01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:01,340
-Ha, ha.

-Oh, yes.

-I have a picture
 of her in my room.

Very much like her.

Daddy?

From de Beaune we went to

for you, Uncle Claude,

 had enough of bars.

 one drink every afternoon,

but no more.

And I take that
 drink deliberately.

 a drink won't get too big.

-Sometimes I forget and

But, well, I went to the
 Dingo to see how it looked.

 have that-- well,

 her, don't you see?

 like having Helen back.

Helen, soaked and--
 and shivering.

 remember one night.

How long are you gonna make
 me pay for that one night?

1968

What about those years Helen
 and I loved each other?

 gonna let me have Vicki?

-No.

-There's no use
 talking about it.

1982

He's not getting Vicki.

-Yes.

1987

For what he did, yes!

1988
01:52:25,250 --> 01:52:26,530
-Yes.

1989
01:52:26,530 --> 01:52:28,330
It's true.

1990
01:52:28,330 --> 01:52:34,180
He committed an unforgivable
 crime, against you, personally.

1991
01:52:34,180 --> 01:52:37,190
He's guilty of never
 knowing you loved him.

1992
01:52:37,190 --> 01:52:40,090
You found him, but
 he married Helen.

1993
01:52:40,090 --> 01:52:43,250
And yes, he's
 guilty of that, too.

1994
01:52:43,250 --> 01:52:46,910
And being guilty, of
 course, he must be punished.

1995
01:52:46,910 --> 01:52:48,640
The penalty?

1996
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:51,460
What would hurt him most.

1997
01:52:51,460 --> 01:52:54,140

 most, his little girl.

I wanted our own child.

A child out of our love, not
 out of your disappointment.
