1
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,940
There is war in this forest.

2
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,260
Not a war that's been fought,
or one that will be,

3
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,260
but any war.

4
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,700
And the enemies who struggle
here do not exist,

5
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,220
unless we call them into being.

6
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,220
This forest, then,

7
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,740
and all that happens now,
is outside History.

8
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,740
Only the unchanging
shapes of fear

9
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,220
and doubt and death

10
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,740
are from our world.

11
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,939
These soldiers that you see

12
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,940
keep our language and our time,

13
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,620
but have no other country
than the mind.

14
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,700
Do you think they're
looking for us?

15
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,220
It's one of ours alright.

16
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,860
He can't see us.

17
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,220
But maybe they saw
a plane back there.

18
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,740
There isn't much left of it to see,
less it's still burning.

19
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,220
Even if they could spot us, there isn't
anything they could do to help us here.

20
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,260
Yeah.
Six miles behind the enemy lines.

21
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,260
- Well, that's not too far.
- Not too far?

22
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,820
In those six miles there's probably
thousand of guys

23
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,259
and every one of them was taught
to shoot at uniforms like this.

24
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,740
If you're so worried about that,

25
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,940
why don't you keep your voice down?

26
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,140
I'm not worried.

27
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,460
What's going to happen,
Lieutenant?

28
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,900
Somebody around who saw
our plane go down.

29
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,420
They might be looking for us
in the woods already!

30
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,420
It'd be a lot easier if ours
knew where to start.

31
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,940
It isn't very much.

32
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,940
Too bad you fellows didn't get
your rifles out of the plane.

33
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,020
Let's see what can be done.

34
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,460
Once you understand
how a mousetrap works,

35
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,940
if you're clever enough,
you can use it as a springboard.

36
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,100
Here are the front lines.

37
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,260
From our position just
before we crashed,

38
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,740
we should be in this general area.

39
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,139
Our own lines are here

40
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,740
and we should be about here.

41
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,420
There's a river that runs East
of where we are now, I think.

42
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,620
That river cuts through the front
lines and winds up on our side.

43
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,340
Now, as I see it,

44
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,939
we could use our reconditioned
mouse trap on the river.

45
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,939
Is that your idea?
To go down the river?

46
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,940
Yes.

47
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,820
But how? How can we get down it?
I can't swim very well.

48
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,660
And Fletcher.

49
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,260
We could do it on a raft.

50
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,340
At night.

51
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,540
Well, we'll never make it
any other way.

52
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,140
It's suicide to try to walk out.

53
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,540
I wouldn't have the vaguest idea
of how and where to start.

54
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,700
This way we'd cruise through together
in a few hours and arrive in one piece.

55
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,900
- Well, by my computations...
- Your computations...

56
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,180
With your brilliant figuring
that got us here in the first place.

57
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,619
They must be somebody's pet.
It has a collar.

58
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,620
Ney, make a better watch dog.

59
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,220
Seems friendly enough.

60
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,340
We can't use a mascot
in this trip.

61
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,660
Hurry up! We don't have all day.

62
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,620
If no one has a better suggestion,
let's head for the river.

63
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,460
Some more animals might show up.

64
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,739
It's hard.
One foot fights the other.

65
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,140
- Get there, before it burns in the bushes!
- I could do it alone.

66
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,620
- Nobody's safe here.
- Are they watching me?

67
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,140
- Getting hungry.
- What's up?

68
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,420
- They're all scared.
- How hungry...

69
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,900
- Who'll they look out to later?
- Oh, the cracking in my head.

70
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,940
- I bet he was wounded.
- I don't run for no reason.

71
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,340
What's gonna hang
from the trees tonight?

72
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,420
- Hurry!
- We'll die in the woods!

73
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,940
- Don't die here!
- They're scared.

74
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,420
Alright, alright.
Lead them on!

75
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,940
After we get past this road,
the river isn't much further.

76
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,260
Mac! Get down on the road
and take a look.

77
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,939
You know?
There's nothing so refreshing

78
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,620
as an afternoon out of doors
in enemy territory.

79
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,420
It's really too bad that the sun
doesn't burn us green instead of brown.

80
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,139
Camouflage!

81
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,220
Well, if you see some strange faces
across the way, wave to them casually

82
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,940
and try to look as native as possible.

83
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,820
Lieutenant!

84
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,460
Lieutenant! Come here.
Bring your binoculars.

85
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,540
- What do you want?
- I'd like you to see something.

86
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,100
Around the river bend.

87
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,380
- What?
- I can't make out exactly what it is,

88
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,260
but I think you'll be interested.

89
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,060
Come on!

90
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,540
Over there.
See?

91
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,060
Looks like some kind
of small air strip.

92
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,500
Yes, you're right.

93
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,060
Lots of rank around.
It looks like a General!

94
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,340
Sure.

95
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,140
A General! He is a General!

96
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,940
Let's get back and help
with the raft.

97
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,540
Mac, let's go!

98
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,220
All we need now is
Huckleberry Finn.

99
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:54,460
- This oughtta see us through.
- Yeah, it doesn't look bad at all.

100
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,340
Should we make sure it floats?

101
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,140
Rafts always float.

102
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,860
It's unfortunate that we don't have
a fine bottle to christen it with.

103
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,140
We could give it a name...

104
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,140
He must have seen us!

105
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,540
If we stay here,
we'll get killed!

106
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,220
It's starting to get dark.

107
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,660
Perhaps they didn't see us.

108
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,940
But it's too dangerous
to wait here until we find out.

109
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,820
What are we gonna do?
How are we gonna get back?

110
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,820
Hurry up, let's go!

111
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,940
That plane must have landed
down that house we saw before.

112
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,620
What's the difference?

113
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,540
There must be something big
going on down there.

114
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,420
Maybe the General is having
a convention tonight.

115
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,460
We didn't see this on the way
to the river.

116
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,260
We've been running
in a new direction.

117
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,339
Whatever they're jumping,
sure smells good.

118
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,059
Like mother's own.

119
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,940
Those guns look even more jumpy
than the food does.

120
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,620
I've got an idea...

121
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,940
No matter what we do from here on,
we're much better off with some guns.

122
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,540
- You better hurry. Others maybe around.
- I'm gonna have some stew first.

123
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,540
Sidney,
better grab something to eat.

124
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,220
It may be a long time 'till our...
next feast.

125
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,660
We better eat something.

126
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,940
How's the stew, Mac?

127
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,820
Kinda cold, but cold stews
are alright.

128
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,140
Cold stew on a blazing island.

129
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,899
We've just made
a perfect definition of war, Mac.

130
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,139
That's cocky!

131
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,060
A blazing island with a tempest
of gunfire around it.

132
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,860
Perhaps if we could...

133
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,819
- Somebody must have heard us.
- Grab those guns and let's get going.

134
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,260
- Why did you have to shoot?
- Forget it. Let's move!

135
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,299
We spend our lives
running our fingers

136
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,060
down the lists and directories,

137
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,940
looking for our real names,
our permanent addresses.

138
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,340
No man is an island?

139
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,419
Perhaps that was true
a long time ago,

140
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,020
before the Ice Age.

141
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:39,300
The glaciers have melted away
and now we're all islands,

142
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,340
parts of a world made
of islands only.

143
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,460
How long are you gonna
hang around here?

144
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,820
We're in a fine mess now!

145
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,339
I'd give anything to trade places

146
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,820
with that dog we chased yesterday.

147
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,059
Seems like whenever people
get in a hole

148
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,540
they get to get jealous of dogs.

149
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,220
I admit that our prospects
aren't very cheerful.

150
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,540
But how about going back to see
if our raft is still there?

151
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:57,099
Look, if we were spotted, they'll have
a trap waiting for us when we show up.

152
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,620
It's a chance. Trying to walk out
is as risky today as it was yesterday.

153
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,420
We'll scout around the river
and make certain.

154
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,739
Then, what? Even if we find
the raft there.

155
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,380
Even if none of them
is waiting for us. Then, what?

156
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:14,420
We have to sit tight until it gets dark,
and hope that we don't have a full moon.

157
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,700
We can sing old songs
if we get restless waiting.

158
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:23,219
What's the matter, snowcoombs?
I heard that they're cannibals.

159
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,128
So even if we get caught
you're pretty safe.

160
00:17:26,154 --> 00:17:27,445
Leave me alone!

161
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,540
We may be in the woods, McClellan,
but let's try to remain civilized.

162
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,940
Yeah, I suppose you're right,
Lieutenant.

163
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,620
Anyway, there won't be many days
left to be civilized in.

164
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,420
If we stick around
these woods much longer.

165
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,220
- She'll see us!
- Shut up!

166
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,820
Don't be afraid,
we're not going to hurt you.

167
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,700
She's quite nice.
Don't you think so, boys?

168
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,220
What are we supposed to do with her now?
I've got a wife at home.

169
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,140
I'm afraid she's become
our uninvited guest.

170
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,500
I must say I've had worse guests
at better parties.

171
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:19,220
All right, Corby, all right.
Let's not forget where we are.

172
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,020
"Even if we're lost in the woods
let's try to remain civilized."

173
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,100
Well, we can't stay here.

174
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,420
- Shall we leave her fish here?
- There'll be plenty.

175
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,700
What are you gonna do with her,
Lieutenant?

176
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,100
Give me your belt.
You too, Fletcher.

177
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,860
Please, don't beat her!
She's scared like we are.

178
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,859
She doesn't even talk.

179
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,740
Get a grip on yourself, no one's gonna
punish her. I simply wanna tie her up.

180
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,300
Now give me your belt.

181
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,060
Let's hurry it up.
My arm's getting tired.

182
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,740
Be careful not to hurt her.

183
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,700
I hope she doesn't start screaming.

184
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,940
She's a pretty little thing.

185
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,779
Why don't we just leave her here
and get going?

186
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,980
Don't rush me.

187
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,740
If we can make her understand us,

188
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,300
perhaps she can tell us
whether they found the raft.

189
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,740
You speak Spanish?

190
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:48,740
I'll handle this, Sidney. I'm
quite sure she wasn't educated abroad.

191
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,140
You - see - boat?

192
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,420
Our - boat?

193
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,340
- Boat?
- Yes, that's it, boat.

194
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,700
You - see - boat?

195
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,420
Don't tell me
she doesn't understand you.

196
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,419
If she can't tell us anything,
let's let her go.

197
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:31,020
Sure, so she can run down stream
to that command post and tip our hand.

198
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,740
You kids and your ideas!

199
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,410
Maybe she was going
there in the first place.

200
00:22:38,436 --> 00:22:39,765
With the fish, you mean?

201
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,780
Sure. A general gets what he wants
for dinner, no matter what.

202
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,619
If it's fish cod or fresh strawberrys
or gold plates...

203
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,340
This is hardly the time
to become a revolutionary.

204
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:58,140
We oughtta continue to see about
the raft, but we can't let her go yet.

205
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,779
Why? What she'd do to us? If she could
understand she would have told you.

206
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,300
Mac already told you why.

207
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,820
Sidney, you'll stay here with
the young lady until we come back.

208
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,740
Here, take this.

209
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,620
You're gonna leave me here?

210
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,260
Yes, I told you,
to watch the girl.

211
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,340
You're gonna make me stay
and then not come back.

212
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,620
I know because of yesterday.

213
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,619
Keep calm, kid!
If we're not back by night

214
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,940
just get in touch with
her old man about a wedding.

215
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,860
Maybe you can settle down in a
treehouse and raise some monkeys.

216
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,763
Leave him alone, Mac.

217
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:42,245
Remember you promised
to come back, Fletcher.

218
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,459
I want you to stay here
and keep an eye on her, because

219
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,300
she may prove very useful
if the raft has been discovered.

220
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,660
We'll be back in a couple of hours.

221
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,460
Just relax.
Don't get panicky.

222
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,020
See you later, Sidney.

223
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,540
I'm really glad they let me stay.
I'm not fooling!

224
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,260
Please, don't be afraid
to like me.

225
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,620
That's why they let me stay.
They thought you'd like me.

226
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,860
The troops are gone
and I can't go home!

227
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,540
Don't do that! Don't move away,
it's not my fault!

228
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:18,260
I stopped them from beating you.
Don't scowl.

229
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:23,940
Watch, I'll make you laugh.
Look, I'm the General.

230
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,740
Hey, watch me!

231
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,820
Attention, the General is here!
Attention!

232
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,820
Glad to have you with us, Sir.

233
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,940
Quite frankly, the situation
is desperate.

234
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,260
I don't think I can
cope with it alone.

235
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,020
Isn't funny?
Isn't it?

236
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,540
Orderly, more fat fish that
the girl caught for me.

237
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,020
The General, I'm the General.

238
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,540
You don't even smile.

239
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,140
What do you want?

240
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,940
Listen.

241
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,220
I'm lost...

242
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,860
Lost...
on this terrible island.

243
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,740
If you have to hate me,

244
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,460
please, try to like me also.

245
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,740
They must have been reading
a magazine in that plane.

246
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,020
I wouldn't have believed.

247
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:21,340
Mac, better take a look
around the river bend.

248
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,100
Be careful.

249
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,340
We'll get to work
camouflaging the raft.

250
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,179
I'm a little worried about
Sidney back there with the girl.

251
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,940
I don't like the way
he's been acting.

252
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,619
You're not going soft-headed and thinking
about taking her along with us tonight?

253
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,420
You're beginning to sound
like Sidney.

254
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:50,140
No. If she can bring
three friends, perhaps.

255
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,420
But as it is, she'll remain lodged
in the forest, like we were.

256
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,340
That must be the one
that almost nailed us.

257
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,100
There he is again. It's him!

258
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,060
A cocky little king.

259
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:21,220
And me holding binoculars
like a lady watching an opera.

260
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,379
Binoculars! Soon he'll
go into his palace

261
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,540
with all his iron lap dogs.

262
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,859
If only this was a rifle sight

263
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,900
and I could make the red eye
between his ears.

264
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,300
Then he'd see McClellan!

265
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,820
Girls always love stories,

266
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,340
but it's so hard to finish
and wait for words...

267
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,140
You wanna hear more?
Do you?

268
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,060
Alright.

269
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,340
Then the spirit in magician's
power goes back to the island

270
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,540
and tells Miranda
that her father's dead.

271
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,140
The spirit sings how he's dead
at the bottom of the ocean.

272
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,859
His bones are coral,
his eyes are pearls,

273
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,220
and Miranda, her father's dead.
Dead!

274
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,940
Can't you understand anything?

275
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,940
Dead!

276
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,820
Dead!

277
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,660
Dead!

278
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,460
Now d'you understand?

279
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,220
All clear?

280
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,500
Everything's alright.

281
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,740
- I'd like to talk to you about the house.
- What house?

282
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,420
That house down there.

283
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,940
The one where we saw
that General yesterday.

284
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,540
Wait around, Mac. Right now I'd
like you to go back to Sidney.

285
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,739
I didn't like the way he was
acting when we left.

286
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,140
I'm a little concerned.

287
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,139
- But don't you think...
- Do as I say, will you?

288
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,260
As soon as we're through here
we'll join you.

289
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,740
I don't want anything
to go wrong back there.

290
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,940
Here, I brought you some water.

291
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,420
Now you like me, don't you?

292
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,660
I'll get you loose.
Just a minute.

293
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,540
You'll put your arms around me.
I know. Wait.

294
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,420
I knew you'd like me.
Just a minute.

295
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,340
Don't run away!
Don't make me stay!

296
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,340
You're going to tell the General!

297
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,020
You're gonna tell him
I made fun of him!

298
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,140
Come back,
don't tell the General!

299
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,420
I won't let you!

300
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,660
Blood... Blood...

301
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:38,740
No word. It's just broken
with blood.

302
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,340
What's the matter?

303
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,660
Where's the girl?

304
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,740
Answer me!

305
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:12,220
What have you done? Tell me
or I'll pulp you to a jelly!

306
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,540
She was tired.
She went to lie down.

307
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,540
Over there.

308
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,740
Don't annoy her, Mac.

309
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,420
Come here.

310
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:57,340
It wasn't my fault!
The magician did it. Honest!

311
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,020
Prospero the Magician!

312
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,620
First we're a bird, and then
we're an island.

313
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:10,740
Before I was a general,
and now I'm a fish!

314
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,260
Hoorah for the magicians!

315
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,420
The river...

316
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,660
It's blood, Mac!

317
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,140
Cold...
Cold...

318
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,820
I'm going for a swim.
Come on in, Mac!

319
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,020
Listen to them...
It's blood!

320
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,740
What happened?
Where's Sidney and the girl?

321
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,220
The kid must have gone
out of his head.

322
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:17,220
When I got back, he was
just laying there.

323
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,740
The girls is dead.

324
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:26,099
- Over there. He shot her.
- Where is he?

325
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,340
He's gone.

326
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,260
He yelled something about
how the magician does it.

327
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:39,620
Before he was something
and now he's a fish.

328
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,060
Before I could stop him
he ran away towards the river.

329
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:51,420
- He kept laughing and screaming.
- We can't do anything abut it now.

330
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,540
Let's move again.

331
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,740
I'm expecting the raft to be
the best way to wait 'til night.

332
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:05,620
I guess there's gonna be more
elbow room than I thought.

333
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,940
Yeah.

334
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:14,820
And I wanna talk to you about that
house down the river and the General.

335
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,060
- Kill him.
- Yeah.

336
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,140
No, I won't hear anymore about it.

337
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,220
I don't know what's gotten
into you, Mac.

338
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,340
So you saw a General. So what?

339
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,940
Raft is all set.
In a couple of hours we'll be on it.

340
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:45,740
Raft!
Raft, raft, raft!

341
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,539
Can't you see any further?
A General... Why, he...?

342
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:55,260
How many times do I have to go
over this? Must I tell you again?

343
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,900
What's one of their Generals to me?

344
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,619
He's cheap in my rate of exchange,
but our lives aren't.

345
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,860
Your rate of exchange...

346
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,220
You make me laugh!

347
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,020
- If you had any guts...
- Look, I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

348
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:18,220
Forget about the General for a minute.
What about the plane you saw?

349
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:22,740
That's right!
What about that plane?

350
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,740
We've already been over this.

351
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,740
It looks like a two seater with
that small field built in the clear.

352
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,940
One of us can take the raft down
stream to the field when it gets dark

353
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,820
and start shooting to draw
the sentries from the house.

354
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,340
The other two can plug that guy
and get away in the plane,

355
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,940
while I keep 'em busy
from the raft.

356
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,420
- You?
- Sure, me.

357
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,140
They'd get you.
You'd never make it back alive.

358
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,860
Who else could do it the way I could?
You couldn't.

359
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,659
You'd be riding home sitting down
nice and comfortable up in a cockpit

360
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,660
looking down on what's
going on. Sure.

361
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:05,940
You'll recite a few tags you picked up
and everything will be alright.

362
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:11,820
I'll just as soon make the trip
back myself, on a raft.

363
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:15,140
Do you think you have any chance
at all to get away with it alive?

364
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,140
I don't know.

365
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,420
Here I am.

366
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,260
I'm 34 years old.

367
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,220
I've never done anything
important. Nothing!

368
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,640
When this is over I'll fix
radios and washing machines.

369
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,220
- They'll see.
- Good boy, Mac. That's all.

370
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,860
I don't care if they
got a million Generals.

371
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,420
There's one two miles from here.

372
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,660
If his heist is gonna keep me from
going nuts like Sidney.

373
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:51,619
Only in a different way,
I'm gonna pull up my own heist.

374
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:55,019
But why should we?
The raft's still there.

375
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,740
As soon as it gets dark, it can take
us all back tonight.

376
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,059
If I draw 'em down to the river,
you and Fletcher can do the job

377
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,620
and get away in a plane.

378
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,140
What do you say, Fletch?

379
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,700
Well, not that I wanna seem important.

380
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:17,020
Half the trouble in the world happens
because of what some people do,

381
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,860
but I think half the good things
happen that way too.

382
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,740
If we're gonna get away with it
it would sure be better.

383
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,140
I don't know the words to say
what I mean, but...

384
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,140
This is something for me.

385
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,900
Sure, I guess we could all probably
make it back on that thing, but...

386
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,260
When you walk and walk
through the woods and

387
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:48,260
then suddenly they dangle a General
in front of you like magic,

388
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,860
and you know it's only
for this once,

389
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:55,619
you can't turn your back on 'em.
None of us asked to be here,

390
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,500
but we all have to gamble.
It's not as if we could refuse.

391
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,660
We had to gamble once we crashed,

392
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,219
a General raised the stakes
and we've been so lucky.

393
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,940
Why shouldn't we put up
a little more than we have to?

394
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,500
What are you living for anyway?

395
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,820
To make talk? Why?

396
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,540
Why is your life so precious?

397
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:22,020
Why? The only reason is
to hunt for the reason.

398
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:27,419
If I knew a decent answer to it,
I'd shout it. Probably should write...

399
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,260
- on walls with chalk.
- Do it for me.

400
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:45,340
Well, we have nothing to lose
but our futures.

401
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,340
Okay, I guess we leave you now.

402
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,900
Remember, don't start for
a half an hour.

403
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:11,260
If the plane isn't still there,
we'll have time to get back to you.

404
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,340
Don't worry, it'll be there.

405
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,860
Good luck, Mac.
See you soon.

406
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,500
Try not to get your feet wet.

407
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:27,220
- You look out for your head.
- Okay, fellow.

408
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,220
So long.

409
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:33,460
- Mac, I hope that sometime...
- You talk too much.

410
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,460
I guess we both do a little.

411
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,820
Sometimes, talk
is an indispensable medicine.

412
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,100
Yeah, but you get sicker later.

413
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,740
Good luck.

414
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:49,540
I didn't really mean what
I said before about guts.

415
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,620
Yes, you did, but only
to bother you.

416
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,860
- Take it easy, fellow.
- Yeah.

417
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:23,939
The plane's still there so I guess there
is no really good excuse to go back.

418
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,140
I guess not.

419
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,620
- Can you see?
- Hold it, hold it!

420
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,420
Yes, there he is.

421
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,620
What time is it?

422
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,220
We have about 10 minutes
before Mac begins. Let's hurry!

423
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,220
It's better...

424
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:01,940
It's better to roll up your life into
one night and one man and one gun.

425
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:07,260
It hurts too much to keep hurting
everyone else in every direction

426
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,899
and to be hurt with all
the separate hates

427
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,420
exploding day after day.

428
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,620
You can't help it.

429
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:19,220
A curse buzzes out of your mouth
with every word you say

430
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:24,420
and nobody alive can tell which
is which or what you mean.

431
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,860
Yeah.

432
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:31,940
You try door after door when
you hear voices you like behind them,

433
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,740
but the knobs come off
in your hand...

434
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,220
Go in!

435
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,019
Where did you find him?

436
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,020
One of the men did
down by the river.

437
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,460
He was very busy baying
at the moon.

438
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:23,460
Dear Proteus, aren't you
ashamed of yourself?

439
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:26,820
Staying away without leave
for two whole days.

440
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:33,820
- Have a drink, Captain.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

441
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,620
You must never, never
do that again, Proteus.

442
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:44,339
Don't you know that there are
evil spirits without bodies...

443
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:48,420
roam the forest looking
for unsuspecting dogs like you?

444
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:52,740
And that when you open your jaws
to disturb the moon

445
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,740
they leap into your mouth
and possess you?

446
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:59,140
Then you could become a spy,

447
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,020
a murderer,

448
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,820
or even a traitor.

449
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,820
Not your dog, sir.
He knows his allegiance.

450
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,540
Have you been alert, Proteus?

451
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,940
Have you detected all
the distant marchings?

452
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:19,740
Has your wet nose become aware
of all the blood on the grass?

453
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:24,700
What else can you tell us
beside your puppy dog sadness?

454
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:31,860
Wish he could tell us where those enemy
soldiers from that wrecked plane are.

455
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:35,420
They've been bothersome
for the last two days.

456
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:39,020
They'll soon grow tired
of starving and being hunted.

457
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:44,460
Even Proteus grows tired of it
after two days.

458
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:48,619
See that Lieutenant Proteus
gets something to eat.

459
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:49,820
Yes, sir.

460
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,900
Nobody's gonna cry for me later
or cheer for me now.

461
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,900
Nobody else is me.

462
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,540
I know that.

463
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:06,860
Who else but me is buried under
the chain of everything I ever did?

464
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:11,220
I didn't mean any of it.
It was all wrong.

465
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,420
Good riddance!

466
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:21,300
Oh, what a trade, him for me!

467
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:24,220
What a thing to come to
at the end,

468
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:28,820
like building a bridge
or stealing the crown jewels.

469
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,100
Thanks, General!

470
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:36,820
Thanks! I'll take the tombstone
if it's really mine.

471
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,860
Waiting...

472
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,220
Waiting to kill...

473
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,220
Waiting to heal...

474
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:02,140
Waiting to die...

475
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,460
Awaiting in the North
with four divisions.

476
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:13,820
One by one the men turned black

477
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:17,740
through waiting for
the last snowflake to dissolve.

478
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:23,740
Across the valley, our enemies
blew on their cold hands

479
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,140
until no more breath came.

480
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:33,420
Then they were dead.
And they knew it.

481
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:40,140
We were so well prepared for death

482
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:43,860
that the armistice was
a mutual disappointment.

483
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,299
Now he's in his cotton house,
taking up the cartridges on his maps,

484
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,020
full of his supper.

485
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,260
They'll get him soon.

486
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:07,260
A duck at a shooting gallery,

487
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:10,860
and I'll be the wheeler rolling
the ducks in all the bull's eyes.

488
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:17,220
I should talk. A clay pigeon
on a slow raft.

489
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:28,019
Frankly, I still become uneasy

490
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,820
when I find myself trapped

491
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,540
directing the courses
of frightened men.

492
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:37,539
I cannot quite admit
that it is I

493
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:40,820
who am creating a
slaughter in this abyss,

494
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,060
or that I left the road,

495
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:50,060
that I ordered this and that.

496
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:57,740
I'm trapped.
What is a prison for me?

497
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,860
I make a grave for others.

498
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,940
To your health, sir.

499
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,260
It's the only way to finish up.

500
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:21,460
Alone, like the North Pole
in the middle of the night.

501
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:25,140
The river is helping me
out of my life.

502
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:28,340
Sometimes, these maps...

503
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:34,619
Sometimes, as I look at these maps,

504
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:38,620
I wonder if my own grave
isn't being planned.

505
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:42,740
Here...

506
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,860
Or here...

507
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:49,740
Or here.

508
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:06,620
No more Sundays.
No more a thousand things.

509
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:10,060
I'm a little scared though.
Just a little...

510
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:13,340
like kissing my great grandma
when she was dying.

511
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:48,260
Come on out here,
bunch of half-witted cannibals!

512
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:34,940
I missed him, I think
he's only wounded!

513
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,019
We have to finish him off.

514
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:42,140
But they stopped shooting at the river.
They'll be here any minute.

515
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,700
I surrender!

516
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:16,540
Come on, let's go!

517
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,460
Please, please,
we don't have any time.

518
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:50,260
You going back?
Can I come?

519
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:53,100
I won't be any bother.

520
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:55,460
Sure, kid.

521
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:00,340
Hop on, there plenty of room.

522
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:04,340
You look tired.

523
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:06,939
Yeah.

524
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:11,420
Thanks a lot for stopping.
There was so much noise in there...

525
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:18,740
All right, Mac. You rest.
I'll be quiet.

526
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:25,140
You know?
I lost my watch!

527
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:28,220
Mac, don't close your eyes!

528
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:34,260
The trees! They're naked!
They're naked, Mac!

529
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:10,540
And what happened to the Sergeant?

530
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:14,460
I don't know, sir.

531
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:17,460
He might make it.

532
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,899
Sir, with your permission,
I'd like to go down to the river

533
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,060
and watch for him for a while.

534
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:29,700
Yes, sir, the same goes for me.

535
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:32,940
You most certainly have
the right to it if you wish.

536
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,940
Do you think he'll come back?

537
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,340
I don't know.

538
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:22,020
I'm not sure yet whether
even we've come back.

539
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,219
I think we've all travelled too far
from our own private boundaries

540
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:29,660
to be certain about
these other things anymore...

541
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:32,020
Or come back to ourselves.

542
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:36,260
Part of me is glad, but...

543
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,100
Yeah.

544
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:44,820
I'm glad in a way too.

545
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,420
And I feel free all of a sudden.

546
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:53,620
But somehow I don't want
what I wanted before.

547
00:58:56,060 --> 00:59:00,340
I know it's good. There's
nothing else I can want.

548
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:05,860
I'm all mixed up...

549
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:12,660
I wish I could want
what I wanted before.

550
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,940
Is your head bugging you?

551
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,260
No, it's something else...

552
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:21,740
What's that?

553
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:38,220
I guess I'm not...
built for this.

554
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:44,020
Nobody ever was.
It's all a trick we perform

555
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:48,220
when we'd rather not die...
immediately.

556
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:51,020
Come on!
