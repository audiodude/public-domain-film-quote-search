00:01:28,977 --> 00:01:30,760
-Morning, stranger.

3
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,822
-Hi, old timer.

4
00:01:32,822 --> 00:01:34,565
Guess you don't remember me.

5
00:01:34,565 --> 00:01:36,269
-Can't say as I do.

6
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:38,600
Yet there's something
 mighty familiar about you.

7
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,010
-Well, Jake, I guess it's a
 long time since you taught me

8
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,461
how to trap coyotes
 and ride rocks.

9
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:45,702
-Jerry Mason, as I live.

10
00:01:45,702 --> 00:01:47,096
Well, well.

11
00:01:47,096 --> 00:01:48,600
Man, how you've grown.

12
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,563
Why say, you're a regular
 mountain, ain't you?

13
00:01:50,563 --> 00:01:51,260
Heh.

14
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,199
Sit down here, and
 let's talk it over.

15
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,480
-Well, there's not
 much to tell, Jake.

16
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,326
I finished college, and--

17
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,259
-True to your
 dad's last request,

18
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:00,892
you've come to
 live with me, huh?

19
00:02:00,892 --> 00:02:01,590
Huh?

20
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,556
-That's right.

21
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:04,946
-I can't tell you how
 happy I am to see you.

22
00:02:04,946 --> 00:02:07,865
-And I'm happy to
 be here, too, Jake.

23
00:02:07,865 --> 00:02:10,704
How about the ranch, the cattle?

24
00:02:10,704 --> 00:02:12,537
-There ain't no cattle, son.

25
00:02:12,537 --> 00:02:15,684
Rustlers got most of 'em,
 and I sold what was left.

26
00:02:15,684 --> 00:02:17,726
-Well, can't we
 stock it up again

27
00:02:17,726 --> 00:02:20,187
or start in some other business?

28
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:22,617
-Itching to get to work, huh?

29
00:02:22,617 --> 00:02:26,801
Well, I was figuring on
 opening up the blacksmith shop,

30
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:31,512
but-- what do you say
 we fry us a chicken

31
00:02:31,512 --> 00:02:32,927
and gargle some coffee?

32
00:02:32,927 --> 00:02:33,734
What do you say, huh?

33
00:02:33,734 --> 00:02:36,443
-Sounds like a good idea,
 especially that chicken.

34
00:02:36,443 --> 00:02:37,887
[LAUGHTER]

35
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,472
JERRY MASON: Well, no wonder
 this horse was limping.

36
00:03:16,257 --> 00:03:17,502
COWBOY: Well, got him fixed up?

37
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:18,917
-Yep.

38
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:20,262
Your horse picked
 up a sharp rock.

39
00:03:20,262 --> 00:03:20,959
No, no.

40
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,592
There ain't no charge.

41
00:03:22,592 --> 00:03:24,824
Looks like you've been
 through plenty of water.

42
00:03:24,824 --> 00:03:25,989
-Oh, yeah.

43
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:28,459
Tried a shortcut about 12 miles
 back yonder and got stuck.

44
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:29,157
-Oh.

45
00:03:29,157 --> 00:03:31,119
-Had to come right down through
 the middle of the creek.

46
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:31,816
-Hmm.

47
00:03:31,816 --> 00:03:33,171
-And that's where he went lame.

48
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,223
-Well, good luck to you.

49
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:44,656
-Come on, Bruno.

50
00:03:49,338 --> 00:03:55,523
-Hey, I just picked this
 up at the post office.

51
00:03:55,523 --> 00:03:58,064
-I'll bet I know who it's from.

52
00:03:58,064 --> 00:03:59,518
Heh, I was right.

53
00:03:59,518 --> 00:04:00,773
Heh, heh.

54
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,905
It's from Betty. [CHUCKLES]

55
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:11,342
Well, I was right.

56
00:04:11,342 --> 00:04:12,298
It's from Betty.

57
00:04:12,298 --> 00:04:12,995
-Betty?

58
00:04:12,995 --> 00:04:15,157
-Yeah, my granddaughter.

59
00:04:15,157 --> 00:04:16,989
Didn't you know I
 had a granddaughter.

60
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:18,394
-I certainly did not.

61
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:19,848
-Yes sirree.

62
00:04:19,848 --> 00:04:21,990
I'm her only living relative.

63
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,370
I've been sending her college
 for a couple of years.

64
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,791
But she'll soon be
 here to live with me.

65
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,106
Let's she what she's got to say.

66
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:42,918
Dear Grandy, I just
 received my monthly check,

67
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:45,000
and thank you so much.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,042
I can't wait until
 school is over

69
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:49,532
so I can come and live with you.

70
00:04:49,532 --> 00:04:54,383
Gee, just three months more, and
 I'll be keeping house for you.

71
00:04:54,383 --> 00:04:58,029
Please write me a
 nice, long letter.

72
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:01,814
I do so enjoy hearing from you.

73
00:05:01,814 --> 00:05:03,637
Lovingly, Betty.

74
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,131
Heh.

75
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:07,591
She's a fine girl, Jerry.

76
00:05:07,591 --> 00:05:11,566
And I'm going to do everything
 I can to make her happy.

77
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:19,455
Well, hello Friday. [CHUCKLES]

78
00:05:19,455 --> 00:05:20,152
-Hello.

79
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:21,198
-She's the town dog.

80
00:05:21,198 --> 00:05:23,469
Everybody feeds her.

[CHUCKLES]

82
00:05:37,823 --> 00:05:41,827
-Ah, so you want to play, eh?

83
00:05:41,827 --> 00:05:43,252
Say, Jake.

84
00:05:43,252 --> 00:05:43,969
-Huh?

85
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:44,955
-Take a look.

86
00:05:44,955 --> 00:05:47,734
That's that piece of quartz that
 came out of the horse's hoof.

87
00:05:47,734 --> 00:05:50,384
It's gold.

88
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:51,679
-Say, there's a
 stringer in there

89
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:53,721
bigger than a 10-penny nail.

90
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:55,942
-If we only knew
 where it came from.

91
00:05:55,942 --> 00:05:57,516
-I do know.

92
00:05:57,516 --> 00:05:59,129
That prospector said
 he was forced down

93
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:01,450
the middle of a
 creek 12 miles out.

94
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,393
Well, there's only one
 creek out there, Jerry,

95
00:06:03,393 --> 00:06:05,564
and it'll be a cinch
 to backtrack it.

96
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:08,762
-Well, we're on our way right
 now, and if we find anything,

97
00:06:08,762 --> 00:06:10,027
I know a dog that's
 going to have

98
00:06:10,027 --> 00:06:12,328
a porterhouse steak
 and a home for life.

99
00:06:12,328 --> 00:06:13,254
-You said it.

100
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,003
-Right there's where
 he left the crick.

101
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:15,700
Wait a minute.

102
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,289
Look at that.

103
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:21,059
-Say, that's the
 real stuff, son.

104
00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:23,300
According to this pan,
 the crick's full of color.

105
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:39,148
-Hello.

106
00:07:39,148 --> 00:07:39,965
Hello, Benson.

107
00:07:39,965 --> 00:07:41,060
What can I do for you?

108
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,764
-In the first place,
 you fellows buy gold?

109
00:07:42,764 --> 00:07:43,461
-Certainly.

110
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:44,517
That's part of our business.

111
00:07:44,517 --> 00:07:46,549
-Well, weigh this up, and
 let's see what we got.

112
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:55,514
-Say, that's the pure stuff.

113
00:07:55,514 --> 00:07:56,968
It's good as I've ever seen.

114
00:08:00,893 --> 00:08:03,313
They've made a great
 strike somewhere.

115
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:23,753
Let's see.

116
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:31,961
At $16 an ounce,
 that'll come to $848.

117
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:33,535
-OK, we'll take
 that in currency,

118
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,627
if it's just the same to you.

119
00:08:35,627 --> 00:08:36,324
-OK.

120
00:08:36,324 --> 00:08:39,083
All right, Joe.

121
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,278
-Now, listen.

122
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:42,689
We expect to bring in
 many times that amount.

123
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,502
We think we've got rich strike.

124
00:08:44,502 --> 00:08:47,729
But we don't want anybody
 to know anything about it.

125
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:48,954
-But you'll tell us, won't you?

126
00:08:48,954 --> 00:08:51,026
-We're not telling
 anybody, Harris.

127
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:53,975
But when we do get ready to
 let the location be known,

128
00:08:53,975 --> 00:08:55,379
you'll be the first
 ones in on it.

129
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:56,077
-Thanks.

130
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:56,784
-Come on, Jake.

131
00:08:56,784 --> 00:08:58,537
We got to go buy a dog
 a porterhouse steak.

132
00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:05,609
-They've made a rich strike,
 and it's up to us to locate it.

133
00:09:05,609 --> 00:09:09,653
I wouldn't mind having old
 man Benson's ranch either.

134
00:09:09,653 --> 00:09:12,432
He used to run cattle.

135
00:09:12,432 --> 00:09:13,359
Huh.

136
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:17,343
Of course, he doesn't know
 it, but I got most of them.

137
00:09:41,897 --> 00:09:43,112
-You know, Jake,
 it's a good thing

138
00:09:43,112 --> 00:09:46,559
we didn't file on that claim.

139
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,790
It'd have just tipped the
 whole town off to the location

140
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,689
and confined our operation.

141
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:53,691
As it is, we can
 work the whole crick.

142
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:54,836
-Yeah.

143
00:09:54,836 --> 00:09:56,649
Your idea of
 crossing Windy Flats

144
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:58,462
and entering the town
 from the other side

145
00:09:58,462 --> 00:09:59,727
sure had them puzzled.

146
00:09:59,727 --> 00:10:00,425
Heh.

147
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:01,959
-It sure has.

148
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:04,668
They've been back-trailing
 us now for two months,

149
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:06,590
and they always get
 stuck at Windy Flats.

150
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:10,107
They think this mine's out
 in the middle of the desert.

151
00:10:10,107 --> 00:10:13,782
-Why don't we take
 a little rest, son.

152
00:10:13,782 --> 00:10:18,583
Just a few more days,
 and Betty will be coming.

153
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,576
-Well, don't you think we better
 be getting back and getting

154
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:22,159
some of this dirt
 out of our hide?

155
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:24,191
-Yeah, I reckon you're right.

156
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:28,584
You know, you want to sure
 look your best. [CHUCKLES]

Well, well.
