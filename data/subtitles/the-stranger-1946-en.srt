1
00:00:12,261 --> 00:00:13,761
The Stranger

2
00:01:24,762 --> 00:01:28,220
Leave the cell door open. That's all
there is to it. Let him escape.

3
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:30,494
In my view, it's
all very irregular.

4
00:01:30,568 --> 00:01:33,298
It might entail the most
embarrassing repercussions.

5
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,133
- Exactement.
- Certainly.

6
00:01:35,206 --> 00:01:37,037
It's a responsibility
of the first magnitude.

7
00:01:37,107 --> 00:01:39,007
I'm sorry, Mr. Wilson,
but you must...

8
00:01:39,076 --> 00:01:43,069
Oh, blast all this discussion! What
good are words? I'm sick of words.

9
00:01:43,147 --> 00:01:45,308
Hang the repercussions
and the responsibility!

10
00:01:45,382 --> 00:01:47,407
If I fail, I'm responsible.

11
00:01:47,485 --> 00:01:49,953
Leave the cell door open.
Let him escape. Let him!

12
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,351
It's our only chance!

13
00:01:51,422 --> 00:01:54,823
Let them threaten me with the bottom
pits of hell and still I insist!

14
00:01:54,892 --> 00:01:58,293
This obscenity must be destroyed!
Do you hear me? Destroyed!

15
00:02:16,113 --> 00:02:18,812
All passengers
ready to disembark.

16
00:02:19,216 --> 00:02:22,743
I am traveling for my health.
I am traveling for my health.

17
00:02:26,023 --> 00:02:28,048
Get your passports ready.

18
00:02:29,493 --> 00:02:31,461
I am traveling for my health.

19
00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:45,671
I don't understand.

20
00:02:45,743 --> 00:02:49,577
- Your business in this country, senora?
- I'm joining my husband.

21
00:02:58,055 --> 00:02:59,647
Stephen Polasky.

22
00:03:00,591 --> 00:03:01,956
- You take care of him, please.
- Si, senor.

23
00:03:02,026 --> 00:03:05,792
- Your business in this country, senor?
- I am traveling for my health.

24
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:07,091
Health?

25
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:11,259
I am traveling for my health.

26
00:03:11,335 --> 00:03:13,303
You are a
native of what country?

27
00:03:13,817 --> 00:03:15,167
Poland.

28
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:16,797
Oh, Poland.

29
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:20,103
Next, please!

30
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:09,531
Hello?

31
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:10,987
Yes.

32
00:04:13,822 --> 00:04:16,518
You haven't lost him? You're
sure you know where he's going?

33
00:04:16,592 --> 00:04:20,028
My wife is following him. He's
gone to the photographers.

34
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:23,366
Probably to get a new passport
and new instructions.

35
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:25,895
Hold it.

36
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:29,601
I wish to know the whereabouts
of Franz Kindler.

37
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:33,562
Franz Kindler.

38
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,924
There is no Franz Kindler.

39
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:40,312
Franz Kindler is
dead and cremated!

40
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:41,917
It's a command!

41
00:04:46,622 --> 00:04:51,059
I have a message for Franz
Kindler, from the all highest.

42
00:04:53,896 --> 00:04:55,955
It is forbidden.

43
00:04:56,031 --> 00:04:59,159
I command you in the
name of that authority.

44
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:14,739
You know the name he is using?

45
00:05:32,635 --> 00:05:35,627
Connecticut.

46
00:05:36,347 --> 00:05:37,943
In the United States.

47
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,233
The town of Harper.

48
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:09,193
Harper!

49
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,136
Excuse me.

50
00:06:41,261 --> 00:06:43,821
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

51
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,063
Have a nice trip?
Yes, thank you.

52
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:51,578
It's quite a store you
have here, Mr. Potter.

53
00:06:51,648 --> 00:06:54,913
That's me. We sell
about everything here.

54
00:07:22,212 --> 00:07:24,908
This suitcase.
I could leave it here?

55
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:28,781
This bag, huh? I don't
assume no responsibility.

56
00:07:28,852 --> 00:07:31,286
Just put it up on the shelf.
It'll be there when you want it.

57
00:07:31,354 --> 00:07:32,446
Thank you.

58
00:07:33,657 --> 00:07:36,524
- Can I buy this magazine?
- That'll be a dime, mister.

59
00:07:36,593 --> 00:07:38,857
What's the best hotel in town?

60
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:41,520
The best place to stay is
down at Mrs. Peabody's.

61
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:43,652
It's just down the
road here a piece.

62
00:07:50,407 --> 00:07:52,534
This way, mister.
- Yes, thank you.

63
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:02,497
- I may come in?
- Yes, of course.

64
00:10:09,612 --> 00:10:11,807
Does Mr. Charles
Rankin live here?

65
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:14,879
Yes he does, but he
isn't here right now.

66
00:10:14,951 --> 00:10:16,316
You expect him?

67
00:10:17,387 --> 00:10:19,651
- Yes, in a few minutes.
- How soon?

68
00:10:20,557 --> 00:10:23,313
- Well, a few minutes.
- Few minutes.

69
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,106
A few minutes.

70
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:30,435
I may...

71
00:10:32,745 --> 00:10:34,463
I may wait here?

72
00:10:37,715 --> 00:10:39,649
Well, yes, if you like.

73
00:10:42,353 --> 00:10:45,049
- Would you like to sit down?
- Thank you.

74
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,318
- You a friend of Mr. Rankin's?
- Yes, a friend.

75
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,626
I'm Mary Longstreet.
How do you do?

76
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,997
How do you do?

77
00:11:05,276 --> 00:11:07,301
Mr. Rankin ought to be here now.

78
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,614
Sometimes he stays after
his last class, but...

79
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:13,377
...he'll be coming straight
here today, I'm sure.

80
00:11:13,451 --> 00:11:16,215
- Because this is our wedding day.
- You're getting married?

81
00:11:16,287 --> 00:11:18,221
Yes. At 6:00.

82
00:11:18,923 --> 00:11:22,825
I know it's most unconventional,
my being here today, but...

83
00:11:22,894 --> 00:11:25,124
...I want to get
these curtains up.

84
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:33,986
When he comes, which
way does he come?

85
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:38,064
Why, from Webster Hall.

86
00:11:38,142 --> 00:11:40,712
It's the big domed building
right over there. You see?

87
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,045
I shall meet him.

88
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:45,942
Well, who shall I say that ca...

89
00:11:53,657 --> 00:11:54,851
Franz.

90
00:11:56,593 --> 00:11:58,026
It's I, Franz.

91
00:11:58,729 --> 00:12:01,755
Meinike, we mustn't be
seen talking together.

92
00:12:01,832 --> 00:12:02,958
Go back to the church.

93
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:05,627
Into the woods. Into the woods.
You understand me?

94
00:12:05,702 --> 00:12:07,294
Follow the path.

95
00:12:07,838 --> 00:12:09,635
I'll meet you there.

96
00:12:13,477 --> 00:12:16,105
- Hello, Professor Rankin.
- Hello, men.

97
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,670
- What are you up to?
- A paper chase.

98
00:12:17,748 --> 00:12:19,716
- Oh, a paper chase.
- I go ahead and lay the trail.

99
00:12:19,783 --> 00:12:22,718
You ought to have Jerry's job, Mr. Rankin,
take a little off that waistline.

100
00:12:22,786 --> 00:12:24,947
- Naw, you ought to go with us, Mr. Rankin.
- Where to?

101
00:12:25,022 --> 00:12:26,683
- The woods.
Hi, blondie.

102
00:12:26,757 --> 00:12:28,520
Oh, brother!

103
00:12:28,592 --> 00:12:31,789
The woods? Well, I'd like to.

104
00:12:31,862 --> 00:12:34,422
I'm afraid I have a couple
of things to attend to.

105
00:12:34,498 --> 00:12:36,796
Well, join us later.
We'll be out till dark.

106
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:39,233
- All right.
- Well, we'll catch up with you.

107
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:50,639
This way, fellas!

108
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:04,351
- Meinike.
- Yes. Meinike.

109
00:13:06,563 --> 00:13:08,895
- I thought...
- I had been hanged.

110
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,727
The others, but not I.

111
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,027
A dead man could not stand
face to face with you, Franz.

112
00:13:15,105 --> 00:13:16,780
Hey, Noah, wait for me!

113
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,677
You're not much changed.

114
00:13:18,991 --> 00:13:22,893
Put you back in your old uniform,
you'd look very much the same.

115
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:25,953
Franz, I am a different
man than before.

116
00:13:26,031 --> 00:13:27,589
I, too.

117
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,964
I, too, am different, Konrad.

118
00:13:30,903 --> 00:13:33,736
You know how I gathered and destroyed
every single item in Germany

119
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:36,112
and Poland that might have
served as a clue to my identity.

120
00:13:36,142 --> 00:13:38,899
Well, guess what I'll be
doing at 6:00 tonight.

121
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:42,480
Standing before a minister of the
gospel with a woman's hand in mine,

122
00:13:42,548 --> 00:13:44,982
the daughter of a Justice of the
United States Supreme Court,

123
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,176
a famous liberal.

124
00:13:46,206 --> 00:13:50,620
The girl's even good to look at.
Yes, the camouflage is perfect.

125
00:13:51,557 --> 00:13:54,219
Who would think to look for
the notorious Franz Kindler

126
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:56,193
in the sacred precincts
of the Harper school,

127
00:13:56,261 --> 00:13:59,560
surrounded by the sons of
America's first families?

128
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,326
And I'll stay hidden

129
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,683
until the day when
we strike again.

130
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:09,236
Franz, there will
be another war?

131
00:14:10,743 --> 00:14:12,030
Well, of course.

132
00:14:14,703 --> 00:14:17,441
"War is an abomination,"
sayeth the Lord.

133
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:19,541
It is to tell you
this that I am here.

134
00:14:19,618 --> 00:14:21,711
- He set me free that I might come here
- Set you free?

135
00:14:21,787 --> 00:14:24,255
- and tell all these things to you.
- Who set you free?

136
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:25,756
The all highest.

137
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,453
- You don't mean...
- I mean God.

138
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:43,336
- Franz, I am a new man since I found him.
- You, Konrad, religious?

139
00:14:43,408 --> 00:14:46,866
Franz, Franz, all doors
were opened to me.

140
00:14:46,896 --> 00:14:48,173
All doors.

141
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:51,282
It was one of God's miracles.

142
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:06,998
They freed you so you'd
lead them to me.

143
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,293
Have you been followed?

144
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:11,397
- Were you followed here?
- Yes.

145
00:15:11,427 --> 00:15:14,462
- Who followed you?
- The evil one.

146
00:15:15,192 --> 00:15:16,832
He looked like any other man.

147
00:15:16,862 --> 00:15:19,377
He was dressed like
any other man.

148
00:15:19,407 --> 00:15:21,079
He even smoked a pipe.

149
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:25,211
But I recognized him through his
disguise, and I killed him.

150
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,074
Striking from on high, down.

151
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,019
God's will be done.

152
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:35,555
You killed him, the
man with the pipe?

153
00:15:36,026 --> 00:15:37,755
The man who followed you?

154
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,259
No one else followed you?

155
00:15:49,473 --> 00:15:52,442
You must be brought
to salvation, Franz.

156
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:54,670
Confess your sins as I have.

157
00:15:55,585 --> 00:15:57,815
Proclaim your guilt.

158
00:15:57,887 --> 00:16:00,219
Only thus you can
attain salvation.

159
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,655
- You really think so, Konrad?
- It will take strength.

160
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,460
Such strength as can
come only from God.

161
00:16:11,267 --> 00:16:13,258
Kneel by me, Franz.

162
00:16:13,336 --> 00:16:17,518
And together, we will pray
to him to give you strength.

163
00:16:22,612 --> 00:16:26,435
"I have sinned against
heaven and before thee.

164
00:16:27,984 --> 00:16:30,612
"I am not worthy to
be called thy son. "

165
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:34,549
Say these words after me.

166
00:16:35,725 --> 00:16:37,488
I despair of my sins.

167
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:41,054
I despair of my sins.

168
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:45,128
Oh, God of all goodness,

169
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:51,132
- how could I ever have offended thee?
- Oh God, of all goodness.

170
00:17:01,751 --> 00:17:03,912
Hey, this way, fellas!

171
00:17:03,987 --> 00:17:05,921
Don't let him get away!

172
00:18:05,415 --> 00:18:07,645
Hey, fellas,
here's the trail!

173
00:18:07,717 --> 00:18:09,309
Hurry up!

174
00:18:16,364 --> 00:18:17,820
This way, fellas.

175
00:18:25,685 --> 00:18:28,711
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered together here

176
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:31,814
in the sight of God and in
the face of this company

177
00:18:31,892 --> 00:18:35,453
to join together this man and
this woman in holy matrimony.

178
00:18:58,351 --> 00:19:00,683
And forsaking all others,
keep thee only unto her

179
00:19:00,754 --> 00:19:02,915
so long as you both shall live?

180
00:19:04,057 --> 00:19:05,251
I will.

181
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:08,628
Mary, wilt thou have this
man for thy wedded husband,

182
00:19:08,695 --> 00:19:12,654
to live together after God's ordinance
in the holiest state of matrimony?

183
00:19:14,434 --> 00:19:16,493
Wilt thou love him, comfort him,

184
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:20,266
honor and keep him in
sickness and in health

185
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,831
and forsaking all others,
keep thee only unto him

186
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:24,877
so long as ye both shall live?

187
00:19:25,412 --> 00:19:26,504
I will.

188
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,241
- Good afternoon.
Afternoon.

189
00:19:40,648 --> 00:19:42,548
- Wedding?
- Yep.

190
00:19:42,617 --> 00:19:47,179
Judge Longstreet's daughter. He's
Supreme Court Justice, you know.

191
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,189
A bottle of aspirin, please.

192
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:53,590
Right back there, third
shelf down from the top.

193
00:19:53,661 --> 00:19:56,630
You'll see the big ones on
the left, economy size.

194
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:59,495
Have to get it yourself, mister.

195
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:01,000
Right back there.

196
00:20:02,385 --> 00:20:04,615
All your needs are
on our shelves.

197
00:20:04,687 --> 00:20:06,985
Just look around,
help yourselves.

198
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,887
Right in there, just one...
That's it, that's it.

199
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,895
Living down at Mrs. Peabody's?

200
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,293
Just a few days only.

201
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,128
Some coffee, too, please.

202
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:21,466
Or should I get it myself?

203
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:25,371
- Cafeteria style around here, mister.
That's right. Self-service.

204
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:29,644
The usual, Frank.
- Yes, that's $3 even, Mr. Todd.

205
00:20:32,882 --> 00:20:34,577
No limit on the cream?

206
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,312
Well, all the people
around here take it black.

207
00:20:43,511 --> 00:20:45,945
- The one on the right, mister.
- Oh, thank you.

208
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:51,544
- Who is Miss Longstreet marrying?
- One of the teachers down at the school.

209
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,848
A stranger in town.

210
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:55,151
I issued the license.
- Oh.

211
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:57,418
Yep. I'm town clerk.

212
00:21:03,288 --> 00:21:04,312
Checkers?

213
00:21:05,482 --> 00:21:06,813
All right.

214
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:12,014
- Town clerk, huh?
- Yep.

215
00:21:12,089 --> 00:21:14,649
Well, that must be quite
a responsibility.

216
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:18,320
Oh, town clerk runs the
town, you might say. Yep.

217
00:21:19,096 --> 00:21:21,291
We usually make it for...

218
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:23,458
Fifteen, twenty.

219
00:21:25,002 --> 00:21:28,403
We often play as high
as 25 cents the game.

220
00:21:29,306 --> 00:21:32,935
Well, that's kind of stiff for
me, but I'll take a flyer.

221
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,275
- Make a million, lose a million.
- That's the way it goes.

222
00:21:40,617 --> 00:21:42,016
My move.

223
00:21:43,687 --> 00:21:45,018
All right.

224
00:21:45,589 --> 00:21:48,683
Well, you must know just about
everybody in town here.

225
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:50,386
Not just about.

226
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,037
Know everybody.

227
00:21:52,296 --> 00:21:54,739
- Here on business?
- Uh-huh.

228
00:21:55,002 --> 00:21:55,922
My move.

229
00:22:01,438 --> 00:22:04,236
School business? No, no.

230
00:22:05,609 --> 00:22:07,236
Selling something?

231
00:22:08,812 --> 00:22:10,143
No, no.

232
00:22:13,817 --> 00:22:14,855
Buying?

233
00:22:17,034 --> 00:22:20,427
Oh, antique dealer.
They all come to Harper.

234
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:23,630
Judge Longstreet's got the best
collection in these parts.

235
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,891
- Won't do you no good, though.
- No, I don't suppose he'd sell.

236
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:33,862
Happen to know... there any
other out-of-town buyers here?

237
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:35,495
Let me see.

238
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:38,337
Come to think of it, there's a
fella come in this morning.

239
00:22:38,408 --> 00:22:40,899
- Yeah?
- Came on the same bus with you.

240
00:22:40,978 --> 00:22:42,104
Really?

241
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:46,382
Left his suitcase here.
Never did come back for it.

242
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,442
He might have been one of them.

243
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,649
Well, no.

244
00:22:52,322 --> 00:22:55,416
No, he was more
the missionary type.

245
00:22:55,492 --> 00:22:58,063
Wasn't in here but a minute.
Just looked in the phone book.

246
00:22:58,093 --> 00:23:01,662
Tiny little fella he was.
Thinish.

247
00:23:02,766 --> 00:23:04,233
Unfortunate looking.

248
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:07,527
- Hurt your head, mister?
- No, no, nothing serious.

249
00:23:07,557 --> 00:23:10,863
Oh, that's too bad.

250
00:23:15,764 --> 00:23:18,426
It's a game you got
to keep your mind on.

251
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:21,443
25 cents, please.

252
00:23:28,977 --> 00:23:32,003
- I won't pretend I'm not disappointed.
- Hello, Father.

253
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,548
Has anybody seen my
brand-new husband?

254
00:23:34,616 --> 00:23:36,743
Don't tell me he's
deserted you already?

255
00:23:36,818 --> 00:23:40,389
Yes, it looks as if, the brute.
Listen, Red, have you seen Charles?

256
00:23:40,521 --> 00:23:44,181
Well, you go find him for me. Go on.
Go on, go find Charles. Hurry up.

257
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:15,147
I've looked everywhere for him,
Mary, and I can't find him.

258
00:24:15,223 --> 00:24:17,282
I wonder where he could be.
I'm getting worried.

259
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:19,418
Are you, darling? What about?

260
00:24:19,995 --> 00:24:23,089
Charles, you've changed.

261
00:24:24,994 --> 00:24:26,787
Don't you think you'd better?

262
00:24:27,681 --> 00:24:31,146
After all, aren't we supposed to be
going on a honeymoon or something?

263
00:24:31,176 --> 00:24:32,797
Give me five minutes.

264
00:25:42,143 --> 00:25:43,872
- Hello there!
Hello.

265
00:25:46,147 --> 00:25:48,342
Was that you working
up there on the clock?

266
00:25:48,372 --> 00:25:50,509
No. No, I was just
cleaning around it.

267
00:25:50,585 --> 00:25:52,324
Oh, it's a beautiful thing.

268
00:25:52,354 --> 00:25:55,152
From what I could see out front.
Beautiful.

269
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,323
- My name's Wilson.
- Oh, I'm Longstreet. Noah Longstreet.

270
00:25:58,353 --> 00:26:00,198
- Well, I'm glad to know you.
- Mr. Wilson.

271
00:26:00,228 --> 00:26:04,961
I couldn't judge any too well out front,
but I'd say it was late 16th century.

272
00:26:05,033 --> 00:26:09,129
Probably by Habrecht of
Strasbourg, the clock.

273
00:26:09,204 --> 00:26:12,765
Oh, I wouldn't know. My brother-in-law
is going to work on it.

274
00:26:13,621 --> 00:26:15,207
Is he up there now?

275
00:26:15,277 --> 00:26:19,179
No, no, he's on his honeymoon. He plans
to work on it when he gets back.

276
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,148
Is he an expert?

277
00:26:22,217 --> 00:26:25,092
Well, yes, but it's really
more of a hobby with him.

278
00:26:25,122 --> 00:26:28,687
Really? Well, it
is with me, too.

279
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:33,152
- Honeymoon?
- Yes. He and my sister.

280
00:26:35,297 --> 00:26:38,596
He has to be back on Friday
because of the examinations.

281
00:26:40,482 --> 00:26:43,001
He's one of the
teachers at the school.

282
00:26:46,292 --> 00:26:49,035
- His name is Rankin.
- Oh.

283
00:26:53,325 --> 00:26:54,977
It's nice to be able
to show it to someone

284
00:26:55,007 --> 00:26:57,345
who knows what Revere
silver is all about.

285
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:59,944
But, personally, my
specialty is pewter.

286
00:27:00,021 --> 00:27:01,989
Oh, yes, pewter.

287
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:07,785
The Revere workmanship, although
sometimes heavy in design,

288
00:27:07,815 --> 00:27:12,209
almost invariably shows the
sign of a master craftsman.

289
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:14,753
- It is beautiful.
- Noah.

290
00:27:14,783 --> 00:27:16,894
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello, honey.

291
00:27:16,924 --> 00:27:18,913
- Hello, Mary, dear.
- Adam.

292
00:27:19,026 --> 00:27:20,363
Mr. Wilson, my daughter Mary.

293
00:27:20,393 --> 00:27:22,570
- Oh, how do you do, Mr. Wilson?
- My son-in-law, Charles Rankin.

294
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,884
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

295
00:27:23,914 --> 00:27:27,039
I hope you don't mind my
intruding on your homecoming.

296
00:27:27,069 --> 00:27:28,773
Good evening, Mary.

297
00:27:28,803 --> 00:27:30,913
- Jeff, how are you?
- Fine. You're looking good.

298
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:34,752
- Welcome home, Miss Mary, dear.
- Sara!

299
00:27:35,939 --> 00:27:39,378
- If you don't sit down, it'll get cold.
- Come on, gents.

300
00:27:40,922 --> 00:27:42,321
Well, sister, how
were the mountains?

301
00:27:42,351 --> 00:27:44,383
They were perfectly marvelous.

302
00:27:44,451 --> 00:27:45,748
- Mr. Wilson?
- Yes.

303
00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:48,287
Will you come sit over here on my
right? Jeff, your usual place.

304
00:27:48,354 --> 00:27:49,878
And, darling,
you're right there.

305
00:27:49,956 --> 00:27:52,550
You ought to see Charles on skis.
He's absolutely wonderful!

306
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:53,922
- No.
- Yes, darling, you are.

307
00:27:53,993 --> 00:27:55,392
- And I'm pretty good, too, aren't I?
- Very.

308
00:27:55,495 --> 00:27:56,519
Well, for a beginner.

309
00:27:56,596 --> 00:27:59,030
Did you remember to keep your knees
together and your apparatus in?

310
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:01,158
Yes, freshie, I did.

311
00:28:01,901 --> 00:28:05,200
Mr. Wilson here is compiling a
catalog of Paul Revere silver.

312
00:28:05,271 --> 00:28:06,363
How nice.

313
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:08,669
Mr. Wilson is also an
authority on clocks.

314
00:28:08,741 --> 00:28:10,402
Oh, really? That's
Charles' hobby, too.

315
00:28:10,477 --> 00:28:12,138
Yes, so your brother tells me.

316
00:28:12,212 --> 00:28:15,147
I understand you're going to fix
the one in the church tower.

317
00:28:15,215 --> 00:28:16,580
Well, I may try.

318
00:28:16,983 --> 00:28:19,008
Well, that's
quite an undertaking.

319
00:28:19,085 --> 00:28:21,576
Show the kind of a wife
I am, I hope he fails.

320
00:28:21,654 --> 00:28:24,976
I like Harper just the way it is,
even with a clock that doesn't run.

321
00:28:26,092 --> 00:28:28,686
Have you been in Harper
long, Mr. Wilson?

322
00:28:29,105 --> 00:28:31,991
Since Friday, a week ago.

323
00:28:32,966 --> 00:28:35,935
You lost a day. I patched
you up on Friday.

324
00:28:36,002 --> 00:28:37,367
By the way, how's the head?

325
00:28:37,437 --> 00:28:39,530
Oh, very much improved,
thanks to you, Doctor.

326
00:28:39,606 --> 00:28:42,834
You were hurt on Thursday,
remember? The day of the wedding.

327
00:28:42,864 --> 00:28:45,435
Yes, that's right.

328
00:28:45,465 --> 00:28:47,612
Wednesday I left Bangor.

329
00:28:50,543 --> 00:28:53,410
- You were hurt, Mr. Wilson?
- Oh, nothing serious.

330
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,746
Well, serious enough to raise a bump on
his head the size of a billiard ball.

331
00:28:57,817 --> 00:28:59,182
The usual door.

332
00:29:01,387 --> 00:29:05,585
It's a good thing you're back, sister.
That dog of yours has been inconsolable.

333
00:29:05,658 --> 00:29:07,558
Well, all right, Red. Wait
a minute. Here you are.

334
00:29:07,627 --> 00:29:09,595
It's for missing me. How's that?

335
00:29:09,662 --> 00:29:12,392
There, that's a good boy.
How was your meeting, Adam?

336
00:29:12,465 --> 00:29:15,901
Oh, irritating.
Foreign Policy Association.

337
00:29:15,968 --> 00:29:19,301
- I read that fellow's report.
- Standish, yes.

338
00:29:19,372 --> 00:29:21,203
I think he's full of prunes.

339
00:29:21,274 --> 00:29:24,243
Well, that's the way we
used to talk in the 1930s, Noah.

340
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,641
Standish?

341
00:29:25,711 --> 00:29:28,145
The London Times man in Berlin.

342
00:29:28,214 --> 00:29:31,650
Yes, of course, he was
quoting rumors, mostly.

343
00:29:31,717 --> 00:29:33,480
Men drilling by night,

344
00:29:33,552 --> 00:29:37,044
underground meeting
places, pagan rituals.

345
00:29:37,123 --> 00:29:40,718
- Do you believe him, Pa?
- Well, anything's possible.

346
00:29:41,796 --> 00:29:44,622
I'm sorry, sir, but I
think it's ridiculous.

347
00:29:44,697 --> 00:29:46,790
Oh, there may be some
fanatics, but...

348
00:29:46,866 --> 00:29:50,199
...no German in his right mind
can still have a taste for war.

349
00:29:52,592 --> 00:29:54,461
Do you know Germany, Mr. Rankin?

350
00:29:56,977 --> 00:29:58,357
I'm sorry, I...

351
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:03,545
...I have a way of making enemies
when I'm on that subject.

352
00:30:03,616 --> 00:30:05,433
I get pretty unpopular.

353
00:30:05,463 --> 00:30:10,816
Well, we shall consider it the objective
opinion of an objective historian.

354
00:30:11,322 --> 00:30:12,599
Historian?

355
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:16,220
A psychiatrist could
explain it better.

356
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:20,295
The German sees himself as the innocent
victim of world envy and hatred.

357
00:30:20,325 --> 00:30:25,525
Conspired against, set upon by
inferior peoples, inferior nations.

358
00:30:25,555 --> 00:30:28,104
He cannot admit to error,
much less to wrongdoing.

359
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:29,573
Not the German.

360
00:30:29,642 --> 00:30:31,803
We chose to ignore
Ethiopia and Spain.

361
00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:35,404
But we learned from our casualty lists
the price of looking the other way.

362
00:30:35,481 --> 00:30:39,317
Men of truth everywhere have come
to know for whom the bell tolled,

363
00:30:39,347 --> 00:30:41,205
but not the German.

364
00:30:41,235 --> 00:30:45,799
No, he still follows his warrior
gods, marching to Wagnerian strains,

365
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:49,519
his eyes still fixed upon the
fiery sword of Siegfried.

366
00:30:49,595 --> 00:30:52,587
And in those subterranean meeting
places that you don't believe in,

367
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:56,567
the German's dream world comes alive,
and he takes his place in shining armor

368
00:30:56,635 --> 00:30:59,954
beneath the banners of
the Teutonic Knights.

369
00:31:00,104 --> 00:31:03,664
Mankind is waiting for the
messiah, but for the German

370
00:31:03,694 --> 00:31:06,143
the messiah is not
the prince of peace.

371
00:31:07,097 --> 00:31:08,477
No, he's...

372
00:31:08,815 --> 00:31:13,111
He's another Barbarossa,
another Hitler.

373
00:31:16,285 --> 00:31:20,349
Well, then you have no
faith in the reforms

374
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,957
that are being
effected in Germany.

375
00:31:23,025 --> 00:31:24,890
I don't know, Mr. Wilson.

376
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,829
I can't believe that people can
be reformed except from within.

377
00:31:29,899 --> 00:31:32,060
The basic principles of
equality and freedom

378
00:31:32,134 --> 00:31:33,795
never have and never will
take root in Germany.

379
00:31:33,869 --> 00:31:36,895
The will to freedom has been
voiced in every other tongue.

380
00:31:36,972 --> 00:31:40,635
All men are created equal,
liberte, egalite, fraternite,

381
00:31:41,544 --> 00:31:44,035
- but in German...
- There's Marx.

382
00:31:44,113 --> 00:31:47,480
"Proletarians, unite. You have
nothing to lose but your chains. "

383
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:50,348
But Marx wasn't a
German, Marx was a Jew.

384
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:54,549
But, my dear Charles, if we concede
your argument, there is no solution.

385
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:57,618
Well, sir, once again, I differ.

386
00:31:57,693 --> 00:31:59,456
Well, what is it, then?

387
00:32:00,663 --> 00:32:02,130
Annihilation.

388
00:32:03,132 --> 00:32:05,259
Down to the last babe in arms.

389
00:32:06,836 --> 00:32:10,636
Oh, Charles, I can't imagine you're
advocating a Carthaginian peace.

390
00:32:11,507 --> 00:32:13,168
Well, as an historian,
I must remind you

391
00:32:13,242 --> 00:32:17,702
that the world hasn't had much trouble
from Carthage in the past 2,000 years.

392
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,273
Well, there
speaks our pedagogue.

393
00:32:22,518 --> 00:32:24,952
Speaking of teachers, Mr. Wilson.
- Yes, yes.

394
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,783
The faculty is coming
for tea next Tuesday.

395
00:32:26,813 --> 00:32:29,744
If you have nothing better to
do, would you like to join us?

396
00:32:30,726 --> 00:32:33,957
Oh, I'd like to, but my
work here is finished.

397
00:32:36,064 --> 00:32:38,292
I'm leaving Harper tomorrow.

398
00:32:43,706 --> 00:32:47,073
Extraordinary, isn't it, clocks
being Mr. Wilson's hobby, too?

399
00:32:47,142 --> 00:32:48,973
Yes, isn't it?

400
00:32:49,044 --> 00:32:50,875
Well, Red, how do you
like your new house?

401
00:32:50,946 --> 00:32:52,607
He loves it. Come here, Red.

402
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:54,239
I think I'll take you for
a walk. Come here, boy.

403
00:32:54,316 --> 00:32:55,510
Oh, darling, you don't
have to take him out.

404
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,176
Just let him out.
He won't run off.

405
00:32:57,206 --> 00:32:59,778
I need the walk, I'm restless.
Come on, boy.

406
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:06,928
That's good.
How are you coming along?

407
00:33:07,396 --> 00:33:11,594
I'll be in Washington tomorrow afternoon.
You were right about Rankin.

408
00:33:13,098 --> 00:33:14,726
He's above suspicion.

409
00:33:48,154 --> 00:33:49,150
Here, Red.

410
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:54,906
Red, come here.

411
00:34:34,585 --> 00:34:36,303
Give me long distance.

412
00:34:38,131 --> 00:34:40,122
I want Washington, D.C.

413
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,440
Well, who but a Nazi

414
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:59,917
would deny that Karl Marx was a
German because he was a Jew?

415
00:35:02,913 --> 00:35:04,950
I think I'll stick
around for a while.

416
00:35:37,457 --> 00:35:38,856
What is it, dear?

417
00:35:41,862 --> 00:35:44,490
Oh, I'm sorry. I was dreaming.

418
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:47,361
About that little man.

419
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,460
What little man?

420
00:35:52,673 --> 00:35:55,141
Oh, you know, dear.
I told you about him.

421
00:35:56,243 --> 00:35:58,507
He came here the day
we were married.

422
00:36:01,014 --> 00:36:03,107
Light me a cigarette, will you?

423
00:36:07,454 --> 00:36:09,979
I've never had a dream
like that before.

424
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,739
It frightened me.

425
00:36:13,712 --> 00:36:14,906
Thanks.

426
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:22,980
You know that little man
was walking all by himself

427
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,715
across a deserted city square.

428
00:36:27,626 --> 00:36:30,414
Wherever he moved,
he threw a shadow.

429
00:36:32,331 --> 00:36:34,492
But when he moved away, Charles,

430
00:36:35,167 --> 00:36:38,864
the shadow stayed there behind him
and spread out just like a carpet.

431
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:44,133
I wish you could think
who he might have been.

432
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,677
You're overtired.

433
00:36:47,613 --> 00:36:48,841
Yes, perhaps.

434
00:36:53,552 --> 00:36:55,679
Here, dear. Put
this out, will you?

435
00:37:06,632 --> 00:37:08,031
What was that?

436
00:37:12,037 --> 00:37:14,232
Why, that sounded
like Red, Charles.

437
00:37:14,958 --> 00:37:18,103
- What in the world's the matter with him?
- I put him in the cellar.

438
00:37:19,078 --> 00:37:22,275
Oh, darling, no
wonder he's howling.

439
00:37:22,348 --> 00:37:24,111
He's never been locked
up in his entire life.

440
00:37:24,183 --> 00:37:26,913
But if he's to live with
us, he must be trained.

441
00:37:26,986 --> 00:37:29,318
And at night, he will
sleep in the cellar.

442
00:37:29,388 --> 00:37:31,856
In the daytime, he'll
be kept on a leash.

443
00:37:32,703 --> 00:37:35,821
Charles, I don't believe in dogs
being treated like prisoners.

444
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:38,991
- Red's my dog.
- Please, Mary.

445
00:37:40,065 --> 00:37:41,965
I know what's best.

446
00:38:09,185 --> 00:38:12,211
Hi, there, Red. Thought you'd
gone to live with your mistress.

447
00:38:12,288 --> 00:38:15,780
Well, Mary brought him home.
Said he howls all night.

448
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:17,485
Well, fishing any
good in these parts?

449
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,755
Pretty fair. Would you
like to come along?

450
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:22,440
Well, I'm afraid I've got the
wrong clothes on, but the...

451
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:25,315
...fish probably won't mind.
Thank you.

452
00:38:34,877 --> 00:38:37,311
I'm just not lucky
today, that's all.

453
00:38:38,114 --> 00:38:41,709
- Would you like a candy bar?
- Oh, I don't mind if I do. Thank you.

454
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:45,077
All your folks like fishing?

455
00:38:45,154 --> 00:38:48,590
Oh, my dad's great.
He always brings in something.

456
00:38:48,658 --> 00:38:51,320
- Well, what about Charles?
- Charles?

457
00:38:51,394 --> 00:38:54,989
Oh, I have to call him
Mr. Rankin in school.

458
00:38:55,064 --> 00:38:57,294
I get little mixed up sometimes.

459
00:38:59,102 --> 00:39:02,299
He spends most of his time
on the clock, you know.

460
00:39:02,372 --> 00:39:04,272
Why don't you like him, Noah?

461
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:06,699
What do you mean?

462
00:39:06,776 --> 00:39:09,210
You don't like your
brother-in-law.

463
00:39:09,278 --> 00:39:12,805
It's none of my business, but
I wish you'd tell me why.

464
00:39:13,516 --> 00:39:17,008
Well, I like him well enough.

465
00:39:17,553 --> 00:39:20,317
I don't know any reason
why I shouldn't.

466
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,688
Don't tell me I'm butting
in because I know I am,

467
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:24,624
but I can't help myself.

468
00:39:25,395 --> 00:39:26,760
It's my business.

469
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:33,032
I hate bringing you into this, Noah,
but you're the only one I can turn to.

470
00:39:33,102 --> 00:39:35,502
I need your help very badly.

471
00:39:35,571 --> 00:39:36,936
Well, what is it?

472
00:39:38,074 --> 00:39:40,304
Your sister may be
in great trouble.

473
00:39:40,376 --> 00:39:43,709
I know that you're man enough for what
I'm going to ask you to do for her.

474
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,477
The truth is I'm not
really an antique dealer.

475
00:39:49,852 --> 00:39:53,185
I'm sort of a detective.

476
00:39:56,592 --> 00:39:59,356
Well, what do you want
me to do, Mr. Wilson?

477
00:40:00,396 --> 00:40:02,887
It would help me a lot if I knew
every move Charles Rankin made

478
00:40:02,965 --> 00:40:05,456
on the day of his wedding,
right up to the ceremony.

479
00:40:05,535 --> 00:40:07,628
Well, I should be able to...

480
00:40:07,703 --> 00:40:11,195
- Unless Charles realizes what I'm doing.
- I'll keep him busy.

481
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,550
Gee, Mr. Wilson,
you must be wrong.

482
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:23,823
Mary wouldn't fall in love
with that kind of a man.

483
00:40:23,896 --> 00:40:27,923
I hope I am wrong, Noah,
but that's the way it is.

484
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,525
People can't help who
they fall in love with.

485
00:40:44,805 --> 00:40:47,753
Good evening, Mr. Potter.
- Good evening, Mr. Wilson.

486
00:40:48,467 --> 00:40:50,167
- Evening, boys.
- Evening, sir.

487
00:40:52,942 --> 00:40:54,287
85 cents.

488
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:03,161
Hear you and Professor
Rankin aim to fix the clock.

489
00:41:03,191 --> 00:41:04,634
That's right.

490
00:41:17,202 --> 00:41:19,240
Figure it to tell time rightly?

491
00:41:23,255 --> 00:41:26,201
And will the angel circle
around the belfry?

492
00:41:32,798 --> 00:41:35,259
Is that a man or woman
angel, Mr. Wilson?

493
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,986
I don't know.

494
00:41:42,641 --> 00:41:45,906
Well, reckon it don't make much
difference amongst angels.

495
00:41:48,137 --> 00:41:49,272
Well!

496
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,658
Give up?

497
00:41:51,883 --> 00:41:54,184
Oh, no, no, no.
We'll play it out.

498
00:41:54,214 --> 00:41:56,719
- That's my privilege, 25 cents.
- Yeah.

499
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:01,880
Oh, by the way, did Mr. Rankin
pick up his supper this evening?

500
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,946
Nope.

501
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,951
He generally gets through
up there about now.

502
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:10,025
Yes, I know.

503
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,461
Gets dark earlier these days.

504
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,919
Our little man never did pick
up his suitcase, did he?

505
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:43,085
Nope.

506
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:45,220
- Strange.
- Ain't it, though?

507
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:50,868
I've been tempted once or twice
to look and see what's inside it.

508
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:52,334
It ain't even locked.

509
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,564
Well, it seems to me that
under the circumstances,

510
00:42:54,594 --> 00:42:56,300
that you have a perfect right.

511
00:42:56,374 --> 00:42:57,568
You do?

512
00:42:58,443 --> 00:43:01,276
Well, I wouldn't want to
do it without a witness.

513
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:02,778
- Well, that's me.
- It is?

514
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:04,678
That's all I wanted to know.

515
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:08,048
I've been trying to look in that
thing ever since it's been here.

516
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,713
I wonder what's in it?

517
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,887
Soiled linen,

518
00:43:14,826 --> 00:43:15,884
sweater,

519
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:19,463
soap, and a razor
wrapped in a towel

520
00:43:19,493 --> 00:43:22,556
with S.S. Cristobal
written across it.

521
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,932
- A pair of old shoes.
- Yeah. Yep.

522
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:30,435
- Nothing but religious pamphlets.
- Yep, that's all.

523
00:43:30,508 --> 00:43:32,100
Good evening, Mr. Potter.
- Oh.

524
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:33,837
- Oh, hello Mr. Wilson.
- Good evening.

525
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:36,402
Mr. Wilson, hi.
Good evening, Mr. Rankin.

526
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:41,379
Mr. Potter and I have been poking our
noses into somebody else's business.

527
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,817
That suitcase.

528
00:43:42,847 --> 00:43:45,651
That chap left it here and
he never did call back.

529
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,184
That's been more
than two weeks ago.

530
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:50,124
Did he say what he
was doing in Harper?

531
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:52,754
Nope. Looked in the phone book.
Didn't telephone.

532
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,798
Kind of funny looking, he was.

533
00:43:54,866 --> 00:43:57,733
Scrawny little fellow,
with big starey blue eyes.

534
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:01,397
Had a queer walk, like any second
he might break into a run.

535
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:05,540
- Did he have a foreign accent?
Why, yes, he did.

536
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,774
Not so much of an accent as
a foreign way of talking.

537
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:11,713
Do you happen to know who
he could be, Mrs. Rankin?

538
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,915
Why, why, no.

539
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,355
I was just trying to complete
your mystery for you.

540
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:25,326
Don't all foreign strangers
have to have foreign accents?

541
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,233
Mary, have you seen Red?
- Why, no.

542
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:33,532
Not since I took him home to
you a couple of days ago.

543
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,196
He's been spending all his
time out in the woods

544
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:36,797
and he doesn't even come
home for his meals.

545
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:39,240
- I thought you told me he never ran away.
- He never did.

546
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,175
Well, that's why
Noah's so anxious.

547
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:42,507
Come on, Mary.

548
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:44,747
- Good night, Mr. Wilson.
- Good night.

549
00:44:44,777 --> 00:44:46,646
- Good night, Noah.
- Good night, Mary.

550
00:45:00,834 --> 00:45:02,956
Were you able to
find out anything?

551
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:07,349
Meinike did go to
Rankin's house.

552
00:45:07,379 --> 00:45:09,518
And your sister did see him.

553
00:45:10,466 --> 00:45:12,814
- Did Mary say so?
- She started to.

554
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,904
Now your sister is a
fine woman, Noah,

555
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,177
but she must find out the
kind of man she's married to.

556
00:45:19,836 --> 00:45:21,360
You don't know Mary.

557
00:45:21,438 --> 00:45:24,464
She wouldn't listen to anything
against him, much less believe...

558
00:45:24,541 --> 00:45:27,874
Noah, we must arrange it so
that she finds out for herself.

559
00:45:28,445 --> 00:45:29,810
You understand?

560
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:32,278
Yes.

561
00:45:32,349 --> 00:45:35,216
One thing's certain. She knows
nothing now, nothing at all.

562
00:45:35,285 --> 00:45:39,346
Except that he didn't want her to admit
having seen someone she did see.

563
00:45:40,957 --> 00:45:44,940
I'd give something to know what
explanation he's making right now.

564
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:47,186
I was a student in Geneva.

565
00:45:48,276 --> 00:45:49,868
There was a girl.

566
00:45:51,579 --> 00:45:55,606
The night before I was to leave,
we went out on the lake together.

567
00:45:56,419 --> 00:45:58,541
She told me unless I
promised to marry her,

568
00:45:58,571 --> 00:46:00,847
she'd never return to shore.

569
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:06,452
Well, I thought she was
joking, naturally, but...

570
00:46:07,762 --> 00:46:09,059
...she wasn't.

571
00:46:10,465 --> 00:46:13,366
Before I could stop her,
she stood up in the boat.

572
00:46:18,173 --> 00:46:22,542
Well, I dived in after
her, but it was too late.

573
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:23,975
She was gone.

574
00:46:24,045 --> 00:46:27,811
Only one person knew we were on
the lake together, her brother.

575
00:46:28,416 --> 00:46:30,145
He knew I hadn't
murdered her, but he...

576
00:46:30,218 --> 00:46:34,848
...he told me he'd be willing to call
it an accident for compensation.

577
00:46:34,923 --> 00:46:37,721
I gave him all I had
and left Switzerland.

578
00:46:37,792 --> 00:46:39,726
As the years went by,

579
00:46:39,794 --> 00:46:43,355
I allowed myself to believe that
the dead past really was dead.

580
00:46:44,532 --> 00:46:45,794
And then,

581
00:46:47,091 --> 00:46:50,123
on our wedding day, Mary,
he appeared again.

582
00:46:50,605 --> 00:46:53,267
Her brother, the little man.

583
00:46:56,611 --> 00:46:59,273
I gave him all the money
I have in the world.

584
00:47:01,282 --> 00:47:03,182
And he went away again.

585
00:47:04,835 --> 00:47:06,181
Oh, darling.

586
00:47:07,455 --> 00:47:09,218
You should have told me,

587
00:47:09,709 --> 00:47:14,210
and not carried this awful
thing around by yourself.

588
00:47:17,006 --> 00:47:19,862
You're a very wonderful
person, Mary.

589
00:47:19,934 --> 00:47:21,868
I love you very much.

590
00:47:27,772 --> 00:47:29,171
Oh, Charles.

591
00:47:33,672 --> 00:47:36,826
But... why didn't he go
back for his things?

592
00:47:39,177 --> 00:47:40,303
Well,

593
00:47:41,913 --> 00:47:46,077
I suppose once he had money,
he could afford better.

594
00:47:47,052 --> 00:47:49,316
Darling, I'm terribly nervous.

595
00:47:49,388 --> 00:47:53,188
I think I'll work up in the
clock alone tonight, by myself.

596
00:47:53,258 --> 00:47:54,885
It will calm me.

597
00:47:56,561 --> 00:47:59,462
- You understand, don't you?
- Of course I understand.

598
00:48:01,366 --> 00:48:04,927
- Shall I walk you home?
- No, dear, there's no need for that.

599
00:48:08,273 --> 00:48:10,366
- It's pretty late.
- That's all right.

600
00:48:10,442 --> 00:48:12,933
In Harper, there's
nothing to be afraid of.

601
00:48:17,482 --> 00:48:18,779
I love you.

602
00:48:33,889 --> 00:48:35,686
Poor old Red.

603
00:48:35,758 --> 00:48:37,953
He heard my whistle, I'll bet.

604
00:48:38,027 --> 00:48:39,927
He couldn't bark or anything.

605
00:48:41,397 --> 00:48:43,797
He just crawled
this far and died.

606
00:48:45,067 --> 00:48:48,264
- Why do you think he died?
- Let's go and find out.

607
00:49:00,549 --> 00:49:02,847
That's young
Longstreet's dog, Red.

608
00:49:02,918 --> 00:49:05,011
Looks like he's dead to me.

609
00:49:05,087 --> 00:49:08,250
They're taking him up to
Doctor Lawrence's office.

610
00:49:08,324 --> 00:49:10,214
Would you know
anything about it?

611
00:49:10,244 --> 00:49:12,894
Wonder what in the world's
the matter with him.

612
00:49:13,662 --> 00:49:14,993
Checkers?

613
00:49:16,298 --> 00:49:17,697
No. No, thanks.

614
00:49:18,934 --> 00:49:20,595
That Coke's a nickel.

615
00:49:24,173 --> 00:49:25,765
Thanks, Mr. Rankin.

616
00:49:36,919 --> 00:49:38,216
Oh, Doctor,

617
00:49:39,121 --> 00:49:42,181
how long could the dog have lived
with that amount of poison in him?

618
00:49:42,258 --> 00:49:44,749
Oh, not more than a
minute or so, I'd say.

619
00:49:46,462 --> 00:49:48,123
Well, then, Red must
have been poisoned

620
00:49:48,153 --> 00:49:50,796
within a few hundred yards of
where you found him, Noah.

621
00:49:52,368 --> 00:49:54,768
And the latter part
of the distance,

622
00:49:55,671 --> 00:49:58,504
he must have been moving
slower and slower.

623
00:50:02,411 --> 00:50:04,345
Thank you very much, Doctor.

624
00:50:04,413 --> 00:50:05,880
Thanks, Jeff.

625
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:09,441
Mr. Peabody,
would you please get

626
00:50:09,471 --> 00:50:12,248
that magazine rack in,
and hurry up about it?

627
00:50:12,321 --> 00:50:14,050
Yes, Mr. Potter.

628
00:50:14,824 --> 00:50:17,019
Hurry up about it.
Move along and...

629
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:20,928
Afternoon, Mr. Wilson.
Afternoon, Noah.

630
00:50:20,996 --> 00:50:23,760
Bring them right in there,
will you, Mr. Peabody?

631
00:50:36,979 --> 00:50:39,311
What does the law say about
this kind of murder?

632
00:50:39,381 --> 00:50:41,747
Is it the same as killing a man?

633
00:50:43,385 --> 00:50:45,979
It ought to be.
It's just as bad.

634
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:50,185
Forepaw's muddy, no mud on hind.

635
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,308
Dry leaves mixed with the mud.

636
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:58,110
Red must have been digging
somewhere in the woods.

637
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:00,679
Have you any idea
what for, Mr. Wilson?

638
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:08,753
A body, I think. Meinike's.

639
00:51:08,783 --> 00:51:10,299
The little man.

640
00:51:12,179 --> 00:51:13,231
Then...

641
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:29,547
- You just caught me.
- Anything wrong?

642
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:31,519
Wrong? Oh, you mean,
closing up like this?

643
00:51:31,549 --> 00:51:33,419
- Yeah.
- Just going on a search.

644
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,219
- What you after?
- A can of machine oil.

645
00:51:35,249 --> 00:51:37,317
- What search?
- For the body.

646
00:51:37,347 --> 00:51:40,886
The state police deputized half the town.
Just reach up there, fourth shelf.

647
00:51:40,916 --> 00:51:43,660
One misses the news up
in the clock tower.

648
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:45,098
What body are they
searching for?

649
00:51:45,128 --> 00:51:47,830
My bet is it's the fellow
that left his bags here.

650
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:50,634
Scrawny little duck.
Unhappy looking.

651
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,538
I knew he'd come to a bad end.

652
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,942
That oil will be
15 cents, mister.

653
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:58,913
Well, sir, I'll just put
it on your account.

654
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,592
Oh, Sara told me
you were up here.

655
00:52:12,788 --> 00:52:14,380
Why are you packing?

656
00:52:14,457 --> 00:52:17,949
- Are we going somewhere?
- We aren't, dearest. I am.

657
00:52:19,528 --> 00:52:21,052
What are you talking about?

658
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:24,391
As a rule, men leave their wives
because they don't love them, but...

659
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:27,760
...I must leave
you because I do.

660
00:52:27,837 --> 00:52:31,312
Oh, you won't object once you know
the kind of man you've married.

661
00:52:36,078 --> 00:52:39,536
But you are the man I've married,
and that's all that matters.

662
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:43,142
Darling, I meant it when I
said for better or for worse.

663
00:52:44,153 --> 00:52:45,518
Even to...

664
00:52:46,589 --> 00:52:48,079
To killing Red?

665
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:55,096
You couldn't have.

666
00:52:58,702 --> 00:53:00,561
It was an accident.

667
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:02,499
No, I meant to kill him.

668
00:53:03,339 --> 00:53:04,863
Murder can be a chain, Mary,

669
00:53:04,893 --> 00:53:07,773
one link leading to another
until it circles your neck.

670
00:53:09,879 --> 00:53:13,940
Red was digging at the
grave of the man I killed.

671
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:16,245
Yes, your little man.

672
00:53:17,901 --> 00:53:19,678
You killed him?

673
00:53:20,923 --> 00:53:22,481
With these hands.

674
00:53:23,819 --> 00:53:26,420
The same hands that have
held you close to me.

675
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:29,086
Now are you satisfied
to let me go?

676
00:53:30,032 --> 00:53:32,660
Why? Why did you do it?

677
00:53:32,735 --> 00:53:36,171
I'd have given him all I had, but
his dreams were far grander.

678
00:53:36,238 --> 00:53:38,706
He knew that your
father was well-to-do.

679
00:53:38,736 --> 00:53:41,845
He knew that Justice Longstreet would
be glad to protect his daughter

680
00:53:41,875 --> 00:53:45,343
from any scandal by paying
a few thousand dollars.

681
00:53:46,315 --> 00:53:48,749
Oh, Mary, I should
have gone away

682
00:53:48,779 --> 00:53:52,185
and lost myself in a world where
he could never find me, but...

683
00:53:53,955 --> 00:53:57,389
I loved you, and I was weak.

684
00:53:58,931 --> 00:54:00,190
Darling,

685
00:54:02,898 --> 00:54:05,230
if one of us goes,
we'll both go.

686
00:54:06,202 --> 00:54:09,569
You would have shared half
my trouble if I'd had any.

687
00:54:10,641 --> 00:54:15,044
Charles, what is there to
connect you with that man?

688
00:54:18,082 --> 00:54:20,016
Nothing, actually.

689
00:54:20,084 --> 00:54:22,518
You're the only one
that knows I knew him.

690
00:54:23,354 --> 00:54:26,949
Well, then, you need have no fear,
if I'm the only one who can speak.

691
00:54:27,025 --> 00:54:30,290
But, Mary, in failing to speak,

692
00:54:31,729 --> 00:54:33,822
you become part of the crime.

693
00:54:34,432 --> 00:54:36,593
But I'm already a part of it

694
00:54:37,535 --> 00:54:39,560
because I'm a part of you.

695
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,801
But you shudder at the
first touch of my hands

696
00:54:44,876 --> 00:54:47,208
as though it was the
touch of death.

697
00:54:48,548 --> 00:54:49,810
It's nerves.

698
00:54:50,783 --> 00:54:53,551
Hold me close, Charles.
Hold me close.

699
00:54:57,331 --> 00:54:59,296
Mr. Peabody, go back to
town with the Sheriff

700
00:54:59,326 --> 00:55:00,817
- and open up the coroner's office.
Yes, sir.

701
00:55:00,847 --> 00:55:02,861
I knew darn well
it was the same fellow.

702
00:55:02,936 --> 00:55:04,927
Course he's changed some.

703
00:55:05,005 --> 00:55:06,802
Being buried in the
earth does it.

704
00:55:07,374 --> 00:55:09,416
- Evening, Mr. Wilson.
- Good evening, Mr. Potter.

705
00:55:09,446 --> 00:55:11,444
- Evening, Noah.
- Evening, Mr. Potter.

706
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,078
A mess, ain't it?

707
00:55:14,648 --> 00:55:15,945
What do we do about Mary?

708
00:55:16,016 --> 00:55:18,746
We can't leave her alone
with him now that we know.

709
00:55:18,819 --> 00:55:20,426
Well, she realizes now that

710
00:55:20,456 --> 00:55:23,554
whatever story he told her
about Meinike was false.

711
00:55:25,726 --> 00:55:30,425
Noah, I think your sister should
be ready to hear the truth.

712
00:55:34,535 --> 00:55:35,763
Charles.

713
00:55:37,371 --> 00:55:39,669
Will they make me
look at the body?

714
00:55:41,308 --> 00:55:43,173
I shouldn't think so.

715
00:55:44,745 --> 00:55:46,713
Because I couldn't do it.

716
00:55:47,214 --> 00:55:49,114
I mean, I don't think I could.

717
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:52,913
See, I've never seen
a dead person. I...

718
00:55:58,692 --> 00:56:02,560
- How many are you having to tea, Mary?
- Twenty-eight altogether, I think, dear.

719
00:56:02,629 --> 00:56:04,119
You didn't eat
nothing at dinner.

720
00:56:04,198 --> 00:56:05,961
- Isn't that rather a lot?
- You'll be fainting again, Miss Mary.

721
00:56:05,991 --> 00:56:08,365
- Twenty-eight, with just you and Sara?
- No.

722
00:56:08,435 --> 00:56:10,494
Oh, we'll manage all right.

723
00:56:14,241 --> 00:56:16,334
- But suppose I should...
- Should what?

724
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:19,311
I don't know. Only now I'm terrified
of seeing anybody or being seen.

725
00:56:19,341 --> 00:56:22,679
Mary, you must get tight
hold of yourself.

726
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:25,045
If you're determined to go
through with this thing,

727
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,849
you must know beforehand exactly what
you're gonna do and say at all times.

728
00:56:27,921 --> 00:56:30,412
Perfect naturalness
at all times.

729
00:56:32,259 --> 00:56:34,887
Now, darling, listen to me.

730
00:56:34,962 --> 00:56:36,054
Darling,

731
00:56:38,185 --> 00:56:41,460
I am prepared to
go to the police.

732
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:43,765
It's your father, Miss
Mary. He wants to talk to you.

733
00:56:43,837 --> 00:56:46,465
- Yes, thank you, Sara.
- Mary.

734
00:56:58,719 --> 00:56:59,879
Hello?

735
00:57:01,321 --> 00:57:03,050
Yes, I think so.

736
00:57:03,123 --> 00:57:05,216
Just a minute and I'll see.

737
00:57:05,786 --> 00:57:07,952
He wants me to come over.

738
00:57:07,982 --> 00:57:09,723
Did he ask me, too?

739
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,105
He said he wanted
to see me alone.

740
00:57:13,389 --> 00:57:17,553
There's nothing unusual about a father
wanting to see his daughter. Is there?

741
00:57:17,583 --> 00:57:19,102
- Is there?
- No.

742
00:57:21,987 --> 00:57:24,072
All right, Adam.
I'll be right over.

743
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:31,697
- Don't you think that's rather strange?
- Strange? No, not strange.

744
00:57:31,774 --> 00:57:33,469
- Charles.
- Tell you what I'll do.

745
00:57:33,499 --> 00:57:36,567
I'll go over to the church and work on
the clock while you're with your father.

746
00:57:36,597 --> 00:57:39,516
Then you come by and
pick me up later.

747
00:57:39,769 --> 00:57:41,334
I'm so afraid.

748
00:57:42,632 --> 00:57:45,226
It was so pointed, his
wanting to see me alone.

749
00:57:45,301 --> 00:57:46,598
His voice sounded so different.

750
00:57:46,669 --> 00:57:49,160
Now you know what you're
going to say, don't you?

751
00:58:08,357 --> 00:58:09,881
Come in, Mary.

752
00:58:13,546 --> 00:58:15,893
Is something wrong?

753
00:58:15,923 --> 00:58:18,934
Mr. Wilson is here on a
very serious matter.

754
00:58:19,001 --> 00:58:21,299
We must try to help him
every way possible.

755
00:58:22,656 --> 00:58:25,216
What do you
want to know, Mr. Wilson?

756
00:58:26,727 --> 00:58:30,192
You know about the body that was
discovered yesterday, Mrs. Rankin?

757
00:58:31,013 --> 00:58:32,089
Yes.

758
00:58:32,866 --> 00:58:35,198
Did you ever meet the deceased?

759
00:58:35,269 --> 00:58:37,260
No. No, no, I never met him.

760
00:58:37,337 --> 00:58:39,237
Have you seen the body?

761
00:58:40,053 --> 00:58:41,111
No.

762
00:58:41,788 --> 00:58:45,224
Well, then, how can you be
sure you've never met him?

763
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,221
Of course, I can't be certain.

764
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:53,062
Mr. Wilson, do you
suspect me of something?

765
00:58:53,132 --> 00:58:54,724
If so, what?

766
00:58:54,801 --> 00:58:56,769
Of shielding a murderer.

767
00:58:57,637 --> 00:59:00,800
Perhaps this photograph
will refresh your memory.

768
00:59:01,507 --> 00:59:03,532
Do you recognize this man?

769
00:59:04,043 --> 00:59:06,102
That is Konrad Meinike.

770
00:59:06,179 --> 00:59:10,582
Commander in charge of one of the
more efficient concentration camps.

771
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:12,982
You know him, don't you?

772
00:59:13,052 --> 00:59:15,486
You have met him here in Harper.

773
00:59:15,555 --> 00:59:18,490
No, no, I've never seen
that man, Mr. Wilson.

774
00:59:21,427 --> 00:59:24,590
Judge, would you mind
putting out the lights?

775
00:59:24,664 --> 00:59:28,603
I've been showing your father some films,
and I'd like you to see them, too.

776
00:59:28,633 --> 00:59:32,735
I'm on the Allied Commission for
the punishment of war criminals.

777
00:59:32,965 --> 00:59:35,991
It's my job to bring
escaped Nazis to justice.

778
00:59:37,002 --> 00:59:39,698
It's that job that
brought me to Harper.

779
00:59:43,475 --> 00:59:45,807
Well, surely you
don't think that...

780
00:59:45,878 --> 00:59:47,539
Mr. Wilson, I've never...

781
00:59:47,613 --> 00:59:49,843
I've never so much
as even seen a Nazi.

782
00:59:49,915 --> 00:59:52,281
Well, you might without
your realizing it.

783
00:59:52,351 --> 00:59:55,752
They look like other people
and act like other people,

784
00:59:55,821 --> 00:59:57,914
when it's to their benefit.

785
01:00:00,626 --> 01:00:03,026
A gas chamber, Mrs. Rankin.

786
01:00:04,129 --> 01:00:06,504
The candidates were
first given hot showers

787
01:00:06,534 --> 01:00:08,784
so that their pores would
be open and the...

788
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:11,565
...gas would act that
much more quickly.

789
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:15,965
And this is a lime pit

790
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:19,568
in which hundreds of men, women
and children were buried alive.

791
01:00:22,348 --> 01:00:24,782
Why do you want me to
look at these horrors?

792
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:26,681
All this you're seeing,

793
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,886
it's all the product
of one mind.

794
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:37,185
The mind of a man
named Franz Kindler.

795
01:00:38,297 --> 01:00:39,764
Franz Kindler.

796
01:00:39,832 --> 01:00:43,825
Yes, he was the most brilliant of the
younger minds from the Nazi party.

797
01:00:43,902 --> 01:00:46,946
It was Kindler who conceived
the theory of genocide,

798
01:00:47,058 --> 01:00:49,505
mass depopulation of
conquered countries.

799
01:00:49,575 --> 01:00:51,488
So that regardless
of who won the war,

800
01:00:51,518 --> 01:00:54,296
Germany would emerge the strongest
nation in Western Europe,

801
01:00:54,326 --> 01:00:56,038
biologically speaking.

802
01:00:56,115 --> 01:00:59,482
Unlike Goebbels, Himmler
and the rest of them,

803
01:00:59,551 --> 01:01:01,610
Kindler had a passion
for anonymity.

804
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:04,121
The newspapers carried
no picture of him.

805
01:01:04,151 --> 01:01:06,521
Oh, no, and just before
he disappeared, he...

806
01:01:06,551 --> 01:01:09,254
...destroyed every evidence that
might link him with his past

807
01:01:09,284 --> 01:01:10,941
down to the last fingerprint.

808
01:01:10,971 --> 01:01:14,224
There's no clue to the
identity of Franz Kindler,

809
01:01:14,299 --> 01:01:16,199
except one little thing.

810
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,639
He has a hobby that almost
amounts to a mania.

811
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,498
Clocks.

812
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:25,564
So have lots of people.

813
01:01:25,636 --> 01:01:27,103
You yourself.

814
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:30,401
Well, I'm not quite
finished, Mrs. Rankin.

815
01:01:31,909 --> 01:01:36,539
In prison, in Czechoslovakia, a war
criminal was awaiting execution.

816
01:01:36,613 --> 01:01:40,879
This was Konrad Meinike, onetime
executive officer for Franz Kindler.

817
01:01:41,518 --> 01:01:44,510
He was an obscenity on
the face of the earth.

818
01:01:44,588 --> 01:01:47,716
The stench of burning
flesh was in his clothes.

819
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:51,852
But we gave him his freedom on the
chance that he might lead me to Kindler.

820
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:54,923
He led me here, Mrs. Rankin.

821
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:57,396
And here, I lost him.

822
01:01:58,035 --> 01:01:59,627
Until yesterday.

823
01:02:00,137 --> 01:02:01,832
Your dog, Red, found him for me.

824
01:02:01,905 --> 01:02:04,897
But unfortunately, Meinike
was dead and buried.

825
01:02:05,642 --> 01:02:07,940
Now, in all the world,

826
01:02:09,579 --> 01:02:13,379
there is only one person who
can identify Franz Kindler.

827
01:02:14,484 --> 01:02:17,093
That person is the
one who knows,

828
01:02:17,721 --> 01:02:21,282
knows definitely, who Meinike
came to Harper to see.

829
01:02:28,065 --> 01:02:29,589
No, he's not a Nazi!

830
01:02:29,666 --> 01:02:31,634
My Charles is not a Nazi!

831
01:02:34,604 --> 01:02:36,663
You were in Rankin's house during
the afternoon of the day...

832
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:38,264
- Where?
- Rankin's house.

833
01:02:38,342 --> 01:02:40,276
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Did anyone come while you were there?

834
01:02:40,344 --> 01:02:41,971
- Not that I remember.
- Now try hard to remember.

835
01:02:42,045 --> 01:02:43,410
It's not so long ago.
Only two weeks.

836
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,107
- You were hanging curtains.
- No one came.

837
01:02:45,182 --> 01:02:48,049
- Were you alone all the time?
- No.

838
01:02:48,118 --> 01:02:50,712
- Who else was there?
- Charles.

839
01:02:51,555 --> 01:02:53,955
He came right after
his last class.

840
01:02:54,024 --> 01:02:55,952
And we were together
for more than an hour.

841
01:02:55,982 --> 01:02:58,365
You have nothing to link my
husband with this man Kindler

842
01:02:58,395 --> 01:03:00,029
except a wild suspicion.

843
01:03:00,097 --> 01:03:02,258
It's a ridiculous suspicion.

844
01:03:02,332 --> 01:03:05,358
If you're trying to use me
to implicate him, you can't.

845
01:03:05,435 --> 01:03:09,565
You can't involve me in a lie.
That's... That's all it is, is a lie.

846
01:03:09,639 --> 01:03:11,800
It's a lie, you know.
It's a lie.

847
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:13,866
- It's a lie.
- Mary! Mary!

848
01:03:14,978 --> 01:03:16,775
Wait a minute. Mary!

849
01:03:25,022 --> 01:03:26,114
Mary!

850
01:03:27,024 --> 01:03:28,855
Wait a minute, sister!

851
01:03:35,665 --> 01:03:37,223
Now that's better.

852
01:03:58,031 --> 01:04:01,159
You know that your
welfare, and Noah's,

853
01:04:01,189 --> 01:04:03,725
means more to me than
anything, don't you?

854
01:04:03,803 --> 01:04:05,532
Yes. Yes.

855
01:04:06,339 --> 01:04:09,831
Then you've got to face this thing
with complete honesty, sister.

856
01:04:10,948 --> 01:04:15,640
Your entire happiness may well depend
on your telling me the absolute truth.

857
01:04:17,617 --> 01:04:19,107
If Mr. Wilson is right,

858
01:04:19,185 --> 01:04:22,348
and you have innocently
married a criminal,

859
01:04:22,422 --> 01:04:24,219
well, then, there
is no marriage.

860
01:04:24,249 --> 01:04:27,726
There's no call upon
your loyalty as a wife.

861
01:04:27,794 --> 01:04:29,125
He's good!

862
01:04:30,496 --> 01:04:33,192
He's good. He
wouldn't hurt anybody

863
01:04:33,266 --> 01:04:37,100
except to protect somebody
he loved. He's...

864
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:40,037
- He's good.
- Well, then, the truth can't hurt him.

865
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:47,477
Charles was not with you
that afternoon, sister.

866
01:04:47,547 --> 01:04:49,879
I remember your saying
so when you came home.

867
01:04:49,949 --> 01:04:51,473
- You're against him, too, Adam!
- No.

868
01:04:51,551 --> 01:04:52,779
Yes you are!

869
01:04:52,852 --> 01:04:55,480
You've never liked him and that's
why you don't believe me now!

870
01:04:55,555 --> 01:04:57,785
Leave us alone, Adam!

871
01:04:57,857 --> 01:05:00,758
He's not a Nazi! He's not
one of those people!

872
01:05:00,827 --> 01:05:02,954
He's not! Leave us alone!

873
01:05:08,835 --> 01:05:12,828
She has the facts now, but
she won't accept them.

874
01:05:14,774 --> 01:05:17,675
They're too horrible for
her to acknowledge.

875
01:05:19,045 --> 01:05:21,513
Not so much that Rankin
could be Kindler,

876
01:05:21,581 --> 01:05:25,039
but that she could ever have given
her love to such a creature.

877
01:05:26,986 --> 01:05:30,615
But we have one ally,
her subconscious.

878
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:34,148
It knows what the truth is and
it's struggling to be heard.

879
01:05:34,961 --> 01:05:39,295
The will to truth within your daughter
is much too strong to be denied.

880
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:43,002
Look here, Wilson, if
he's not Charles Rankin,

881
01:05:43,032 --> 01:05:45,544
we should be able to expose him
without too much difficulty.

882
01:05:45,612 --> 01:05:47,910
I'm not interested in proving
that he isn't Charles Rankin.

883
01:05:47,981 --> 01:05:50,074
I'm only interested in proving
that he's Franz Kindler.

884
01:05:50,149 --> 01:05:52,117
How do you propose to do that?

885
01:05:56,689 --> 01:05:58,220
Through your daughter.

886
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,736
Unless I'm mistaken, she's
headed for a breakdown.

887
01:06:00,886 --> 01:06:03,637
That's the usual result of a
person being inwardly divided.

888
01:06:03,697 --> 01:06:05,858
Rankin will recognize this and
that's what I'm banking on.

889
01:06:05,932 --> 01:06:07,832
- What do you mean?
- Well, he can't afford to trust

890
01:06:07,901 --> 01:06:10,927
a person approaching hysteria.
He won't. He'll have to act.

891
01:06:11,004 --> 01:06:12,904
He may try to escape
before she collapses,

892
01:06:12,973 --> 01:06:16,170
which would only be an
admission of guilt or...

893
01:06:17,243 --> 01:06:18,540
Go on.

894
01:06:18,611 --> 01:06:20,238
He may kill her.

895
01:06:22,182 --> 01:06:24,013
You're shocked at my
cold-bloodedness.

896
01:06:24,084 --> 01:06:26,609
Well, that's quite natural,
you're her father.

897
01:06:26,686 --> 01:06:29,177
And it's because you are her
father, Judge Longstreet,

898
01:06:29,207 --> 01:06:31,086
that I am talking
to you like this.

899
01:06:32,258 --> 01:06:35,193
Naturally, we'll try to
prevent murder being done.

900
01:06:37,964 --> 01:06:40,262
However, the proof
that murder is his aim

901
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:42,927
would be the strongest evidence
that your daughter could have.

902
01:06:57,417 --> 01:06:58,645
Charles.

903
01:07:07,727 --> 01:07:10,787
Listen, it's striking. A
hundred years after...

904
01:07:10,864 --> 01:07:12,695
It was a trap, Charles,
just like you said.

905
01:07:12,766 --> 01:07:14,131
Mr. Wilson was there.

906
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:18,296
He tried to tell me that you were a
Nazi, and I was supposed to believe it.

907
01:07:18,371 --> 01:07:20,339
Imagine you being
an escaped Nazi.

908
01:07:20,407 --> 01:07:22,375
Oh, he thinks he's very
clever, that Wilson.

909
01:07:22,442 --> 01:07:26,037
His idea was to horrify me into
telling him about the little man.

910
01:07:26,112 --> 01:07:29,377
- Who did he say he thought I was?
- A Nazi.

911
01:07:30,116 --> 01:07:31,606
Franz Kindler.

912
01:07:32,752 --> 01:07:34,276
He made it all up
just to trick me.

913
01:07:34,354 --> 01:07:36,481
But I didn't tell him anything and
I didn't tell father anything.

914
01:07:36,556 --> 01:07:39,047
I out-faced both
of them, Charles.

915
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:42,822
It'll be simple enough to
prove you're not that Nazi.

916
01:07:42,896 --> 01:07:45,660
We'll just find someone who was in your
class at college and he'll identify you,

917
01:07:45,732 --> 01:07:47,199
and that's all
there'll be to it.

918
01:07:47,267 --> 01:07:49,929
If what you say is true,
he can't touch me.

919
01:07:49,959 --> 01:07:53,131
I'm quite safe if
you say nothing.

920
01:07:53,673 --> 01:07:55,834
Oh, I won't, Charles.
I promise I won't.

921
01:07:55,909 --> 01:07:58,571
They can torture me and I
won't tell them anything!

922
01:08:01,614 --> 01:08:04,276
Look, the chimes have
awakened Harper.

923
01:08:12,025 --> 01:08:14,289
We must go down and greet them.

924
01:08:15,061 --> 01:08:16,961
- You must act natural.
- Yes.

925
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:18,691
- Smile at them, you understand?
- Yes.

926
01:08:18,765 --> 01:08:21,393
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.

927
01:08:22,168 --> 01:08:23,999
We'll face them, darling.

928
01:08:26,272 --> 01:08:28,777
And when she struck, that
angel started marching.

929
01:08:28,807 --> 01:08:30,771
It was a sight to behold.

930
01:08:31,277 --> 01:08:33,507
Professor, you sure knocked
it off, my hat's off to you.

931
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:34,945
Congratulations, Mr. Rankin.

932
01:08:35,014 --> 01:08:37,346
Won't the rector be delighted?

933
01:08:37,417 --> 01:08:39,783
What I want to know is, if
she's gonna chime all night long,

934
01:08:39,813 --> 01:08:41,946
how's a body gonna
get any sleep?

935
01:08:41,976 --> 01:08:44,649
We'll face them,
darling, all of them.

936
01:08:45,273 --> 01:08:48,888
Them chickens sure is gonna be on
and off the roost every 15 minutes.

937
01:09:03,527 --> 01:09:04,495
Sara.

938
01:09:05,351 --> 01:09:07,546
Sara, I've told you I want
these curtains drawn.

939
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:10,180
I don't like the sunlight
streaming in, it's bad for them.

940
01:09:10,256 --> 01:09:11,951
Mary, that's
rubbish and you know it.

941
01:09:12,024 --> 01:09:13,616
Up at the other house, we
never closed the curtains.

942
01:09:13,646 --> 01:09:14,750
That has nothing to do with it.

943
01:09:14,827 --> 01:09:17,116
This is my house and
I want them drawn.

944
01:09:17,146 --> 01:09:19,296
Well, suit yourself then.

945
01:09:19,965 --> 01:09:22,661
It's going to look mighty
gloomy for the party.

946
01:09:24,017 --> 01:09:25,623
Is it that time already?

947
01:09:31,677 --> 01:09:33,907
Were you able to see when they
opened the grave, Mr. Randall?

948
01:09:33,979 --> 01:09:35,173
- Oh, yes.
- Was it too horrible?

949
01:09:35,247 --> 01:09:37,078
Well, not the most
pleasant sight.

950
01:09:37,149 --> 01:09:39,208
There's Mary. Hello, Mary.

951
01:09:41,086 --> 01:09:43,987
Filling out prescriptions. That's
the part of this business I hate.

952
01:09:44,056 --> 01:09:46,320
- Sleeping pills, that's another.
- That's for Mrs. Rankin.

953
01:09:46,392 --> 01:09:47,689
- $1.65.
- Okay.

954
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,784
- Want them wrapped?
- No thanks.

955
01:09:48,861 --> 01:09:50,658
- Sleeping pills! Don't approve of them!
- No?

956
01:09:50,729 --> 01:09:53,197
Man does a day's work, man
gets a night's sleep.

957
01:09:53,265 --> 01:09:56,063
Leastways, he could until that clock
started bonging every few minutes...

958
01:09:56,135 --> 01:09:59,263
I believe Mrs. Rankin ordered
some ice cream, didn't she?

959
01:09:59,338 --> 01:10:01,397
- Ice cream? Already gone.
- Yes.

960
01:10:01,473 --> 01:10:04,533
Fellow said he was going past
your house, so I give it to him.

961
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:05,975
Mr. Wilson.

962
01:10:11,984 --> 01:10:13,008
Mrs. Rankin.

963
01:10:13,085 --> 01:10:16,748
I wouldn't dream of setting foot
outside the house unless Fred were along.

964
01:10:16,822 --> 01:10:20,019
Who knows, he might be anywhere.
The murderer, I mean.

965
01:10:20,092 --> 01:10:22,083
Waiting for a new victim.

966
01:10:23,095 --> 01:10:26,997
I hope you haven't forgotten you were
kind enough to invite me, Mrs. Rankin.

967
01:10:27,066 --> 01:10:28,978
No, of course not, Mr. Wilson.

968
01:10:29,008 --> 01:10:31,864
- Mr. Potter asked me to deliver this.
- Oh, the ice cream, good.

969
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:35,031
- Sara's waiting for it.
- I hope it hasn't melted.

970
01:10:35,708 --> 01:10:38,302
- Well, I won't detain you any longer.
- Ah, yes...

971
01:10:38,377 --> 01:10:40,470
- I have a drink for you.
- Just the medicine I need.

972
01:10:40,546 --> 01:10:42,912
- You know Dr. Hippard?
- Oh, yes, of course.

973
01:10:42,942 --> 01:10:44,574
How are you, Doctor?

974
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:46,208
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, sure.

975
01:10:46,285 --> 01:10:48,014
Grandma Lawrence, can I
get you something else?

976
01:10:48,044 --> 01:10:50,055
Nothing more, thank you, dear.

977
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:54,291
- Where's Dr. Rankin?
- Oh, he'll be here in just a few minutes.

978
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:55,987
I want to have a word with
him about that clock.

979
01:10:56,061 --> 01:10:57,119
Yes.

980
01:10:57,318 --> 01:10:59,128
Well, thank you, brother.

981
01:11:00,299 --> 01:11:01,891
Yes, on my last trip.

982
01:11:01,967 --> 01:11:03,730
- May I get you something?
- No, thank you.

983
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,168
And Jack the Ripper. And what
was that Frenchman's name?

984
01:11:06,238 --> 01:11:07,540
- Hello, dear.
- Hello.

985
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:08,573
Landru.

986
01:11:09,033 --> 01:11:11,904
Yes, there may well be
ten or a dozen graves

987
01:11:11,977 --> 01:11:13,911
- out there in those woods.
Ten or a dozen!

988
01:11:13,941 --> 01:11:16,447
Autopsy showed the murder
was committed just three weeks ago.

989
01:11:16,477 --> 01:11:18,813
- May I get you some more tea?
- Thank you, no.

990
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,280
Jeff, may I get you
another drink?

991
01:11:22,354 --> 01:11:24,788
I wish I could remember
what Emerson says about crime.

992
01:11:24,818 --> 01:11:26,119
Oh, there's Rankin.

993
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:29,126
- He may know.
- Sorry to be late. Hello, everybody.

994
01:11:29,156 --> 01:11:30,388
Darling.

995
01:11:30,462 --> 01:11:32,692
- Oh, hello, there, Rankin.
- How are you, Mr. Wilson?

996
01:11:32,722 --> 01:11:34,204
- You know the quotation?
- Mr. Hippard.

997
01:11:34,234 --> 01:11:35,594
- Emerson.
- Quotation?

998
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:38,135
"Commit a crime and the
earth is made of glass. "

999
01:11:38,203 --> 01:11:39,602
No, I don't.

1000
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:44,601
"Commit a crime and the
earth is made of glass.

1001
01:11:44,631 --> 01:11:46,473
"Commit a crime...

1002
01:11:47,525 --> 01:11:52,220
"Commit a crime, and it seems as if
a coat of snow fell on the ground,

1003
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:56,691
"such as reveals in the woods the
track of every partridge and fox

1004
01:11:56,721 --> 01:11:58,691
"and squirrel and mole.

1005
01:11:59,057 --> 01:12:01,724
"You cannot recall
the spoken word,

1006
01:12:01,996 --> 01:12:03,968
"you cannot wipe out
the foot-track,

1007
01:12:03,998 --> 01:12:08,520
"you cannot draw up the ladder,
so as to leave no inlet or clue. "

1008
01:12:09,068 --> 01:12:10,454
- You're Mr. Wilson, aren't you?
- Yes.

1009
01:12:10,484 --> 01:12:14,238
Do you know you're our number one
suspect in our murder case? - Oh?

1010
01:12:14,268 --> 01:12:16,087
So far you're the only suspect.

1011
01:12:16,117 --> 01:12:17,392
Potter put the finger on you.

1012
01:12:17,422 --> 01:12:20,478
He thinks you committed the crime to get
possession of some priceless antiques.

1013
01:12:20,546 --> 01:12:21,570
You want a drink, Mr. Wilson?

1014
01:12:21,647 --> 01:12:23,672
Mr. Rankin, I wish
you'd left that clock alone.

1015
01:12:23,749 --> 01:12:27,150
Harper was a nice quiet place
until it started banging.

1016
01:12:28,715 --> 01:12:32,809
- Mary, what's Wilson doing here?
- I don't know.

1017
01:12:32,931 --> 01:12:34,264
You invited him, didn't you?

1018
01:12:34,294 --> 01:12:36,381
- What's he after?
- I don't know.

1019
01:12:38,129 --> 01:12:40,927
- Are you all right?
- Yes, quite all right.

1020
01:12:43,768 --> 01:12:45,326
- Now, remember Friday, Mary.
- Yes, all right.

1021
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:47,667
- Good night.
- Good night.

1022
01:12:56,781 --> 01:12:58,681
- May I help you, dear?
- No!

1023
01:13:00,451 --> 01:13:02,316
No, no, no!

1024
01:13:04,722 --> 01:13:06,986
- Mary, Mary, Mary.
- No.

1025
01:13:07,792 --> 01:13:10,352
It's all right, dear.
It's all right.

1026
01:13:17,835 --> 01:13:21,464
It broke, and the beads
fell all over the floor.

1027
01:13:23,741 --> 01:13:26,039
He took her upstairs.

1028
01:13:27,478 --> 01:13:29,969
When I left, I could
still hear her crying.

1029
01:13:30,048 --> 01:13:32,516
Well, the floodgates
have opened.

1030
01:13:32,583 --> 01:13:34,881
Her subconscious has almost won.

1031
01:13:36,679 --> 01:13:40,031
From now on, we must know every
move that Mrs. Rankin makes.

1032
01:13:40,473 --> 01:13:44,221
She's never to leave the house
unless I know where she's going.

1033
01:13:44,295 --> 01:13:46,695
If for any reason I can't be
found, she's to be detained,

1034
01:13:46,764 --> 01:13:48,595
no matter on what pretext.

1035
01:13:48,625 --> 01:13:49,894
You understand, Sara?

1036
01:13:49,968 --> 01:13:52,095
Don't worry, she
won't get by me.

1037
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:55,401
When she snapped those beads, she
signed her own death warrant.

1038
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:58,067
We're carrying her
life in our hands.

1039
01:13:59,277 --> 01:14:02,007
Every time she walks on
a slippery sidewalk,

1040
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:04,978
is near something that can fall,

1041
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:06,776
drives an automobile,

1042
01:14:06,806 --> 01:14:10,150
anything that could result
in an accidental death,

1043
01:14:10,221 --> 01:14:12,052
her life is in danger.

1044
01:14:12,123 --> 01:14:14,557
Yes, Judge. She won't get by me.

1045
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:07,299
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Good afternoon, sir.

1046
01:15:07,329 --> 01:15:11,917
Today we will attempt to finish with
the career of Friedrich der Grosse,

1047
01:15:11,947 --> 01:15:14,038
Konig von Preussen,

1048
01:15:14,068 --> 01:15:17,076
Kufurst von Brandenberg,
Prince von Polen.

1049
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:19,958
Frederick the Great to you.

1050
01:15:23,618 --> 01:15:24,424
86...

1051
01:15:24,454 --> 01:15:26,917
- 862, please.
That'll be 85 cents.

1052
01:15:39,367 --> 01:15:41,335
- Hello?
- Mary.

1053
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:44,935
Mary, this is Charles.

1054
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:48,656
Can you hear me, dear?

1055
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:52,122
I can't speak very loudly where I am,
but I want you to understand this.

1056
01:15:52,152 --> 01:15:54,591
Something very
important has come up.

1057
01:15:54,621 --> 01:15:57,323
You must come to the
church immediately.

1058
01:15:57,353 --> 01:15:58,853
The church tower.

1059
01:15:58,883 --> 01:16:01,417
- Understand?
- Yes, I understand.

1060
01:16:01,447 --> 01:16:04,111
I don't want anybody to know
that you're going there.

1061
01:16:04,496 --> 01:16:06,149
Mary, don't tell
anybody you're going.

1062
01:16:06,179 --> 01:16:08,346
Go to the church tower and
leave your car in the rear

1063
01:16:08,376 --> 01:16:10,111
and come in through
the back door.

1064
01:16:11,407 --> 01:16:12,440
Okay?

1065
01:16:13,013 --> 01:16:14,102
Goodbye now.

1066
01:16:22,366 --> 01:16:23,538
Peabody!

1067
01:16:23,568 --> 01:16:26,809
They're coming.
They're coming, Mr. Potter.

1068
01:16:26,839 --> 01:16:30,058
Rack that wood down there with the
rest of them, then get back to work.

1069
01:16:30,088 --> 01:16:31,339
Yes, sir.

1070
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:41,413
Watch that, Mr. Peabody.

1071
01:16:42,709 --> 01:16:44,165
Your move, Professor.

1072
01:16:46,971 --> 01:16:48,370
Going someplace?

1073
01:16:49,769 --> 01:16:50,830
Where to?

1074
01:16:52,118 --> 01:16:53,959
I asked you where you
was going, Miss Mary.

1075
01:16:53,989 --> 01:16:55,865
- I heard.
- Well.

1076
01:16:56,719 --> 01:17:00,142
Sara, you seem to forget I'm no
longer a child, I'm a married woman.

1077
01:17:00,172 --> 01:17:02,649
Well, you ain't been
married very long.

1078
01:17:05,158 --> 01:17:06,818
Wait, Mrs. Rankin.

1079
01:17:08,076 --> 01:17:09,623
What is it? I'm in a hurry.

1080
01:17:09,653 --> 01:17:12,214
Well, you don't need to
go biting my head off!

1081
01:17:16,755 --> 01:17:19,087
- What is it, Sara?
- Well, I...

1082
01:17:20,092 --> 01:17:21,719
I don't...

1083
01:17:21,793 --> 01:17:23,886
If you've got something to
say, say it! What is it, Sara?

1084
01:17:23,962 --> 01:17:26,487
I don't know what's got into
you lately. Indeed I don't.

1085
01:17:26,565 --> 01:17:29,033
You never was mean to me like
this back at the old house.

1086
01:17:29,101 --> 01:17:31,626
- Sara, I...
- Maybe I've outworn my usefulness.

1087
01:17:31,703 --> 01:17:33,694
I'm not as young
as I used to be.

1088
01:17:33,772 --> 01:17:35,434
Maybe you don't want
me around anymore!

1089
01:17:35,464 --> 01:17:37,237
For heaven's sake, stop
talking such nonsense!

1090
01:17:37,267 --> 01:17:39,108
Well, it's true and you know it!

1091
01:17:39,311 --> 01:17:42,508
I'm gonna pack my things and
leave here! Indeed I am!

1092
01:17:44,883 --> 01:17:46,908
Sara, I'm sorry if I've
hurt your feelings.

1093
01:17:46,985 --> 01:17:49,419
I didn't mean to,
really I didn't.

1094
01:17:50,322 --> 01:17:54,418
Sara, now I couldn't get along without
you and you know that, don't you?

1095
01:17:55,427 --> 01:17:57,308
- Well, don't you?
- Honest, Miss Mary?

1096
01:17:57,338 --> 01:17:59,798
- Yes, honestly, honestly, Sara.
- Oh, Miss Mary.

1097
01:17:59,828 --> 01:18:04,663
- Oh, Miss Mary.
- Sara, Sara, please, wait, just a minute.

1098
01:18:05,704 --> 01:18:08,605
Sara, you will never
leave me, will you?

1099
01:18:08,674 --> 01:18:10,471
You know how I feel
about you, don't you?

1100
01:18:10,542 --> 01:18:12,510
- Yes, I do, Sara.
- Like you was my own daughter,

1101
01:18:12,578 --> 01:18:14,205
my own little girl.
How could I...

1102
01:18:14,279 --> 01:18:17,680
Sara, I've got to go now, really I
do. I promised to be somewhere.

1103
01:18:17,749 --> 01:18:20,115
Well... Well, where
to, Miss Mary?

1104
01:18:25,958 --> 01:18:27,721
Stop fussing, Sara.

1105
01:18:28,794 --> 01:18:30,193
It's a secret.

1106
01:18:31,997 --> 01:18:33,294
Oh, Miss Mary!

1107
01:18:35,923 --> 01:18:38,331
What's the matter? Sara,
what's the matter?

1108
01:18:38,403 --> 01:18:41,600
My heart! I can't breathe!
The pain!

1109
01:18:42,574 --> 01:18:46,101
No, Miss Mary, please don't
leave me! No, don't leave me!

1110
01:18:46,178 --> 01:18:48,669
Now lie there, keep quiet.
Keep quiet now, Sara!

1111
01:18:48,747 --> 01:18:51,079
- Maybe I'm dying!
- You're not dying.

1112
01:18:52,284 --> 01:18:55,253
- Please stay with me!
- I won't leave you.

1113
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,685
130, please.

1114
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:02,686
Yes, Mary?

1115
01:19:02,761 --> 01:19:05,628
Look, I was supposed to meet Charles
at the clock tower right away

1116
01:19:05,658 --> 01:19:07,528
and I can't get there.

1117
01:19:07,599 --> 01:19:10,448
Will you go and tell him
to please wait for me?

1118
01:19:11,003 --> 01:19:14,769
And, Noah, no one's to know
where or why you're going.

1119
01:19:14,799 --> 01:19:16,365
It's important.

1120
01:19:16,775 --> 01:19:18,072
All right.

1121
01:19:25,651 --> 01:19:27,050
238, please.

1122
01:19:28,671 --> 01:19:30,186
Hello, may I speak
to Mr. Wilson?

1123
01:19:33,091 --> 01:19:35,375
Looks like it's
coming up for snow.

1124
01:19:35,826 --> 01:19:37,622
Yes, that's right.

1125
01:20:06,558 --> 01:20:09,398
Mrs. Rand, Mrs. Lundstrom.
Isn't it after hours?

1126
01:20:09,428 --> 01:20:11,862
You ladies are working
too hard at the library.

1127
01:20:11,930 --> 01:20:15,331
Oh, no, Mr. Rankin,
we closed as usual at 3:30.

1128
01:20:15,361 --> 01:20:19,632
You're perfectly right. I
dismissed class 10 minutes early.

1129
01:20:19,705 --> 01:20:23,471
Yes, it's 3:44.

1130
01:20:24,984 --> 01:20:28,242
I was playing checkers with
Mr. Potter and I didn't realize.

1131
01:20:28,272 --> 01:20:33,408
You know what you are, Mr. Rankin?
You're the absentminded professor!

1132
01:21:11,356 --> 01:21:12,956
You sure are lucky today.

1133
01:21:12,986 --> 01:21:14,423
- I am, indeed.
- You sure are.

1134
01:21:14,493 --> 01:21:16,723
Good afternoon, Mr. Potter.
- Afternoon, Mr. Hill.

1135
01:21:16,795 --> 01:21:18,126
Sorry, Mr. Potter,
I can't find them.

1136
01:21:18,196 --> 01:21:19,254
- What?
- The earmuffs.

1137
01:21:19,331 --> 01:21:20,855
Right over there by the mittens.

1138
01:21:20,932 --> 01:21:22,399
Come on, Mr. Potter,
help us look.

1139
01:21:22,467 --> 01:21:25,163
Well, I'll be right back
in a minute, Professor.

1140
01:21:25,237 --> 01:21:27,467
Right over there by that
box where I told you they was.

1141
01:21:27,539 --> 01:21:30,007
- Those?
- They're the latest thing out.

1142
01:21:31,443 --> 01:21:33,296
- How much do you want for them?
- 85 cents.

1143
01:21:33,326 --> 01:21:36,498
- That's an awful lot.
- Well, they come high this year.

1144
01:21:38,554 --> 01:21:40,817
- You want this thing?
- Aw, keep it.

1145
01:21:40,847 --> 01:21:43,347
You know, Mr. Potter, you're
a bad influence. I, ah...

1146
01:21:43,377 --> 01:21:45,921
I intended only to spend
a couple of minutes.

1147
01:21:45,991 --> 01:21:49,064
You've made me spend the whole
afternoon. Look what time it is. Yeah.

1148
01:21:49,094 --> 01:21:52,397
- I'd like to get even.
- It's your move.

1149
01:21:54,344 --> 01:21:55,971
Look there, Professor.

1150
01:21:56,045 --> 01:21:58,980
- Like I told you, it's coming up for snow.
- Yes.

1151
01:22:18,091 --> 01:22:19,603
Look here, Professor.

1152
01:22:26,943 --> 01:22:28,402
Double or nothing?

1153
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:45,028
- Good afternoon, Mr. Potter.
- Afternoon, Professor.

1154
01:23:06,049 --> 01:23:07,277
Charles.

1155
01:23:19,929 --> 01:23:21,453
- You didn't go to the church?
- No.

1156
01:23:21,531 --> 01:23:22,998
- No, Sara...
- Sara, what about Sara?

1157
01:23:23,066 --> 01:23:25,398
Well, just as I was leaving,
Sara had some kind of an attack.

1158
01:23:25,468 --> 01:23:26,992
- An attack?
- She's resting now, yes.

1159
01:23:27,070 --> 01:23:30,972
And Jeff said it wasn't very serious,
but that I should stay with her.

1160
01:23:43,887 --> 01:23:47,721
What's the matter, Charles?
- Nothing's the matter.

1161
01:23:48,324 --> 01:23:50,918
Then why did you want
me to go to the church?

1162
01:23:50,994 --> 01:23:53,019
You said it was important.

1163
01:23:53,463 --> 01:23:55,897
It isn't important.
Nothing actually.

1164
01:23:55,927 --> 01:23:59,867
My sense of proportion is
failing me these days.

1165
01:24:01,362 --> 01:24:03,564
Please, Charles, what is it?

1166
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:09,482
I'm sorry.

1167
01:24:11,712 --> 01:24:13,771
I've just begun to
feel the strain.

1168
01:24:13,848 --> 01:24:16,009
You see, I have my
weak moments, too.

1169
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:20,777
I'll tell you in
my own good time.

1170
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:25,119
- Have they found out anything more?
- No, nothing that I can find out.

1171
01:24:25,149 --> 01:24:27,183
- Unless you?
- No, I haven't seen anybody all day.

1172
01:24:27,213 --> 01:24:28,250
I've been in my room.

1173
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:30,957
There's a rumor going around that
there's an arrest to be made.

1174
01:24:31,031 --> 01:24:32,311
My head aches.

1175
01:24:32,433 --> 01:24:36,092
The incident with the beads yesterday
made me doubt your strength.

1176
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:38,832
I thought maybe you'd gone to your
father and told him something.

1177
01:24:38,906 --> 01:24:40,703
If you had...

1178
01:24:43,278 --> 01:24:45,193
You didn't have to be afraid.

1179
01:24:45,972 --> 01:24:46,996
No?

1180
01:24:49,066 --> 01:24:51,272
What did you tell Noah?

1181
01:24:51,451 --> 01:24:52,906
Why, what about?

1182
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:56,153
- Didn't you see him?
- No, why should I see Noah?

1183
01:24:56,223 --> 01:24:57,952
Well, did you come here
directly from the church?

1184
01:24:58,025 --> 01:24:59,322
Am I being cross-examined?

1185
01:24:59,393 --> 01:25:01,156
No, but when I found out
I couldn't leave Sara,

1186
01:25:01,186 --> 01:25:03,492
I called Noah and told him to go
there and tell you I was detained.

1187
01:25:03,522 --> 01:25:05,862
- I told you not to call anybody!
- But surely, Noah.

1188
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:06,957
Call him and tell him not to go!

1189
01:25:06,987 --> 01:25:08,331
Well, I can't, I
talked to him over...

1190
01:25:08,361 --> 01:25:10,370
- Call him, I say!
He's gone!

1191
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,201
If he dies, his blood
will be on your hands.

1192
01:25:12,231 --> 01:25:14,965
- What are you saying?
- It's your meddling that's done this!

1193
01:25:14,995 --> 01:25:17,566
I'd have been all right
if it wasn't for you.

1194
01:25:17,596 --> 01:25:18,861
But that you...

1195
01:25:18,891 --> 01:25:21,843
You had to be here on that day!

1196
01:25:21,916 --> 01:25:25,113
Hanging your stupid curtains.
Calling Noah.

1197
01:25:25,143 --> 01:25:26,256
Did you kill Noah?

1198
01:25:26,286 --> 01:25:29,392
Yes, if he goes to the church
and climbs up that ladder!

1199
01:25:34,662 --> 01:25:37,688
- It was I you intended to kill, wasn't it?
- No.

1200
01:25:37,718 --> 01:25:39,357
Why wasn't it I?

1201
01:25:40,534 --> 01:25:42,058
Franz Kindler!

1202
01:25:44,207 --> 01:25:45,435
Kill me.

1203
01:25:46,043 --> 01:25:47,601
Kill me, I want you to.

1204
01:25:47,678 --> 01:25:49,669
I couldn't face life knowing
what I've been to you

1205
01:25:49,746 --> 01:25:51,611
and what I've done to Noah.

1206
01:25:52,516 --> 01:25:55,883
But when you kill me, don't
put your hands on me!

1207
01:25:56,253 --> 01:25:57,481
Here!

1208
01:25:58,188 --> 01:25:59,485
Use this!

1209
01:26:08,485 --> 01:26:09,518
Mary!

1210
01:26:13,437 --> 01:26:14,529
Noah!

1211
01:26:16,873 --> 01:26:18,067
Operator.

1212
01:26:18,324 --> 01:26:20,991
Operator, get me
the state police.

1213
01:26:27,416 --> 01:26:29,509
Yes, the roadblocks are up.

1214
01:26:30,853 --> 01:26:34,619
We're watching the railroad station
and he isn't hiding in the woods.

1215
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:24,472
Judge Longstreet!
Judge Longstreet!

1216
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:34,482
You get Wilson, Noah!
I'll go for the police!

1217
01:27:49,465 --> 01:27:50,422
Mr. Wilson!

1218
01:27:50,452 --> 01:27:52,826
Well, if he is where I think
he is, it's going to be easy.

1219
01:27:52,856 --> 01:27:54,379
We'll do everything possible
to bring him back alive.

1220
01:27:54,409 --> 01:27:55,772
She's gone, Mr. Wilson!

1221
01:27:57,470 --> 01:28:00,030
- She's not in the house!
- The clock tower?

1222
01:28:01,507 --> 01:28:03,065
I don't know.

1223
01:28:03,142 --> 01:28:06,805
Well, if that's where he's hiding,
and she gets there before us...

1224
01:28:08,414 --> 01:28:10,075
What will we do?

1225
01:28:10,149 --> 01:28:11,741
Call Captain Samuels
and the deputies.

1226
01:28:11,771 --> 01:28:14,218
- Get all the help you can.
- Where?

1227
01:28:18,825 --> 01:28:20,163
The church, the church.

1228
01:28:20,193 --> 01:28:22,158
- What about you?
- I'll get there.

1229
01:28:22,188 --> 01:28:24,770
Now hurry up now, will you?
Your sister may be still alive.

1230
01:28:55,328 --> 01:28:56,727
Don't move.

1231
01:28:57,263 --> 01:28:58,730
I have a gun.

1232
01:28:59,666 --> 01:29:01,224
You don't need it.

1233
01:29:01,834 --> 01:29:03,165
I'm alone.

1234
01:29:03,569 --> 01:29:06,197
- What are you doing here?
- Lift me up.

1235
01:29:14,447 --> 01:29:16,039
You're telling the truth?

1236
01:29:16,683 --> 01:29:18,344
Why should I lie?

1237
01:29:21,387 --> 01:29:24,515
- You were followed here?
- I came by our way.

1238
01:29:24,590 --> 01:29:26,717
Through the cemetery.
No one saw me.

1239
01:29:42,008 --> 01:29:45,500
I needed the excuse. I was
afraid you wouldn't let me up.

1240
01:29:48,848 --> 01:29:51,180
- What do you want?
- I came to kill you.

1241
01:29:57,490 --> 01:30:00,323
No, no, Mary, it's you
that's going to die.

1242
01:30:01,094 --> 01:30:03,927
You were meant to fall
through that ladder.

1243
01:30:05,698 --> 01:30:07,495
You're going to fall.

1244
01:30:10,069 --> 01:30:12,367
I don't mind if I
take you with me.

1245
01:30:13,940 --> 01:30:15,771
You are a fool.

1246
01:30:18,611 --> 01:30:21,045
They've searched the woods.
I watched them.

1247
01:30:21,114 --> 01:30:23,844
Here, like God, looking
at little ants.

1248
01:30:23,916 --> 01:30:25,521
I'll hide in the woods. They
won't search there again.

1249
01:30:25,551 --> 01:30:26,928
In a day or two, they'll
be sure I got out of town.

1250
01:30:26,958 --> 01:30:28,544
When they find me, they'll
know you're still here.

1251
01:30:28,621 --> 01:30:31,181
But, darling, you're on
the verge of a breakdown.

1252
01:30:31,257 --> 01:30:32,724
Now you've cracked.

1253
01:30:33,359 --> 01:30:35,293
Why else would you
leave your bed,

1254
01:30:35,361 --> 01:30:38,330
climb to an empty church
tower in the dead of night?

1255
01:30:38,398 --> 01:30:40,662
Any child could see you'd
wind up killing yourself.

1256
01:30:40,733 --> 01:30:42,758
Killing is what led you here.

1257
01:30:45,138 --> 01:30:46,867
It won't help you now.

1258
01:30:49,409 --> 01:30:51,673
Look out the window! Look!

1259
01:30:53,046 --> 01:30:55,708
Well, that's an old trick,
Mr. Wilson. A very poor trick!

1260
01:30:55,782 --> 01:30:57,249
Tricks!

1261
01:30:57,316 --> 01:30:59,648
That's all you know is tricks!

1262
01:30:59,719 --> 01:31:01,653
I don't need any tricks!

1263
01:31:01,721 --> 01:31:05,020
No matter what happens to me,
tricks won't do you any good!

1264
01:31:05,091 --> 01:31:07,616
You're finished,
Herr Franz Kindler!

1265
01:31:20,189 --> 01:31:23,968
The citizens of Harper,
they've come after you.

1266
01:31:24,043 --> 01:31:25,635
The plain, little,
ordinary people,

1267
01:31:25,711 --> 01:31:27,872
the ones you've been laughing
at, Herr Franz Kindler!

1268
01:31:27,947 --> 01:31:30,006
Well, you can't
fool them anymore.

1269
01:31:30,083 --> 01:31:33,849
Oh, sure, you can kill me, Mary,
half the people down there,

1270
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,444
but there's no escape.

1271
01:31:36,155 --> 01:31:39,420
You had a world and it closed in
on you till there was only Harper.

1272
01:31:39,492 --> 01:31:42,154
That closed in on you and
there was only this room!

1273
01:31:42,228 --> 01:31:44,958
And this room, too,
is closing in on you!

1274
01:31:46,047 --> 01:31:49,224
It's not true, the things they say
I did. It was all their idea.

1275
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:52,829
- I followed orders.
- You gave the orders.

1276
01:31:52,905 --> 01:31:54,600
I only did my duty.

1277
01:31:56,943 --> 01:31:59,145
Don't send me back to them.
I can't face them.

1278
01:31:59,175 --> 01:32:01,868
- I'm not a criminal.
- You are.

1279
01:32:26,313 --> 01:32:27,929
Give me that gun!

1280
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:28,641
All right, Mr. Wilson, Mary's
safe. Let me give you a hand.

1281
01:33:28,671 --> 01:33:30,444
No, no, no, no. No, thanks.

1282
01:33:30,474 --> 01:33:33,566
- Hi, what happened?
- V Day in Harper.

1283
01:33:33,596 --> 01:33:35,040
I don't get that.

1284
01:33:35,070 --> 01:33:36,469
Come on down!

1285
01:33:36,499 --> 01:33:38,946
Oh, no, not until you
get me a new ladder.

1286
01:33:38,976 --> 01:33:42,073
I've had my ankle busted
and my head conked.

1287
01:33:42,103 --> 01:33:45,006
From here on in, my friends,
I'm taking it easy.

1288
01:33:45,036 --> 01:33:47,466
Well, I'll get you another
ladder, Mr. Wilson.

1289
01:33:47,496 --> 01:33:49,635
You've had enough trouble.

1290
01:33:49,665 --> 01:33:51,391
Good night, Mary.

1291
01:33:52,011 --> 01:33:53,504
Pleasant dreams.
